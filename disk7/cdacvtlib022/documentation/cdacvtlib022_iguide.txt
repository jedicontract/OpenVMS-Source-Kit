              Digital CDA Run-    A version of CDA Run-Time Services is
              Time Services or    supplied with the Converter Library
              CDA Base Services   kit, but DECwindows[TM] non-Motif
                                  systems cannot run CDA Run-Time
                                  Services V1.0.

                                  The Converter Library installation

                                  are running a pre-Motif version
                                  of DECwindows. Digital recommends
                                  that you upgrade your system to
                                  a Motif[R] version of DECwindows.
                                  The CDA Converter Library V2.2 is
                                  not warranted to run under older
                                  versions of CDA, but if you have
                                  a pre-Motif version of DECwindows
                                  and cannot upgrade, it is possible

        1.2.1 CDA Run-Time Services V1.0 Kit Included with the CDA
              Converter Library

              The Converter Library V2.2 installation kit includes the
              CDA Run-Time Services V1.0 kit for the CDA base components
              such as the CDA Viewer and the CDA toolkit. The Converter
              Library V2.2 installation procedure automatically installs
              the CDA Run-Time Services kit if your CDA base software
              needs to be updated.[1]

              ___________________
              [1]If you have a non-Motif version of DECwindows
                 currently installed, CDA Run-Time Services V1.0
                 will not be installed on your system.  CDA Run-Time
                 services is not compatible with DECwindows non-Motif

           The CDA Run-Time Services V1.0 kit is packaged as a
           layered product, and is equivalent to the CDA Base
           Services software installed with your OpenVMS Motif
           software. The CDA Run-Time Services update ensures that
           the latest CDA Base Services product is available on your
           system.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              Since your system may have an existing version
              of the CDA base software, you will not need to
              make adjustments to quotas as a result of the
              installation of the new CDA Run-Time Services V1.0
              kit. For more information about the CDA Run-Time
              Services installation requirements, see the CDA Run-
              Time Installation Guide for VMS which is available
              from the following location:

              SYS$HELP:CDART010_INS_GUIDE.TXT

              This manual contains useful information about the
              CDA base software files updated with this kit.

              _____________________________________________________

        1.3.2 Removing Previous Known Images

              None of the converter images are installed using the
              VMS Install Utility (INSTALL). If you have installed a
              previous converter image as a known image, ensure that you
              remove it as a known image before running the installation
              procedure.

              To check that a converter is not INSTALLED, enter the
              following at the DCL prompt:

              $ INSTALL LIST converter-name

              To remove a converter as a known image before running the
              installation procedure, enter the following at the DCL
              prompt:

              $ INSTALL DELETE converter-name

        1.3.3 Privileges and Disk Space

              To install the CDA Converter Library, you must be logged
              in to an account that has SETPRV or at least the following
              privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                VMSINSTAL turns off the BYPASS privilege at the
                start of the installation.

                _____________________________________________________

              The CDA Converter Library's requirements for free disk
              storage space are different during installation and
              after installation. Table 1-2 summarizes the storage
              requirements.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Most OpenVMS systems will contain a version of the
                CDA Run-Time Services software. Hence, the disk
                space requirements listed in Table 1-2 contains the
                maximum storage requirements for systems that do

     1.3.4 System Parameters

           Installing the CDA Converter Library requires certain
           system parameter settings. Table 1-3 lists the minimum
           required system parameter values for the installation.
           Depending on the kinds of programs and applications
           running at your site, you might need higher values for
           some settings.

              __________________________________________________________

              The following sections show you how to:

              o  Check system parameter values.

              o  Calculate values for the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS
                 system parameters.

              o  Change parameter values with the OpenVMS AUTOGEN
                 command procedure.

              o  Set dynamic parameters [such as PQL_DASTLM] with the
                 OpenVMS System Generation Utility (SYSGEN).

        1.3.4.1 Checking System Parameter Values

              To check the values of your system parameters, enter the
              following command at the DCL prompt to invoke the System
              Generation Utility (SYSGEN):

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN>

              At the SYSGEN> prompt, enter the SHOW command to display
              the value of a system parameter. The values displayed
              should equal or exceed the value of each system parameter
              listed in Table 1-3. The following example displays the
              value for the WSMAX system parameter:

              SYSGEN> SHOW WSMAX

     Preparing to Install the CDA Converter Library on OpenVMS
     1.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

           After checking the parameters with the SHOW command, enter
           the EXIT command at the SYSGEN> prompt to return to the
           DCL level.

     1.3.4.2 Calculating the Values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS

           To install and run the CDA Converter Library, you must
           have sufficient free global pages and global sections.
           You must first find out how many free global pages and
           sections you have on your system. Then use AUTOGEN if
           you need to increase the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS system
           parameters.

           If you are installing the CDA Converter Library on an
           OpenVMS Version 5.2 system, you can use the WRITE command
           with the F$GETSYI lexical function to find the number
           of free global pages and global sections. The following
           example shows how to get this information at your terminal
           (the default for SYS$OUTPUT):

           $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")
           15848
           $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")
           24

           If the values displayed by the system are greater than
           the values in Table 1-3, you do not need to increase
           the values for these parameters. If the value of free
           global pages or global sections is less than the value in
           Table 1-3, you must increase the system parameter setting.

           Section 1.3.4.3 describes the procedures for increasing
           these values using AUTOGEN.

     1.3.4.3 Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN

           Use the AUTOGEN command procedure to change system
           parameters. AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for
           parameters that are associated with the values you reset
           manually. To change system parameters with AUTOGEN, edit
           the following file:

           SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

           Use an editor to access the file. To change a parameter
           value listed in this file, delete the current value
           associated with that parameter and enter the new value.

               Preparing to Install the CDA Converter Library on OpenVMS
                                 1.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

              To add a new parameter, add a line to the file that
              includes both the name of the parameter and its value.
              For example:

              WSMAX = 1024

              Use ADD_GBLPAGES or ADD_GBLSECTIONS to modify incremental
              parameters such as GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS. The following
              example increases the global page setting by 2000:

              ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                When you set the page file quota, do not use a value
                that exceeds the amount of page file space available
                on the system.

                _____________________________________________________

              After you make all your changes, exit from the editor and
              execute the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
              parameters. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

              When you specify REBOOT, AUTOGEN performs an automatic
              system shutdown and then reboots the system. Any users
              logged on to the system are immediately disconnected
              during the shutdown. The automatic reboot puts the new
              parameter values into effect.

              The AUTOGEN Utility automatically adjusts some of the
              SYSGEN parameters based on the consumption of resources
              since the last reboot. If you do not want to take
              advantage of this automatic adjustment, include the
              NOFEEDBACK qualifier on the AUTOGEN command line.

              For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the OpenVMS
              System Management Subkit.

     1.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

     1.3.4.4 Setting Dynamic System Parameter Values

           Use the System Generation Utility (SYSGEN) to set dynamic
           parameters. Dynamic parameters changed with the SYSGEN
           WRITE ACTIVE command become active immediately without
           any need to reboot your system. In fact, rebooting
           returns dynamic system parameter values to their previous
           settings.

           Once you change dynamic parameter values, you should
           complete the installation before rebooting the system.
           After you finish with the installation, you can reset the
           dynamic parameters to their previous values or let them be
           reset automatically when you next reboot your system.

           The CDA Converter Library requires the dynamic parameter
           value listed in Table 1-4.

           Table_1-4_Required_Dynamic_Parameter_Values_______________

           Dynamic_Parameter__________Value__________________________

           PQL_DASTLM                 24

           PQL_DBIOLM                 18

           PQL_DDIOLM_________________18_____________________________

           If the dynamic parameter values on your system are less
           than the values previously listed, use the following
           series of commands to change the values. This example
           changes the PQL_DASTLM value to 24.

           $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
           SYSGEN> USE ACTIVE
           SYSGEN> SET PQL_DASTLM 24
           SYSGEN> WRITE ACTIVE
           SYSGEN> EXIT

     1.4 ALL-IN-1 Special Requirements

           The following sections contain information about
           restrictions and requirements specific to ALL-IN-1[TM]
           users. The information is structured as follows:

           o  Installation restrictions for ALL-IN-1

              o  Known image requirements for ALL-IN-1

        1.4.1 Installation Restrictions for ALL-IN-1

              The Converter Library V2.2 bundles CDA Run Time V1.0
              (equivalent software to Base Services V1.7), therefore the
              CDAPAT011 patch kit is no longer required. The CDAPAT011
              patch kit checks the version number of your current CDA
              Base Services software, therefore it will not replace
              CDA Run-Time Services V1.0. You can install CDA Run-Time
              Services V1.0 if you are in doubt as to how up-to-date
              your CDA Base Services software is.

                ______________________ Caution ______________________

                You must not install the CDAPAT011 patch kit after
                installing the Converter Library V2.2.

                _____________________________________________________

        1.4.2 Known Image Requirements for ALL-IN-1

              ALL-IN-1 is a privileged image, therefore any converters
              used by ALL-IN-1 must be installed as a known image with
              privileges using the OpenVMS command, INSTALL. This also
              applies to the various CDA Base Services images. See
              Section 3.3.3 for more information about how to install
              converters as known images.

        1.5 Process Account Quotas

              The account you use to install the CDA Converter Library
              must have sufficient quotas to enable you to perform the
              installation. Table 1-5 summarizes the process quotas
              required for the installation account.

           User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT. Use
           the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to verify and
           change user account quotas. First set your directory to
           SYS$SYSTEM and then run AUTHORIZE:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
           $ RUN AUTHORIZE
           UAF>

           At the UAF> prompt, enter the SHOW command with an account
           name to check a particular account. For example:

           UAF> SHOW SMITH

           To change a quota, enter the MODIFY command. The following
           example changes the FILLM quota for the SMITH account and
           then exits from the utility:

           UAF> MODIFY SMITH /FILLM=50
           UAF> EXIT

           After you exit from the utility, the system displays
           messages indicating whether or not changes were made.
           Once the changes have been made, you must log out and log
           in again for the new quotas to take effect.

           For more information about modifying account quotas, see
           the description of the Authorize Utility in the OpenVMS
           System Management Subkit.

        1.6 VMSINSTAL Requirements

              When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

              o  Whether you have set your default device and directory
                 to SYS$UPDATE

              o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account

              o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation

              o  Whether DECnet is running

              o  Whether any users are logged in to the system

              Note that VMSINSTAL requires that the installation account
              have a minimum of the following quotas:

                 ASTLM = 24
                 BIOLM = 18
                 BYTLM = 18 000
                 DIOLM = 18
                 ENQLM = 30
                 FILLM = 20

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks if you want to continue the
              installation. In some instances, you can enter YES to
              continue. To stop the installation process and correct
              the situation, enter NO or press RETURN. Then correct the
              problem and restart the installation.

        1.7 Backing up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if
              you have backed up your system disk. Digital recommends
              that you do a system disk backup before installing any
              software.

              Use the backup procedures that are established at your
              site. For details on performing a system disk backup, see
              the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS System
              Management Subkit.

                         Installing the CDA Converter Library on OpenVMS



              This chapter explains how to install the CDA Converter
              Library on OpenVMS systems. Section 2.1 contains a step-
              by-step description of the installation procedure. This
              chapter contains the following:

              o  The installation procedure

              o  Error recovery

        2.1 The Installation Procedure

              The CDA Converter Library installation procedure consists
              of a series of questions and informational messages. See
              Appendix A for a sample installation.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/y. When you press Ctrl/y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              exits. You can then start the installation again.

              To install the CDA Converter Library, do the following:

              1. Invoke VMSINSTAL

                 @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name OPTIONS
        N

                 To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command
                 procedure from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM
                 account. VMSINSTAL is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. The
                 following list defines the elements of the VMSINSTAL
                 command procedure:

     Installing the CDA Converter Library on OpenVMS
     2.1 The Installation Procedure

              saveset-name
              The installation name for the component. For the CDA
              Converter Library, use the following installation name:

              CDACVTLIB022

              device-name
              The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
              media. For example, MTA0: is the device name for a tape
              drive. It is not necessary to use the console drive for
              this installation. However, if you do use the console
              drive, you should replace any media you removed once
              the installation is complete.

              OPTIONS N
              An optional parameter that indicates you want to see
              the question on release notes. If you do not include
              the OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask you
              about the release notes. You should review the release
              notes before proceeding with the installation in
              case they contain additional information about the
              installation. If you are restarting the installation
              and have already reviewed the release notes, you do not
              need to specify OPTIONS N.

              There are several other options as follows that you can
              select when you invoke VMSINSTAL:

              o  Auto_answer option (A): Initially creates a file
                 that contains your answers to VMSINSTAL questions
                 and prompts. You can then use the option (and the
                 answer file) to save time during a reinstallation
                 (typically after upgrading your system).

              o  Get save set option (G): Allows you to store product
                 save sets temporarily on a magnetic tape or in a
                 disk directory.

              o  File log option (L): Logs all activity to the
                 terminal during installation.

              o  Alternate root option (R): Allows you to install
                 the product to a system root other than that of the
                 running system.

                         Installing the CDA Converter Library on OpenVMS
                                          2.1 The Installation Procedure

                 See the OpenVMS documentation on software installation
                 in the OpenVMS System Management Subkit for detailed
                 information about these options. If you specify more
                 than one option, separate the options with commas (for
                 example, OPTIONS A, N).

                 The following example invokes VMSINSTAL to install the
                 CDA Converter Library from tape drive MTA0: and shows
                 the system response. This example uses the OPTIONS N
                 release note parameter.

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL CDACVTLIB022 MTA0: OPTIONS N

                      VAX/VMS Software Product Installation Procedure V5.4-3

                 It is 01-Aug-1993 at 10:30.)
                 Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

                 If you do not supply either the product name or the
                 device name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information
                 later in the installation procedure. VMSINSTAL does
                 not prompt you for any options, so be sure to include
                 OPTIONS N on the VMSINSTAL command line to access the
                 release notes during the installation.

                 If you are installing on OpenVMS Version 5.2 or higher,
                 VMSINSTAL does not check the DECnet status. You can
                 install the CDA Converter Library while DECnet is up
                 and running.

              2. Confirm system backup

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                 VMSINSTAL asks if you are satisfied with your system
                 backup. You should always back up your system disk
                 before performing an installation. If you are satisfied
                 with the backup of your system disk, press <RETURN>.
                 Otherwise, enter NO to discontinue the installation.
                 After you back up your system disk, you can restart the
                 installation.

              3. Mount the media

     Installing the CDA Converter Library on OpenVMS
     2.1 The Installation Procedure

                  Please mount the first volume of the set on MTA0:.
                  * Are you ready? YES
                  %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, CDACVTLIB MOUNTED ON _$$MTA0:  (NODE 1)
                 The following products will be processed:

               CDACVTLIB V2.2

                   Beginning installation of CDACVTLIB V2.2 at 20:01

                   %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

              You should now mount the first distribution volume on
              the device you specified when you invoked VMSINSTAL.
              The device name appears in the line preceding the
              question. VMSINSTAL then asks you if you are ready
              to continue with the installation.

              If you respond YES to indicate that you are ready,
              VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing
              the CDA Converter Library has been mounted on the
              specified device and that the installation has begun.

              If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
              VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, enter
              NO in response to the "Are you ready?" question. To
              abort the installation for other reasons, press Ctrl/y.

           4. Mount additional media volumes

              %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _MTA0: for reading

              Enter "YES" when ready:

              If your installation kit contains more than one volume,
              VMSINSTAL prompts you to mount the additional volumes
              and then asks you to indicate that you are ready for
              the installation to proceed.

           5. Select a release notes option

                                          2.1 The Installation Procedure

                 Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

                 Additional Release Notes Options:

                  1.  Display release notes
                  2.  Print release notes
                  3.  Both 1 and 2
                  4.  None of the above

                 * Select option [2]:

                 If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL,
                 you are now asked to choose one of the four options for
                 reviewing the release notes.

                 If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes immediately on the console terminal. You can
                 terminate the display at any time by pressing Ctrl/c.

                 If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for the
                 name of the print queue that you want to use:

                 * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                 You can press <RETURN> to send the file to the default
                 output print device or you can enter another queue
                 name.

                 If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes immediately on the console terminal and then
                 prompts you for a queue name for the printed version.

                 Select option 4 if you have already reviewed the
                 release notes and are restarting the installation.

                 Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following question:

                  * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES
                  %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been
                  successfully moved to SYS$HELP.

                 To continue the installation, enter YES. Otherwise,
                 press <RETURN>. In either case, the release notes are
                 copied to a file in the SYS$HELP directory:

              SYS$HELP:CDACVTLIB022.RELEASE_NOTES

              ________________________Note ________________________

              The name of the release notes file installed by
              VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name and
              version number. Do not delete release notes for
              previous versions of the CDA Converter Library.

              _____________________________________________________

           6. Purge files

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

              You have the option to purge files from previous ver-
              sions of the CDA Converter Library that are superseded
              by this installation. Purging is recommended; however,
              if you need to keep files from the previous version,
              enter NO in response to the question.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              If you choose to purge the files, the Installation
              Verification Procedure (IVP) will not be initiated.
              See Section 3.2 for more information.

              _____________________________________________________

           7. Choose the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
              option

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

              The installation procedure now asks if you want to run
              the IVP. The IVP for the CDA Converter Library checks
              to be sure that the installation is successful. It is
              recommended that you run the IVP.

              After the CDA Converter Library is installed, you can
              run the IVP independently to verify that the software
              is available on your system. You might need to run the
              IVP after a system failure to make sure that users can
              access the CDA Converter Library.

                                          2.1 The Installation Procedure

              8. Respond to license registration queries

                 Product:       CDA-CONVERTER-LIBRARY
                 Producer:      DEC
                 Version:       2.2
                 Release Date:  01-Jan-1994

                 * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

                 The installation procedure displays license information
                 about your product and then asks if you have registered
                 and loaded your Product Authorization Key (PAK).

                 If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you
                 must answer NO to this question. You must register
                 and load your PAK to successfully complete the
                 installation. If you have not done so, you should stop
                 the installation, register and load your PAK, and then
                 restart the installation.

              9. Read informational messages

                 At this point, the installation procedure displays a
                 number of informational messages that report on the
                 progress of the installation. There are no further
                 questions. If the installation procedure has been
                 successful up to this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new
                 or modified files to their target directories, updates

        2.2 Error Recovery

              If errors occur during the installation itself or when
              the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is running,
              VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
              fails, you see the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of CDACVTLIB
              V2.2 has failed.

              If the IVP fails, you see these messages:

              The CVTLIB V2.2 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for CDACVTLIB V2.2 has failed.

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exist:

              o  The operating system version is incorrect.

              o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

     3.2 Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

           The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is usually
           run during installation. If you want to run the IVP
           separately to ensure the integrity of installed files
           in the event of system problems occurring, execute the
           following command procedure:

           $ @SYS$COMMON:[SYS$TEST.CDACVTLIB]CDACVTLIB$IVP

              ________________________Note ________________________

              If you choose to purge the files, the Installation
              Verification Procedure (IVP) will not be initiated.
              See Section 2.1 for more information.

              _____________________________________________________

     3.3 Setting User Account Requirements

           To work with the CDA Converter Library, user accounts
           on your system must have certain privileges and quotas.
           The following sections contain information about these
           requirements.

     3.3.1 Privileges

           To use the CDA Converter Library, each account must have
           at least the TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges. Use the OpenVMS
           Authorize Utility to determine whether users have the
           privileges they require.

     3.3.2 User Account Quotas

           You must make sure that the appropriate user accounts
           have sufficient quotas to be able to use the CDA Converter
           Library. Table 3-1 summarizes the required user account
           quotas.

        3.3.3 Installing the CDA Converter Library as a Known Image

              If you expect the CDA Converter Library to be used
              extensively on your system, you can reduce the system
              overhead and memory requirements by installing it as a
              known image. To install the CDA Converter Library as a
              shared image on a system that is currently running, use
              the OpenVMS Install Utility (INSTALL). It is recommended
              that you install the CDA Converter Library as known on
              a system that has been rebooted recently because the
              available space in the global page table is less likely to
              be fragmented.

              To install the CDA Converter Library as a known image,
              first, determine the number of available global pages and
              global sections on your system. See Section 1.3.4.2 for
              information about how to verify and modify the number of
              global pages and global sections. Table 1-3 contains the
              guidelines for setting these parameters.

              After Installing the CDA Converter Library on OpenVMS  3-3

 



     After Installing the CDA Converter Library on OpenVMS
     3.3 Setting User Account Requirements

           Once you have reset the system parameter values, invoke
           the OpenVMS Install Utility from a privileged account and
           then install the CDA Converter Library as a known image:

           $ INSTALL
           INSTALL> ADD/LOG SYS$SHARE:DDIF$READ_AFS.EXE /OPEN /SHARED
           INSTALL> ADD/LOG SYS$SHARE:DDIF$WRITE_AFS.EXE /OPEN /SHARED
           INSTALL> EXIT

           See Appendix B for a complete list of all the files
           installed when you install the CDA Converter Library.

           When you install the CDA Converter Library as a known
           image you need to increase the global pages and global
           sections parameters. See Section 1.3.4 for information
           about changing these parameters.

     3.4 Determining and Reporting Problems

           If you encounter a problem while using the CDA Converter
           Library, report it to Digital. Depending on the nature of
           the problem and the type of support you have, you can take
           one of the following actions:

           o  Call Digital if your software contract or warranty
              agreement entitles you to telephone support.

           o  Submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

           o  Fill out and submit a Reader's Comments form if the
              problem has to do with the CDA Converter Library
              documentation. There are Reader's Comments forms at
              the back of each manual. Use the form from the manual
              in which you found the error. Include the section and
              page number.

           Review the Software Product Description (SPD) and Warranty
           Addendum for an explanation of warranty. If you encounter
           a problem during the warranty period, report the problem
           as indicated above or follow alternate instructions
           provided by Digital for reporting SPD nonconformance
           problems.

                                         Sample Installation on OpenVMS



              This section contains a sample installation of the CDA
              Converter Library on OpenVMS systems. This sample was
              run on a system that had no previous version of the CDA
              Converter Library installed. Depending on which layered
              products you have on your system, you might see additional
              messages and questions when you perform your installation.

              The sample installation assumes that DECnet has been shut
              down, that no users are logged on to your system, and that
              OPTIONS N is specified to print the release notes. The
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs at the end
              of the installation.

            Note: None of the converter images are installed using the
             VMS Install Utility (INSTALL). If any converter fails
             the IVP ensure that converter is not INSTALLED by typing
             the Open VMScommand
              $INSTALL LIST CONVERTER-NAME

             If any converter is INSTALLED it is suggested that it be removed
             by typing the OpenVMS command
              $INSTALL DELETE CONVERTER-NAME
             before this installation. See the installation guide for more
             information.

           When using DECwindows Mail for versions up to and including
           DECwindows Motif V1.0, you may experience problems when extracting
           messages.  This is addressed in later releases of DECwindows Mail.
           The problem may be eliminated by deleting or renaming converters such
           that less than 25 CDA converters are in SYS$SHARE.

           * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

           * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

               To complete the installation on a VAX 6000
               series system will take approximately:

                   10 minutes to install
                   7 minutes to run the IVP
