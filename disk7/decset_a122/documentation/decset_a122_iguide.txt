                                   Preparing to Install the DECset Tools



              This chapter presents the following information on
              preparing to install the DECset tools:

              o  Your bill of materials (BOM)

              o  Prerequisite software

              o  Accessing the online release notes

              o  Installation procedure requirements

              o  User account quotas and privileges

              o  OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF)

              o  Using VMSINSTAL

              Where appropriate, this chapter gives specific information
              on each tool.

        1.1 DECset Bill of Materials

              Your bill of materials (BOM) specifies the number and
              contents of your media. Be sure to check the contents of
              your kit against this information. If your kit is damaged
              or if you find that parts of it are missing, call your
              Digital representative.

              Distribution media must be mounted in numerical order. The
              installation procedure prompts you to mount the volumes.
              For more information on how to mount distribution media,
              see your processor-specific installation/operations guide.
              This guide details several options to the installation
              procedure.

     1.2 Prerequisite Software

           On OpenVMS Alpha systems, each DECset, Version 12.0, tool
           requires OpenVMS Alpha operating system, Version 1.5 or
           higher.

           If you are using the DECwindows interface for any tool,
           you must have OpenVMS Alpha operating system, Version 1.5
           or higher, and DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha, Version
           1.1 or higher, installed on your system.

           On OpenVMS VAX systems, each DECset, Version 12.0, tool
           requires OpenVMS Version 5.5 or higher.

           If you are using the DECwindows interface for any tool,
           you must have OpenVMS, Version 5.5 or higher, and
           DECwindows Motif, Version 1.1 or higher, installed on
           your system.

     1.3 Accessing Online Release Notes

           Each DECset tool provides online release notes. The
           prompt to display or print the release notes during the
           installation is described in Section 1.7.

           To obtain the release notes for each of the DECset
           tools after the installation, print the files shown in
           Table 1-1.

              Online help also directs you to the release notes file.
              After the installation, enter the following command line:

              $ HELP tool RELEASE_NOTES <Return>

              In the previous command line, tool represents the DCL
              command that invokes the tool on which you want help.

        1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The installation of each tool takes approximately 10 to 45
              minutes, depending on the type of media and your system
              configuration. Before installing any DECset tool, you must
              have the SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
              privileges.

              When a DECset tool is started up within the DECwindows
              interface, it will also start up the Environment Manager
              interface, if the Environment Manager is not already
              running. The Environment Manager comes up iconified when
              it is invoked in this indirect manner.

              Table 1-2 and Table 1-3 list the following system
              resources for each DECset tool you are installing:

              o  The minimum amount of free disk space during and after
                 installation.

              o  The minimum number of free global pagelets plus
                 the size (in number of disk blocks) of the file
                 SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE at installation.

              o  The minimum number of free global sections at
                 installation.

                               Preparing to Install the DECset Tools 1-3

 






           These resources reflect the amount of space needed when
           installing the DECwindows interface to each tool.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              You must ensure that your system has the necessary
              global pagelet and global section SYSGEN quotas for
              the installation. Failure to do so could cause the
              DCL tables to be corrupted in some situations.

              _____________________________________________________

           To determine the number of available global pagelets on
           your system, invoke the OpenVMS Install Utility (INSTALL)
           and enter the following command:

           $ INSTALL LIST/GLOBAL/SUMMARY <Return>

                   Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

           nnn Global Sections Used,  nnnn/nnnn Global pagelets Used/Unused

           When you enter this command, the system displays a summary
           of the number of global sections used, the number of
           global pagelets used, and the number of global pagelets
           unused. Exit from INSTALL by entering the EXIT command.

           If there are not enough pagelets available, you can
           delete an existing known image with INSTALL, or in-
           crease the GBLPAGES system parameter with the OpenVMS
           System Generation Utility (SYSGEN) by editing the
           file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and then invoking the
           SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM procedure. For more information
           on the AUTOGEN.COM procedure, see your processor-specific
           installation/operations guide.

           You can determine the number of available global sections
           by invoking SYSGEN and entering the following commands:

           $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN <Return>
           SYSGEN> USE CURRENT <Return>
           SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS <Return>
           Parameter Name   Current   Default   Minimum   Maximum   Unit   Dynamic
           --------------   -------   -------   -------   --------  ----   -------
           GBLSECTIONS          nnn       nnn       nnn        nnn  Sections
           SYSGEN> EXIT <Return>

     1-4 Preparing to Install the DECset Tools

 






              The first number displayed is the current number of global
              sections. Compare this to the number of global sections
              in use as displayed by INSTALL. For example, CMS requires
              14 global sections. Therefore, if the number of global
              sections used (displayed by INSTALL) plus 14 exceeds
              the current number of global sections, you must increase
              the number of available global sections before you can
              install CMS. To increase the number, you must increase
              the GBLSECTIONS system parameter with SYSGEN by editing
              the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and then invoking the
              SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM procedure. For more information
              on the AUTOGEN.COM procedure, see your processor-specific
              installation/operations guide.

              If the number of global sections used plus the number of
              global sections needed by the tool you are installing is
              less than the current number of global sections, you can
              exit from SYSGEN and continue.

              Table 1-2 lists the OpenVMS Alpha system resources
              required for each DECset tool. Table 1-3 lists the OpenVMS
              VAX system resources required for each DECset tool.

              o  Enqueue quota (ENQLM)

              o  Open file limit (FILLM)

              o  Timer queue entry limit (TQELM)

              Table 1-4 and Table 1-5 list specific requirements in each
              of these areas for each DECset tool you are installing.
              Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
              the current values of these quotas with the requirements
              for each tool. The account used in the following example
              is the SYSTEM account:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

              To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
              Authorize Utility's MODIFY command. For more information,
              see the OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference
              Manual.

        1.6 OpenVMS License Management Facility

              The OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF) is available
              with
              Version 1.5 (and higher) of the OpenVMS Alpha operating
              system and Version 5.5 or higher of the OpenVMS VAX
              operating system. Before you install a DECset tool, you
              must register your tool software license or an equivalent
              license such as the DECset software license.

              The license registration information you need is contained
              in the Product Authorization Key (PAK) that is shipped
              with each tool. The PAK is a paper certificate that
              contains information about the license.

              During the installation, you are asked if you have
              registered the tool license and loaded the appropriate
              authorization key. You must register and load your license
              before you start the installation in order to run the
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and use the
              software.

              To register a license under OpenVMS Alpha, Version 1.5, or
              under OpenVMS VAX, Version 5.5, first log in to the system
              manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice of two
              ways to perform the registration:

              o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When
                 it prompts you for information, respond with data from
                 your PAK.

                              Preparing to Install the DECset Tools 1-13

 






           o  Enter the DCL command LICENSE REGISTER with the
              appropriate qualifiers that correspond to information
              on the PAK.

           For complete information on using the LMF, see the
           manual on the License Management Utility in the OpenVMS
           documentation set.

     1.7 Using VMSINSTAL

           After you log in to a privileged account to install a
           DECset tool, set the default device to SYS$UPDATE: and
           then invoke VMSINSTAL, the command procedure that installs
           this product. VMSINSTAL has the following format:

           @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL toolmn device_name: [OPTIONS N]

           tool
           Represents the tool you are installing; for example,
           DECset. Note that the DECset kit has a collective
           installation procedure for the DECset components. The
           procedure will prompt you for which DECset tools to
           install.

           m
           Represents the version number of the tool you are
           installing; for example, 120 for Version 12.0. Refer to
           the DECset BIL or BOM for the version number of the tool
           you are installing.

           n
           Represents the maintenance update of the tool you are
           installing. Refer to the DECset BIL or BOM for the
           maintenance update number of your kit.

           device_name
           Represents a device name on which you plan to mount the
           media. For example, SYS$SYSDEVICE:[KITS] is the device
           name used in examples in this document.

           OPTIONS N
           Is an optional parameter you must provide if you want to
           be prompted to display or print the release notes. If you
           do not include the OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does
           not prompt you to display or print the release notes.

     1-14 Preparing to Install the DECset Tools

 






              VMSINSTAL permits the use of several other options: A, G,
              L, and R; for more information on these options, see your
              processor-specific
              installation/operations guide.

              If you do not supply the first two parameters, VMSINSTAL
              prompts you for the product and device names. If you want
              to be prompted for the product and device names and be
              prompted to display or print the release notes, enter the
              following command:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL OPTIONS N<Return>

              When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

              o  Whether you logged in to a privileged account.
                 Digital recommends that you install software from the
                 system manager's account with your default device and
                 directory set to SYS$UPDATE.

              o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
                 VMSINSTAL checks for the following quota values:

                 -  ASTLM = 24

                 -  BIOLM = 18

                 -  BYTLM = 32,768

                 -  DIOLM = 18

                 -  ENQLM = 30

                 -  FILLM = 20

              VMSINSTAL then checks whether the following conditions
              exist. If so, discontinue the conditions before resuming
              the installation procedure.

              o  Whether DECnet is up and running

              o  Whether any users are logged in to the system

              If VMSINSTAL detects either of these conditions, you will
              be asked whether you want to continue the installation. If
              you want to continue, type YES. If you want to stop the
              installation, press Return.

           You must register the information contained in the PAK
           that is shipped with DECset by using either the OpenVMS
           LICENSE command procedure (SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE) or the
           LICENSE REGISTER and LICENSE LOAD commands, as described
           in the OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

                                               Installing the DECset Kit



              The purpose of the DECset installation procedure is two-
              fold: to provide the installer a single point of entry for
              installing any or all DECset components, and to minimize
              the need for user interaction during installation.

              This collective procedure acts as a parent KITINSTAL
              procedure to the individual component installations. The
              procedure spawns off one subprocess per DECset component
              with default instructions on how to install the respective
              component.

              The DECset installation procedure does the following:

              o  Queries for which components to install

              o  Checks system resources required to perform serial
                 installations of the components

              o  Queries for responses to the questions asked as each
                 component is installed

              o  Installs the selected DECset components one by one

              Section 2.8 explains how to install the optional save sets
              that contain documentation for DECset. Please refer to
              the Online Documentation release notes for the contents of
              these save sets.

        2.1 Prerequisite Software

              To use the command-line interface, all DECset for OpenVMS,
              Version 12.0, components require OpenVMS VAX operating
              system, Version 5.5 or higher.

              To use the DECwindows user interface, all DECset for
              OpenVMS, Version 12.0, components require both OpenVMS
              Alpha operating system, Version 1.5 or higher, and
              DECwindows Motif, Version 1.1 or higher.

     2.2 Accessing the DECset Online Release Notes

           DECset provides online release notes for all the
           components when you invoke VMSINSTAL by specifying
           DECSET120. The prompt to display or print the release
           notes before installation appears in step 3 of the
           installation procedure when you invoke VMSINSTAL with
           the OPTIONS N parameter.

           To obtain the release notes after the installation, print
           the following file:

           SYS$HELP:DECSET120.RELEASE_NOTES

     2.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

           Minimum free disk space, global pages, and global section
           requirements will depend on which components you choose to
           install through the collective procedure.

           DECset's requirements for free disk storage space are
           different during installation and after installation.
           Table 2-1 and Table 2-2 list the storage requirements.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                On systems with limited disk space, install two or
                three DECset components then repeat the installation
                procedure until you have installed the entire kit.
                If you have all or part of DECset already installed,
                your space requirements will be less. See Chapter 1
                for individual component installation requirements
                to calculate totals for system resource needs.

              You will need 150,000 free blocks for the disk where you
              plan to copy the distribution kit. The 150,000 free blocks
              include the DECset online documentation save sets.

              To install DECset you must be logged in to an account that
              has the SETPRV privilege or the following privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

        2.4 Using VMSINSTAL

              After you log in to a privileged account to install
              DECset, set the default directory to SYS$UPDATE. Then
              invoke the VMSINSTAL command procedure to install this
              product. An example of this procedure is shown in steps 1
              and 2 of Section 2.6.

              The VMSINSTAL command procedure has the following syntax:

              @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DECSET120 ddn: [OPTIONS N]

              ddn:
              The name of the device where the distribution volumes
              will be mounted for the DECset installation media. In this
              format, dd is the device code and n is the unit number.
              You do not have to use the console drive to install
              DECset. If you do use the console drive, replace any media
              you removed from the drive. (The examples in this guide
              use MUA0: for the device name.)

                                           Installing the DECset Kit 2-3

 






           OPTIONS N
           An optional parameter you provide if you want to be
           prompted to display or print the release notes. If you
           omit the OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not prompt
           you to display or print the release notes.

           If you omit the first two parameters, VMSINSTAL prompts
           you for the product and device names. If you want to be
           prompted for the product and device names and to display
           or print the release notes, enter the following
           DCL command:

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL
































     2-4 Installing the DECset Kit

 






              The VMSINSTAL procedure checks the following:

              o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account.
                 Digital recommends that you install software from the
                 system manager account with your default device and
                 directory set to SYS$UPDATE.

              o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
                 The VMSINSTAL procedure checks for the following quota
                 values:

                    ASTLM = 18
                    BIOLM = 20
                    BYTLM = 60,000
                    DIOLM = 11
                    ENQLM = 6
                    FILLM = 50
                    PGFLQUO = 30,000
                    PRCLM = 18
                    TQELM = 10
                    WSDEF = 512
                    WSQUO = 1,024
                    WSEXTENT = 3,600

                 The VMSINSTAL procedure then checks whether the
                 following conditions exist. If so, discontinue the
                 conditions before resuming the installation procedure.

                 -  Whether DECnet is up and running

                 -  Whether any users are logged in to the system

                 If VMSINSTAL detects either of these conditions,
                 the procedure asks whether you want to continue the
                 installation. If you want to continue, enter YES
                 and press the Return key. If you want to stop the
                 installation, press Return.

        2.5 Preparing for DECset Component Installation

              Use the OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF) to
              register your DECset component licenses. The license
              registration information you need is contained in the
              Product Authorization Key (PAK) that is shipped with
              DECset. The PAK is a paper certificate that contains
              information about the license you have to load in order to

                                           Installing the DECset Kit 2-5

 






           run some of the DECset components. All DECset components
           require a license.

     2.6 Installing DECset Components

           This section contains excerpts from the installation
           procedure and explains each step. Defaults appear in
           brackets ([])  throughout the installation procedure.

           To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
           Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
           deletes all the files it has created up to that point and
           then returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
           installation after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must proceed from
           step 2.

           Step 1: Log in to a privileged account and set your
           default device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

              .
              .
              .
           Username: SYSTEM <Return>
           Password:  <Return>
           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <Return>


           Step 2: Invoking VMSINSTAL with a kit on CD-ROM.

           $ @VMSINSTAL DECSET120 SYS$SYSDEVICE:[KITS] OPTIONS N

                 OpenVMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.n

           It is 26-MAY-1995 at 09:00.
           Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

           * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

           If you are satisfied with the backup of your system disk,
           press Return. Otherwise, enter NO and press the Return key
           to discontinue the installation.

              %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to SYS$HELP.
                 .
                 .
                 .

              Step 3: Select a release notes option.

              This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in step
              2.

              Release Notes Options:

                  1. Display release notes
                  2. Print release notes
                  3. Both 1 and 2
                  4. Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
                  5. Do not display, print, or copy release notes

              * Select option [2]: <Return>

              If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. To terminate the display at any
              time, press Ctrl/C.

              If you select option 2 (the default), VMSINSTAL prompts
              you for a queue name. You can then enter a queue name or
              press the Return key, which sends the file to the default
              output print device.

              * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. To terminate the display
              at any time, press Ctrl/C. The VMSINSTAL procedure
              prompts you for a queue name for printing the release
              notes. Either enter a queue name or press the Return
              key to send the file to the default output print
              device. The DECset release notes are then copied to
              SYS$HELP:DECSET120.RELEASE_NOTES.

              If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL copies the release notes
              to SYS$HELP immediately.

           If you select option 5, VMSINSTAL does not display, print,
           or copy the release notes, but moves them to SYS$HELP.
           Typically, you select this option when you want to end the
           installation.

           Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

           * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES<Return>
           %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product release notes have been
               successfully moved to SYS$HELP.

           If you want to continue the installation, enter YES and
           press the Return key. If you enter NO (or press Return),
           VMSINSTAL discontinues the installation. In either case,
           VMSINSTAL moves the release notes to SYS$HELP.

           Step 4: Selecting components to install.

           Now you will get a menu selection to choose the component
           you want to install.

                     .
                     .
                     .

                     These are the options provided by this collective
                     installation procedure:

                     - all the DECset components
                     - Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE)
                     - Source Code Analyzer (SCA)
                     - Code Management System (CMS)
                     - DEC Test Manager
                     - Performance Coverage Analyzer (PCA)
                     - Module Management System (MMS)

                     Please choose your option(s):

           You can either elect to choose all the options or you can
           select a combination of options.

             * Do you want all the DECset components [NO]?  YES
             * Are you sure you want to install all the options [YES]?


     2-8 Installing the DECset Kit

 






              For example, if you were to choose LSE, SCA, and CMS, it
              would look like this:

                       .
                       .
                       .
                * Do you want Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE) [NO]? YES
                * Do you want Source Code Analyzer (SCA) [NO]? YES
                * Do you want Code Management System (CMS) [NO]? YES
                * Do you want DEC Test Manager [NO]?
                * Do you want Performance Coverage Analyzer (PCA) [NO]?
                * Do you want Module Management System (MMS) [NO]?

                         These are the selections you made:

                              - Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE)
                              - Source Code Analyzer (SCA)
                              - Code Management System (CMS)

                * Would you like a chance to select your options again [NO]?

              You then need to answer the questions for each of the
              DECset components that you have selected.

        2.7 Running the Installation Verification Procedures

              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for each
              DECset component checks the integrity of installed files.
              We strongly urge you to run the IVPs after you install
              the components. Each component installation puts a command
              procedure in SYS$TEST for you to invoke. The following
              list shows the DECset component IVPs:

              __________________________________________________________
              Component_____________Procedure_Name______________________

              ENVMGR                ENVMGR$IVP

              CMS                   CMS$IVP

              DEC Test Manager      DTM$IVP

              LSE                   LSE$IVP

              MMS                   MMS$IVP

           The following example shows how to invoke the LSE
           component IVP:

           $ @SYS$TEST:LSE$IVP.COM



     2.8 Installing the DECset Online Documentation

           Many DECset components have online documentation files.
           The DECset kit provides separate save sets for these
           online documentation files allowing you to install the
           files independent of the DECset kit, and also provides
           an option to install the files on a device other than
           the system disk. The DECset online documentation files
           are provided by the save sets DECSETDOCS120.A through
           DECSETDOCS120.F. The total number of free blocks needed to
           install the online documentation files is 150,000 blocks.

           To install the DECset online documentation files, invoke
           the VMSINSTAL command procedure as follows:

           @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DECSETDOCS120 ddn: [OPTIONS N]

           For more information about the DECset online documenta-
           tion, see Appendix B.

                               Installing the DEC Code Management System



              This chapter gives specific instructions on installing the
              DEC Code Management System (CMS).

        3.1 Preparing to Install CMS

              Before installing CMS, Version 3.7, you must enter the
              CMS command VERIFY on all CMS pre-Version 3 libraries.
              To correct any problems displayed by the VERIFY command,
              enter the CMS command VERIFY/REPAIR. To use CMS Version
              3.7, you are required to convert any CMS pre-Version 3
              libraries. After CMS, Version 3.7 is installed, if you
              try to access a pre-Version 3 library you receive the
              following message:

              %CMS-E-CONVERTLIB, library is a pre-Version 3 library and cannot be
                      used without conversion

              After CMS, Version 3.7 is installed, use the CMS command
              CONVERT LIBRARY to convert pre-Version 3 libraries.

              If you intend to use DEC Test Manager with CMS, see
              Section 3.3.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                CMS release notes up to and including Version
                3.7 can be found in SYS$HELP:CMSvvu.RELEASE_NOTES
                (where vv represents the major version number, and
                u represents the update number). Also, the dollar
                sign ($)  was included in the release notes format in
                Versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 only.

                _____________________________________________________


                           Installing the DEC Code Management System 3-1

 






     3.1.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

           The installation takes approximately 10 to 45 minutes,
           depending on the type of media and your system configura-
           tion. Before installing CMS, you must have the following
           privileges and resources:

           o  SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
              privileges

           o  A minimum of 9,000 blocks of free disk space during
              installation;
              7,000 blocks are used after installation.

           o  A minimum of 1,500 free global pages, plus the size (in
              number of disk blocks) of the file SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              at installation.

           o  A minimum of 14 free global sections at installation.

           o  The minimum number of OpenVMS classes necessary for
              full functionality as described in the CMS Software
              Product Description (SPD).

           These resources reflect the amount of space needed when
           installing the CMS DECwindows interface and the CMS
           software.

     3.2 User Account Quotas and Privileges

           To use CMS, each account must have a minimum of TMPMBX and
           NETMBX privileges and the following minimum requirements:

           o  AST limit (ASTLM) of 14

           o  Buffered I/O byte count quota (BYTLM) of 14,000

           o  Enqueue quota (ENQLM) of 1

           o  Open file limit (FILLM) of 6

           o  Timer queue entry limit (TQELM) of 1



     3-2 Installing the DEC Code Management System

 






        3.3 Using CMS with Other Tools

              The DECset Environment Manager is installed as part of the
              installation of the CMS component. The DECset Environment
              Manager consists of:

              o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

              o  DCL interface

              o  DECwindows interface

              The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

              DEC Test Manager requires the CMS files SYS$SHARE:CMSSHR.EXE
              and CMSPROSHR.EXE. Correct installation of CMS is
              necessary in order to use it with DEC Test Manager. Be
              aware that whenever you install or reinstall CMS (for
              example, as the result of an incorrect installation or
              upgrading to a higher version of CMS), you will also need
              to reinstall DEC Test Manager.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The file CMSPROSHR.EXE is no longer used by CMS,
                and may not be supported in future versions of CMS.
                CMSPROSHR.EXE is included in the CMS installation
                procedure only because it is used by
                DEC Test Manager.

                _____________________________________________________

        3.4 Installing CMS

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Defaults appear in
              brackets throughout the installation procedure.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              then returns you to DCL level. To retry the installation
              procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, proceed from step 2.

           Username: SYSTEM  <Return>
           Password: <Return>
           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <Return>

           Step 2: Invoke VMSINSTAL.

           $ @VMSINSTAL CMS037 MUA0: OPTIONS N <Return>

                 OpenVMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.n

           It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
           Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

           * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? YES <Return>

           If you are satisfied with the backup of your system disk,
           enter YES and press the Return key. Otherwise, enter NO
           and press Return to discontinue the installation.

           Step 3: Insert the first installation kit volume.

           Please mount the first volume of the set on MUA0:.
           * Are you ready? YES <Return>
           The following products will be processed:

               Beginning installation of CMS V3.7 at hh:mm

           %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save-set A...

           To indicate that you want to continue the installation,
           mount volume 1, enter YES and press the Return key.

           Step 4: Insert the subsequent installation kit volumes.

           %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _MUA0: for reading

           Enter "YES" when ready: YES <Return>

           The VMSINSTAL procedure prompts you to insert the next
           volume and waits for you to enter YES after inserting it.
           If you enter NO, VMSINSTAL displays the prompt again. This
           prompt is displayed only if your installation kit contains
           more than one volume.

              Step 5: Select a release notes option.

              This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in step
              2.

              Release Notes Options:

                  1. Display release notes
                  2. Print release notes
                  3. Both 1 and 2
                  4. None of the above

              * Select option [2]: <Return>

              If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. You can terminate the display
              at any time by pressing Ctrl/C.

              If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue
              name. Either enter a queue name or press the Return key to
              send the file to the default output printer.

              * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately and then prompts you for a queue
              name. Either enter a queue name or press the Return key
              to send the file to the default output printer. The CMS
              release notes are then copied to SYS$HELP:CMS$037.RELEASE_
              NOTES.

              If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL does not display or
              print the release notes, but copies them to SYS$HELP.
              Typically, you select this option to terminate the
              installation.

              Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

              * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]? YES <Return>
              %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been successfully
              moved to SYS$HELP.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The release notes file installed by VMSINSTAL is
                labeled with the current product name and version

                           Installing the DEC Code Management System 3-5

 






              number (for example, CMS037). Take care not to
              delete release notes for previous versions of CMS.

              _____________________________________________________

           Step 6: Select installation options.

           * Do you want to install the interface components [YES]? YES <Return>
           * Do you also wish to install the CMS DECwindows
           interface [YES]? YES <Return>
           * Do you also wish to install the Server for CMS Client for Windows? -

           [YES]? YES <Return>
           * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? YES <Return>

           The directories SYS$HELP, SYS$MANAGER, SYS$MESSAGE,
           SYS$SHARE, SYS$SYSTEM, SYS$STARTUP, and SYS$TEST may
           contain previous versions of CMS files. These files are
           replaced during the installation with new files, but
           the old files are not automatically purged. Purging is
           recommended. In response to the purging prompt, press
           Return to purge the files, or enter NO to keep them.

           Step 7: Respond to license registration queries.

           CMS supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
           (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
           information about your product and then asks if you have
           registered and loaded your product authorization key (PAK)
           for CMS. The following is an example of such information:

           Product:       CMS
           Producer:      DEC
           Version:       3.7
           Release Date:  dd-mmm-yyyy

           * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

           If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you
           must answer NO to this question. You must then stop the
           installation, register and load your PAK, and then restart
           the installation. If you answer YES and you have not
           registered and loaded your PAK, you are asked if you would
           like to complete the installation without running the
           Installation Verification Procedure (IVP). However, the
           next time you invoke CMS, you receive a message indicating
           that you are not licensed to run the product.

     3-6 Installing the DEC Code Management System

 






              You are then asked the following question:

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? YES <Return>

              The IVP runs tests to check whether the installation
              procedure was successful. If the installation procedure
              determines that you have insufficient quotas to run
              the IVP, it tells you which quotas need to be increased
              and asks if you would like to complete the installation
              without running the IVP. Press Return to run the IVP after
              the installation. If you do not want to run the IVP, enter
              NO in response to the prompt.

              Step 8: Read the informational messages.

              The CMS installation procedure produces a number of
              informational messages that report on the progress of the
              installation. The success of the installation is indicated
              by the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target
              directories...

              If the installation procedure is successful, the new
              or modified files are moved to their target direc-
              tories. In addition, the SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and
              SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE files are updated to include the
              new versions of the CMS help text and the CMS command-line
              definition.

              This installation will add or modify the following files:

                 DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS:CMS$DW.UID
                 DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS:CMS$DW_DEFAULTS.DAT
                 SYS$HELP:CMS$DW_HELP.HLB
                 SYS$HELP:CMS037.RELEASE_NOTES
                 SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB
                 SYS$HELP:CMS_V37_COMMANDS.PS
                 SYS$HELP:CMS_V37_COMMANDS.TXT
                 SYS$HELP:CMS_V37_MESSAGES.PS
                 SYS$HELP:CMS_V37_MESSAGES.TXT
                 SYS$HELP:CMS_V37_CALLROUTINES.PS
                 SYS$HELP:CMS_V37_CALLROUTINES.TXT
                 SYS$MSG:CMSMSG.EXE
                 SYS$SHARE:CMS$EVENT_ACTION.EXE
                 SYS$SHARE:CMSPROSHR.EXE
                 SYS$SHARE:CMSSHR.EXE

                           Installing the DEC Code Management System 3-7

 






              SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES.EXE
              SYS$STARTUP:CMS$STARTUP.COM
              SYS$SYSTEM:CMS$DW.EXE
              SYS$SYSTEM:CMS.EXE
              SYS$TEST:CMS$IVP.COM
              VUE$LIBRARY:CMS$PROFILE.VUE$DAT
              VUE$LIBRARY:CMS$VUE_STARTUP.COM

           If you entered YES in response to the prompt that requests
           a file purge in step 6, previous versions of the CMS files
           are now purged.

           Step 9: Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

           If you chose to run the IVP in step 7, VMSINSTAL now calls
           the IVP to verify that CMS was successfully installed:

           %CMS-I-IVPBEGIN, Begin Installation Verification Procedure
                  .
                  .
                  .
           %CMS-I-IVPEND, End Installation Verification Procedure

           Step 10: End the installation procedure.

              Installation of CMS V3.7 completed at hh:mm

              VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

           $ LOGOUT <Return>
           SYSTEM     logged out at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ss

           When the product installation procedure is complete, you
           can choose to install more products or to log out (as
           shown here). If you removed any media from the console
           drive before beginning the installation, you must replace
           it now.

           The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in the
           process symbol tables during the installation. Therefore,
           if you are going to continue using the system manager's
           account and you want to restore these symbols, you must
           log out and log in again.

        3.4.1 Installing CMS on a VAXcluster

              If you want to run CMS on multiple nodes of a VAXcluster,
              first check to see that you have the appropriate software
              license. Then, follow these steps after installing CMS:

              1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
                 on each node in the VAXcluster on which CMS is to be
                 executed as described in the
                 OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

              2. Run SYS$STARTUP:CMS$STARTUP.COM on each node of the
                 cluster that has a software license. In addition, you
                 must add the following line to your system startup
                 procedure, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:CMS$STARTUP.COM

                 To use the product on other nodes in the VAXcluster,
                 you must replace the version of the DCL tables that is
                 installed on the other VAXcluster nodes. To do this,
                 perform the following steps:

                 a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

                 b. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

                    $ INSTALL REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

                 c. Repeat steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

              See Chapter 9 for information on post installation
              procedures.

                            Installing the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor



              This chapter explains how to install the DEC Language-
              Sensitive Editor (LSE).

        4.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

              LSE, Version 4.3 requires the OpenVMS VAX operating
              system, Version 5.5 or higher, OpenVMS Alpha operating
              system, Version 1.5 or higher, and DECwindows Motif,
              Version 1.1. See the SPD for this product for additional
              information about required and optional software. Also,
              see the SPD for information about required OpenVMS classes
              and tailoring.

              The DECset Environment Manager is installed as part of the
              installation of the LSE component. The DECset Environment
              Manager consists of:

              o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

              o  DCL interface

              o  DECwindows interface

              The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

              The installation takes approximately 5 to 30 minutes,
              depending on the type of media and your system configura-
              tion. Before installing LSE, you must have the following
              privileges and resources:

              o  SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
                 privileges.

              o  A minimum of 40,000 blocks of free disk space during
                 the installation; 13,500 blocks of free disk space
                 after the installation of LSE. Approximately 300 blocks
                 of free disk space should be added to the disk space

                        Installing the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor 4-1

 






              after installation for each language that you choose to
              have supported by LSE.

           o  A minimum of 2 MB of physical memory.

           o  A minimum of 6,000 free global pages, plus the size (in
              number of disk blocks) of the file SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              at installation, For most efficient operation, you will
              need a total of 6,000 free global pages, plus the size
              of SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE after installation.

           o  A minimum of 15 free global sections at installation;
              12 global sections are used after installation.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              You must ensure that your system has the necessary
              global page and global section SYSGEN quotas for the
              installation. Failure to do so could cause the DCL
              tables to be corrupted in some situations.

              _____________________________________________________

     4.1.1 User Account Quotas and Privileges

           To use LSE, each account must have TMPMBX and NETMBX
           privileges and the following requirements:

           o  AST quota (ASTLM) 24 (minimum)

           o  Buffered I/O limit (BIOLM) 18 (minimum)

           o  Buffered I/O byte count quota (BYTLM) 4,096 (minimum)

           o  Direct I/O limit (DIOLM) 18 (minimum)

           o  Enqueue quota (ENQLM) 30 (minimum)

           o  Open file quota (FILLM) 20 (minimum)

           o  Paging file quota (PGFLQUOTA) 20,000 pages (minimum)

              A paging file quota (PGFLQUOTA) of 40,000 pages is
              recommended if you are using the REPORT command.

           o  Subprocess creation quota (PRCLM) 5 (minimum)

           o  Working set size (WSDEF) 1,024 pages (minimum); 2,048
              to 4,096 pages (optimum)

     4-2 Installing the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor

 






              A FILLM of 20 is appropriate for a typical LSE usage
              pattern and allows LSE to exhibit full functionality.
              It may be necessary to grant higher FILLM quotas to user
              accounts where LSE is frequently used to edit a large
              number of files simultaneously. Buffer-change journaling
              causes user accounts to consume increased quantities of
              FILLM. One buffer-change journal file is maintained for
              each editing buffer. For example, 30 user buffers that are
              journaled require a total of 30 units of FILLM.

              The items in the following list all require additional
              units of FILLM. This list is provided to help you
              determine your FILLM requirements.

              o  Buffer-change journal files

              o  SCA databases

              o  Reading and writing of source files

              o  Diagnostic file for the REVIEW command

              o  Keystroke journaling

              o  Image activation of other tools, such as Source Code
                 Analyzer (SCA) and DEC Code Management System (CMS)

              Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
              the current values of these quotas with the requirements
              for LSE. For example, the account used in the following
              example is the SYSTEM account:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

              To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
              Authorize Utility's MODIFY command. For more information,
              see the OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference
              Manual. After you log in to a privileged account to
              install LSE, invoke VMSINSTAL, the command procedure that
              installs this product. An example of this procedure is
              shown in steps 1 and 2 of Section 4.2.

              The VMSINSTAL command procedure has the following syntax:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL LSE04n ddcu: [OPTIONS N]

           n
           Represents the maintenance update of LSE. Refer to the la-
           bel on the
           LSE distribution kit or LSE BOM for the maintenance update
           number of your kit. You can also enter an asterisk (*)  in
           place of LSE04n. If you are installing from magnetic tape,
           you can use the asterisk to save installation time; the
           asterisk causes LSE to be installed with a minimum of tape
           passes.

           ddcu:
           Represents a device name where the distribution volumes
           will be mounted for the LSE installation media, where dd
           is the device code, c is the controller code, and u is
           the unit number. It is not necessary to use the console
           drive to install LSE. If you do use the console drive, you
           should replace any media you removed from the drive. MUA0:
           is the device name used in examples in this guide.

           OPTIONS N
           Is an optional parameter you should provide if you
           want to be prompted to display or print the release
           notes. If you do not include the OPTIONS N parameter,
           VMSINSTAL does not prompt you to display or print the
           release notes. The VMSINSTAL procedure permits the
           use of several other options. For more information
           on the other options, see your processor-specific
           installation/operations guide.

           If you do not supply the first two parameters, VMSINSTAL
           prompts you for the product and device names. If you wish
           to be prompted for the product and device names and to
           display or print the release notes, enter the following
           command:

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL <Return>

           When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

           o  Whether you logged in to a privileged account.
              Digital recommends that you install software from the
              system manager's account with your default device and
              directory set to SYS$UPDATE.

              o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
                 The VMSINSTAL procedure checks for the following quota
                 values:

                 -  ASTLM = 24

                 -  BIOLM = 18

                 -  BYTLM = 18,000

                 -  DIOLM = 18

                 -  ENQLM = 30

                 -  FILLM = 20

              The VMSINSTAL procedure then checks whether the following
              conditions exist. If so, discontinue the conditions before
              resuming the installation procedure.

              o  Whether DECnet is up and running

              o  Whether any users are logged in to the system

              If VMSINSTAL detects either of these conditions, you will
              be asked whether you want to continue the installation. If
              you want to continue, enter YES. If you want to stop the
              installation, press the Return key.

        4.2 Installing LSE

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Defaults appear in
              brackets throughout the installation procedure.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              then returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
              proceed from step 2.




                        Installing the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor 4-5

 






           Step 1: Log in to a privileged account and set your
           default device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

     4-6 Installing the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor

 






              The VMSINSTAL procedure prompts you to insert the next
              volume and waits for you to enter YES after inserting it.
              If you enter NO, VMSINSTAL displays the prompt again. This
              prompt is displayed only if your installation kit contains
              more than one volume.

              Step 5: Install LSE source files option.

              The installation procedure prompts you if you wish to
              install LSE source files. These files occupy approximately
              15,000 blocks of space.

              Step 6: Select a release notes option.

              This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in step
              2.

                  Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

                  Additional Release Notes Options:

                  1. Display release notes
                  2. Print release notes
                  3. Both 1 and 2
                  4. None of the above

              * Select option [2]: <Return>

              If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. You can terminate the display
              at any time by pressing
              Ctrl/C.

              If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue
              name. Either enter a queue name or press the Return key to
              send the file to the default output print device.

              * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. You can terminate the display
              at any time by pressing Ctrl/C. The VMSINSTAL procedure
              then prompts you for a queue name. Either enter a queue
              name or press the Return key to send the file to the
              default output print device. The LSE release notes are
              then copied to SYS$HELP:LSE043.RELEASE_NOTES.

                        Installing the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor 4-7

 






           If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL neither prints nor
           displays the release notes. The LSE release notes are
           copied to SYS$HELP:LSE043.RELEASE_NOTES.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              This version of the release notes file installed by
              VMSINSTAL is labeled with the current product name
              and version number. Take care not to delete release
              notes for previous versions of LSE.

              _____________________________________________________

           Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

           * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES <Return>
           %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product release notes have been successfully
               moved to SYS$HELP.

           If you want to continue the installation, enter YES and
           press the Return key. If you enter NO or press Return,
           VMSINSTAL discontinues the installation. In either case,
           VMSINSTAL moves the release notes to SYS$HELP.

           Step 7: Select installation options.

           * Do you want to install the interface components [YES]? YES <Return>
           * Do you also wish to install the LSE DECwindows interface [YES]? YES <Return>
           * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>

           The directories SYS$EXAMPLES, SYS$TEST, SYS$HELP,
           SYS$LIBRARY, SYS$MESSAGE, SYS$STARTUP, VUE$LIBRARY,
           LSE$EXAMPLE, and SYS$SYSTEM may contain previous versions
           of LSE files. These files are replaced during the
           installation with new files, but the old files are not
           automatically purged. Purging is recommended. In response
           to the purging prompt, press Return to purge the files or
           enter NO to keep them.

           * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? <Return>

           The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs
           tests to check whether the installation procedure
           was successful. Press Return to run the IVP after the
           installation. If you do not want to run the IVP, enter NO
           in response to the prompt.

              Step 8: Respond to license registration queries.

              LSE supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
              (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
              information about your product and then asks if you have
              registered and loaded your product authorization key (PAK)
              for LSE. The following is an example of such information:

              Product:       LSE
              Producer:      DEC
              Version:       4.3
              Release Date:  dd-mmm-yyyy

              * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

              If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you must
              answer NO to this question. You have to register and load
              your PAK to successfully complete the installation. If
              you have not done so, you should stop the installation,
              register and load your PAK, and then restart the
              installation.

              Step 9: Select language support.

              Templates for some languages are shipped in the LSE kit.
              The installation procedure displays the names of the
              language templates that are available in the LSE kit
              and then asks which ones should be installed. Language
              templates for other layered products that support LSE not
              mentioned in this installation procedure are provided in
              the installation kits for those layered products.

              Language templates for VAX Ada, BASIC, BLISS, C, C++, COBOL, DCL, FORTRAN,
              MACRO, Pascal and PL/I as well as templates for the LSE command language
              are included in this kit. Templates for other languages that support LSE
              and are not mentioned are provided in the installation kits for those
              languages.

              Please choose the languages for which you would like to install support:

              * Do you want to install language support for VAX ADA [YES]? <Return>
              * Do you want to install language support for VAX BASIC [YES]? <Return>
              * Do you want to install language support for VAX BLISS [YES]? <Return>
              * Do you want to install language support for VAX C [YES]? <Return>

                        Installing the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor 4-9

 






           * Do you want to install language support for VAX COBOL [YES]? <Return>
           * Do you want to install language support for VAX DCL [YES]? <Return>
           * Do you want to install language support for VAX FORTRAN [YES]? <Return>
           * Do you want to install language support for VAX MACRO [YES]? <Return>
           * Do you want to install language support for VAX PASCAL [YES]? <Return>
           * Do you want to install language support for VAX PLI [YES]? <Return>
           * Do you want to install language support for DEC LSE [YES]? <Return>
           * Do you want to install language support for DEC PLSE [YES]? <Return>

           Step 10: Read informational messages.

           The LSE installation procedure produces a number of
           informational messages that report on the progress of
           the installation.

           The success of the installation is indicated by the
           following message:

     %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target directories...

           If the installation procedure is successful, the new or
           modified files are moved to their target directories.























     4-10 Installing the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor

 






              The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              files are updated to include the new versions of the LSE
              HELP text and the LSEDIT command-line definition:

              This installation added or modified the following files:

                      SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
                      SYS$SYSTEM:LSEDIT.EXE
                      SYS$LIBRARY:LSESHR.EXE
                      SYS$MESSAGE:LSEMSG.EXE
                      SYS$LIBRARY:LSE$CCTSHR.EXE
                      SYS$LIBRARY:LSE$DECWSHR.EXE
                      SYS$LIBRARY:PSE$COMMENTS.EXE
                      SYS$LIBRARY:LSE$DEFAULTS.DAT
                      SYS$LIBRARY:LSE$SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT.ENV
                      SYS$LIBRARY:LSE$SECTION.TPU$SECTION
                      SYS$LIBRARY:LSE$WIDGETS.UID
                      SYS$LIBRARY:LSE$DEBUG.TPU
                      SYS$HELP:LSE$HELP.HLB
                      SYS$HELP:LSE$MENU.HLB
                      SYS$HELP:LSE$KEYPAD.HLB
                      SYS$HELP:LSE$CLIHELP.HLB
                      SYS$STARTUP:LSE$STARTUP.COM
                      SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.LSE]LSE$USER.DIA
                      SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.LSE]LSE$USER.EXAMPLE
                      SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.LSE]LSE$USER2.EXAMPLE
                      SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.LSE]LSE$USER3.EXAMPLE
                      SYS$TEST:LSE$IVP.COM
                      SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSTEST.LSE]LSE$IVP.TPU
                      SYS$SYSROOT:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]LSE$EDIT_QUALIFIERS.EXE
                      SYS$SYSROOT:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]LSE$EDIT_OPTIONS.UID
                      SYS$SYSROOT:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]LSE$EDIT.COM
                      SYS$SYSROOT:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]LSE$PROFILE.VUE$DAT

              If you entered YES in response to the prompt that requests
              a file purge at step 7, previous versions of the LSE files
              are now purged.

              Step 11: Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

              If you chose to run the IVP in step 7, VMSINSTAL now calls
              the IVP to verify that LSE was installed successfully:

              ?? lines written to file DEV$:[USER]LSE$IVP.LIS;1

              DEC Language-Sensitive Editor IVP was successful.

                       Installing the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor 4-11

 






           Step 12: End the installation procedure.

              Installation of DEC Language-Sensitive Editor V4.3 completed at hh:mm

              VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

           $ LOGOUT <Return>
           SYSTEM     logged out at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ss

           When the product installation procedure is complete, you
           can choose to install more products or to log out (as
           shown here). If you removed any media from the console
           drive before beginning the installation, you should
           replace it now.

           The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in the
           process symbol tables during the installation. Therefore,
           if you are going to continue using the system manager's
           account and you want to restore these symbols, you should
           log out and log in again.

     4.3 Installing LSE on a VAXcluster

           If you want to run LSE on multiple nodes of a VAXcluster,
           first check to see that you have the appropriate software
           license. Then, follow these steps after installing LSE:

           1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
              on each node in the VAXcluster on which LSE is to be
              executed as described in the OpenVMS License Management
              Utility Manual.

           2. Run SYS$STARTUP:LSE$STARTUP.COM on each node of the
              cluster that has a software license.

              To ensure that LSE is installed each time the system
              is bootstrapped, include the following line in
              SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_V6.COM
              (the site-specific startup file):

              @SYS$STARTUP:LSE$STARTUP.COM

           3. To use the product on other nodes in the VAXcluster,
              you must replace the version of the DCL tables that is
              installed on the other VAXcluster nodes. To do this,
              perform the following steps:

              a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

     4-12 Installing the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor

 






                 b. Run INSTALL and enter the following command at the
                    INSTALL> prompt:

                    INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

                 c. Repeat steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

        4.4 After the Installation

              LSE is now installed and can be invoked by all users with
              the LSEDIT command.

              The installation procedure modifies the DCL command table
              so that the LSEDIT command is recognized and processed.
              However, the previous command table is still in effect
              for those users who are currently logged in. All logged-in
              users who want to use the LSEDIT command must log out of
              the system and log in again.

              You must take steps to ensure that the LSE startup
              command procedure is executed at system bootstrap time.
              If your site is using the STARTUP facility, enter the
              proper STARTUP ADD command to execute LSE$STARTUP.COM.
              If the STARTUP facility is not used at your site, edit
              SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V6.COM to include the following
              line:

              @SYS$STARTUP:LSE$STARTUP.COM

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The command procedure that should be executed at
                system bootstrap time to make the LSE executables
                known images now resides in SYS$STARTUP. Make
                sure that upon completion of the installation,
                the file specification in the site-specific
                startup command procedure used to execute the
                LSE startup command procedure is modified to be
                SYS$STARTUP:LSE$STARTUP.COM.

                _____________________________________________________

              You can use LSE to read and compose messages from the
              MAIL Utility. You can define the logical name MAIL$EDIT
              as CALLABLE_LSE in order to use the editor from MAIL.
              Note that LSE must be installed as a known image. This

           is accomplished through the editor's startup command
           procedure. Also, the DEC Code Management System (CMS)
           and Source Code Analyzer (SCA) must be installed as
           known images to be used from LSE when LSE is invoked
           from the MAIL Utility. (See Chapter 5 for instructions
           on installing SCA.)

                                     Installing the Source Code Analyzer



              This chapter explains how to install the Source Code
              Analyzer (SCA).

        5.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The DECset Environment Manager is installed as part of the
              installation of the SCA component. The DECset Environment
              Manager consists of:

              o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

              o  DCL interface

              o  DECwindows interface

              The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

              The installation of SCA, Version 4.3, takes approximately
              5 to 40 minutes, depending on the type of media and your
              system configuration. Before installing SCA, you must have
              the following privileges and resources:

              o  SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
                 privileges.

              o  A minimum of 13,000 blocks of free disk space during
                 installation; 9,000 blocks are used after installation.

              o  A minimum of 2 MB of physical memory.

              o  A minimum of 5,000 free global pages, plus the size (in
                 number of disk blocks) of the file SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
                 at installation. For most efficient operation, you will
                 need a total of 5,000 free global pages, plus the size
                 of SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE after installation.

              o  A minimum of 15 free global sections at installation;
                 12 global sections are used after installation.

     5.2 User Account Quotas and Privileges

           To use SCA, each account must have TMPMBX and NETMBX
           privileges and the following requirements:

           o  AST limit (ASTLM) 24 (minimum)

           o  Buffered I/O quota (BIOLM) 18 (minimum)

           o  Buffered I/O byte count quota (BYTLM) 18,000 (minimum)

           o  Direct I/O quota (DIOLM) 18 (minimum)

           o  Enqueue quota (ENQLM) 30 (minimum)

           o  Open file limit (FILLM) 20 (minimum)

           o  Paging file quota (PGFLQUOTA) 20,000 pages (minimum)

           o  Subprocess creation quota (PRCLM) 2 (minimum)

           o  Timer queue entry limit (TQELM) 5 (minimum)

           o  Working set size (WSDEF) 600 pages (minimum); 3,000
              pages (optimum)

           Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
           the current values of these quotas with the requirements
           for SCA. For example, the account used in the following
           example is the SYSTEM account:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
           $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
           UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

           To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
           Authorize Utility's MODIFY command. For more information,
           see the OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference
           Manual.

     5.3 SCA Server Installation

           SCA provides a server that allows remote users to access
           your local SCA libraries. The installation of this server
           is optional.

           You will be prompted during the installation as to whether
           you would like to install both the SCA server and the SCA
           client, or whether you would like to install only the SCA
           client.

     5-2 Installing the Source Code Analyzer

 






              If you elect to install only the SCA client, remote users
              will not be able to access your local SCA libraries. SCA
              users on your local system will not be affected. They will
              have the ability to use local libraries and libraries on
              remote nodes where the SCA server has been installed.

              If you elect to install the optional SCA server, accounts
              named SCA$SERVER and SCA$DEFAULT are created for the SCA
              server. The accounts are given the following quotas:

        Username: SCA$SERVER                       Owner:  SCA SERVER
        Account:  DECNET                           UIC:    [370,355] ([SCA$SERVER])

           In addition, an access control list (ACL) is set on the
           file
           SYS$SYSTEM:NETPROXY.DAT, giving the SCA$SERVER account
           read and execute access.

           If any problems occur at run time, the SCA server creates
           an error log file in SYS$SPECIFIC:[SCA$SERVER]. One
           possible error is server failure due to insufficient
           virtual memory. If this occurs frequently, you may want to
           increase PGFLQUO for the SCA$SERVER account.

           If you are reinstalling SCA, stop any previous SCA servers
           (network processes named SCA$SERVER_nnnn) so that they
           will be restarted using the new server code. Use the DCL
           commands SHOW SYSTEM/NETWORK and
           STOP/IDENTIFICATION, respectively.

        5.4 Installing SCA

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Defaults appear in
              brackets throughout the installation procedure.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              then returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
              proceed from step 2.

              Step 1: Log in to a privileged account and set your
              default device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

        <Return>

              Username: SYSTEM  <Return>
              Password:         <Return>
              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <Return>

              Step 2: Invoke VMSINSTAL.

              $ @VMSINSTAL SCA043 MUA0: OPTIONS N <Return>

                    OpenVMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.n

              It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? <Return>

              If you are satisfied with the backup of your system disk,
              press Return. Otherwise, enter NO and press the Return key
              to discontinue the installation.

              Step 3: Insert the first installation kit volume.

              Please mount the first volume of the set on MUA0:.
              * Are you ready? YES <Return>
              The following products will be processed:

                DEC Source Code Analyzer V4.3

                  Beginning installation of DEC Source Code Analyzer V4.3 at hh:mm

                                 Installing the Source Code Analyzer 5-5

 






           To indicate that you want to continue the installation,
           mount volume 1, enter YES, and press the Return key.

           Step 4: Select a release notes option.

           This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in step
           2. Release notes included with this kit are always copied
           to SYS$HELP.

           Additional Release Notes Options:

               1. Display release notes
               2. Print release notes
               3. Both 1 and 2
               4. None of the above

           * Select option [2]: <Return>

           If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
           notes immediately. You can terminate the display at any
           time by pressing
           Ctrl/C.

           If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue
           name. Either type a queue name or press Return to send the
           file to the default output print device.

           * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

           If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
           notes immediately. You can terminate the display at any
           time by pressing
           Ctrl/C. The VMSINSTAL procedure then prompts you for a
           queue name. Either enter a queue name or press the Return
           key to send the file to the default output print device.

           If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL neither prints nor
           displays the release notes. The SCA release notes are
           copied to SYS$HELP:SCA043.RELEASE_NOTES.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              This version of the release notes file installed by
              VMSINSTAL is labeled with the current product name
              and version number. Take care not to delete release
              notes for previous versions of SCA.

              _____________________________________________________

     5-6 Installing the Source Code Analyzer

 






              Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

              * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES <Return>
              %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product release notes have been successfully
                  moved to SYS$HELP.

              If you want to continue the installation, enter YES and
              press the Return key. If you enter NO or press Return,
              VMSINSTAL discontinues the installation. In either case,
              VMSINSTAL moves the release notes to SYS$HELP.

              Step 5: Insert the subsequent installation kit volumes.

              %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _MUA0: for reading

              Enter "YES" when ready: YES <Return>

              The VMSINSTAL procedure prompts you to insert the next
              volume and waits for you to enter YES after inserting it.
              If you enter NO, VMSINSTAL displays the prompt again. This
              prompt is displayed only if your installation kit contains
              more than one volume.

              Step 6: Select installation options.

        * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]? YES <Return>
        %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been successfully moved to SYS$HELP.

                  Please indicate the components of SCA that you wish to install:

                      1 - Both SCA client and server
                      2 - SCA client only

        * Enter the number corresponding to the SCA components to install [1]: <Return>

        The DECset Environment Manager is installed as part of the installation
        of this DECset component.

        The DECset Environment Manager consists of:

        A run-time component used by DECset layered products,
        a DCL interface, and
        a DECwindows interface.

        The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

        * Do you want to install the interface components [YES]? YES <Return>
        * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>

                                 Installing the Source Code Analyzer 5-7

 






           If you elect to install only the SCA client, remote users
           will not be able to access your local SCA libraries. SCA
           users on your local system will not be affected. They will
           have the ability to use local libraries and libraries on
           remote nodes where the SCA server has been installed.

           The files in SYS$SYSTEM and SYS$LIBRARY contain previous
           versions of SCA files. These files are replaced during
           the installation with new files, but the old files are not
           automatically purged. Purging is recommended. In response
           to the purging prompt, press Return to purge the files or
           enter NO to keep them. The system HELP files are updated
           in either case.

           Step 7: Choosing the Installation Verification Procedure
           (IVP) options.

           The IVP runs tests to check whether the installation
           procedure was successful. There are two parts to the SCA
           IVP: one that tests the character-cell version of SCA, and
           one that tests the DECwindows version. If you want to run
           the character cell or both parts of the IVP, press Return
           in response the following IVP prompt:

           * Do you want to run the IVP after installation [YES]? <Return>

           Entering YES to this prompt causes the following to
           appear:

           The IVP has two sections, a character cell section and a DECwindows
           section. In order for the DECwindows section to run correctly, the
           logical name DECW$DISPLAY must be appropriately set (using the SET
           DISPLAY command). If at this time you are not prepared to run the
           DECwindows portion of the IVP, enter NO at the following prompt.

           You can rerun the IVP later by issuing the command:

           @SYS$TEST:SCA$IVP

           * Do you wish to run the whole IVP [YES]?

           If you do not want to run the DECwindows part of the IVP
           because, for example, you do not have an appropriate
           display device, enter NO to the previous prompt. It
           is highly recommended that you run the IVP not only
           to verify that the installation succeeded, but also to
           set up a sample SCA library and to have the logical name
           SCA$EXAMPLE refer to that library. The installation places

              the necessary files in the sample directory and the IVP
              creates the sample SCA library in that directory. The IVP
              also sets up an example library for the program design
              facility (PDF), referred to by the logical name SCA$2167A.
              If you choose not to run the IVP, enter NO at the previous
              prompt. You can run the IVP after the installation by
              entering the following command:

              $ @SYS$TEST:SCA$IVP<Return>

           Step 8: Respond to license registration queries.

           SCA supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
           (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
           information about your product and then asks if you have
           registered and loaded your product authorization key (PAK)
           for SCA. The following is an example of such information:

           Product:       LSE
           Producer:      DEC
           Version:       4.3
           Release Date:  dd-mmm-yyyy

           * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

           If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you must
           answer NO to this question. You have to register and
           load your PAK in order to run the IVP. If you have not
           registered the product, the installation may be completed;
           however, Digital recommends you register and load your PAK
           and then restart the installation.

           Step 9: Server Installation

           If you install the SCA server, two accounts are created:
           SCA$SERVER and SCA$DEFAULT.

           The server code itself runs under the SCA$SERVER account.
           This account has no special privileges, but is granted
           access to all SCA library directories by an access control
           list (ACL) that is added when libraries are created. This
           installation also grants READ and EXECUTE access for the
           SCA$SERVER account to the NETPROXY database, which it
           uses to verify remote users' access to SCA libraries
           where the server is running. The image executed by the
           SCA server, SCA$SERVER_MAIN, is installed with SYSPRV and
           SYSNAM privileges.

           This installation defines the SCA$SERVER object in the
           network database. A password for the SCA$SERVER account
           is automatically generated and added to the Network
           Control Program (NCP) database. If you decide to change
           the SCA$SERVER account password in the future, you must
           remember to update the SCA$SERVER object password also by
           using NCP.

     5-10 Installing the Source Code Analyzer

 






              Another account, SCA$DEFAULT, is created by this
              installation to grant access to remote users who do not
              have proxy access to the local node. This account has no
              special privileges.









































                                Installing the Source Code Analyzer 5-11

 






           Both these accounts must have unique User Identification
           Codes (UICs). You are prompted to enter information for
           these accounts as in the following example:

              In order to grant access to remote users who do not have a proxy
              account for the local node, SCA creates the SCA$DEFAULT account,
              which is used as a default proxy account for SCA library access.

              This account has no special privileges.

                 You must specify a unique UIC for this account in order
                 to ensure proper security of your libraries.

              SCA generates a long password for this account that is hard to guess.

           * Enter UIC for SCA$DEFAULT account (include brackets) [[371,345]]:
           %SCA-I-CREACC, Creating account SCA$DEFAULT
           %VMSINSTAL-I-ACCOUNT, This installation creates an ACCOUNT named

           %UAF-I-MDFYMSG, user record(s) updated

              In order to ensure that the SCA server runs with the proper
              quotas, this installation procedure will create an account for the
              server. This account, SCA$SERVER, has no special privileges and
              is set up only for network operation.

              You must specify a unique UIC for this account in order to ensure
              proper security of your libraries. The SCA server account is
              automatically granted access to each library created, via Access
              Control Lists.

           SCA generates a long password for this account that is hard to guess.

           If you want to change the name of this account after the installation
           has completed, you must also change the password in the NCP database
           with the SET OBJECT SCA$SERVER PASSWORD command.

              Step 10: Read the informational messages.

              The SCA installation procedure produces a number of
              informational messages that report on the progress of

           If the server is installed, the installation procedure
           creates or modifies the following files:

           If you chose to run the IVP in step 7, VMSINSTAL now calls
           the IVP to verify that SCA was installed successfully.
           If you answered YES to running the entire IVP, the
           DECwindows portion requires user action. The SCA main
           window appears on the screen. Use the mouse to choose the
           Exit menu option from the File pull-down menu. The IVP
           then continues.

           Additionally, the following files are created by the IVP
           for the SCA and PDF sample libraries:

           o  SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.SCA.EXAMPLE]SCA$EVENT.DAT

           o  SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.SCA.2167A]SCA$EVENT.DAT

           Also, if you typed YES in response to the prompt that
           requests a file purge, previous versions of SCA files are
           now purged.

                 Installation of Source Code Analyzer 4.3 completed at hh:mm

                 VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

              $ LOGOUT <Return>
              SYSTEM     logged out at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ss

              When the product installation procedure is complete, you
              can choose to install more products or to log out (as
              shown here). If you removed any media from the console
              drive before beginning the installation, you should
              replace it now.

              The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in the
              process symbol tables during the installation. Therefore,
              if you are going to continue using the system manager's
              account and you want to restore these symbols, you must
              log out and log in again.

        5.4.1 Installing SCA on a VAXcluster

              If you want to run SCA on multiple nodes of a VAXcluster,
              first check to see that you have the appropriate software
              license. Then, follow these steps after installing SCA:

              1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
                 on each node in the VAXcluster on which SCA is to be
                 executed as described in the
                 OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

              2. Run SYS$STARTUP:SCA$STARTUP.COM on each node of the
                 cluster that has a software license.

                 To ensure that SCA is installed each time the system
                 is bootstrapped, include the following line in
                 SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_V6.COM
                 (the site-specific startup file):

                 @SYS$STARTUP:SCA$STARTUP.COM

           3. To use the product on other nodes in the VAXcluster,
              you must replace the version of the DCL tables that is
              installed on the other VAXcluster nodes. To do this,
              perform the following steps:

              a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

              b. Run INSTALL and enter the following command at the
                 INSTALL> prompt:

                 INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

              c. Repeat steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

                                         Installing the DEC Test Manager



              This chapter explains how to install the DEC Test Manager.

        6.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The DECset Environment Manager is installed as part of the
              installation of the DEC Test Manager component. The DECset
              Environment Manager consists of:

              o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

              o  DCL interface

              o  DECwindows interface

              The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

              The installation of DEC Test Manager, Version 3.6, takes
              approximately 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the type of
              media and your system configuration. Before installing DEC
              Test Manager, you must have the following privileges and
              resources:

              o  SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
                 privileges.

              o  A minimum of 15,000 blocks of free disk space
                 during installation; 10,000 blocks are used after
                 installation.

              o  A minimum of 800 free global pages, plus the size (in
                 number of disk blocks) of the file SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
                 at installation. For most efficient operation, you will
                 need a total of 800 free global pages, plus the size of
                 SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE after installation.

              o  A minimum of 15 free global sections at installation;
                 12 global sections are used after installation.

                                     Installing the DEC Test Manager 6-1

 






           o  The minimum number of OpenVMS classes necessary for
              full functionality as described in the DEC Test Manager
              SPD.


     6.2 User Account Quotas and Privileges

           To use DEC Test Manager, each account must have TMPMBX and
           NETMBX privileges and the following minimum requirements:

           o  AST limit (ASTLM) of 100

           o  Buffered I/O byte count quota (BYTLM) of 60,000

           o  Enqueue quota (ENQLM) of 10

           o  Open file limit (FILLM) of 9

           o  Subprocess creation quota (PRCLM) of 4

              ________________________Note ________________________

              DECwindows testing may require quotas for other
              applications being tested.

              _____________________________________________________

           A minimum required page file quota for using DEC Test
           Manager varies depending upon the application under
           test. If you encounter unexplained exceeded quota errors,
           increase your page file quota. One approach to determine
           an appropriate value is to set the page file quota high
           (90,000 or more) and decrease it until the threshold at
           which the problem occurs is encountered.

           Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
           the current values of these quotas with the requirements
           for DEC Test Manager. For example, the account used in the
           following example is the SYSTEM account:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
           $ RUN AUTHORIZE
           UAF> SHOW SYSTEM

           To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
           Authorize Utility's MODIFY command. For more information,
           see the OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference
           Manual.

     6-2 Installing the DEC Test Manager

 






        6.2.1 Special Requirements

              The executable file SYS$LIBRARY:DECW$TERMINALSHR.EXE must
              be installed with the /OPEN and /SHARE qualifiers. DEC
              Test Manager does this automatically during the startup
              procedure.

        6.3 Installing DEC Test Manager

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Defaults appear in
              brackets throughout the installation procedure.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              then returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
              proceed from step 2.

              Step 1: Log in to a privileged account and set your
              default device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

        <Return>

              Username: SYSTEM <Return>
              Password:          <Return>
              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <Return>

              Step 2: Invoke VMSINSTAL.

              $ @VMSINSTAL DTM03n MUA0: OPTIONS N <Return>

                    OpenVMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.n

              It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? <Return>

              If you are satisfied with the backup of your system disk,
              press Return. Otherwise, enter NO and press the Return key
              to discontinue the installation.


                                     Installing the DEC Test Manager 6-3

 






           Step 3: Insert the first installation kit volume.

           Please mount the first volume of the set on MUA0:.
           * Are you ready? YES <Return>
           The following products will be processed:

             DTM V3.6

               Beginning installation of DTM V3.6 at hh:mm

           %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save-set A...

           To indicate that you want to continue the installation,
           mount volume 1, enter YES, and then press the Return key.

           Step 4: Insert the subsequent installation kit volumes.

           %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _MUA0: for reading

           Enter "YES" when ready: YES <Return>

           The VMSINSTAL procedure prompts you to insert the next
           volume and waits for you to enter YES after inserting it.
           If you enter NO, VMSINSTAL displays the prompt again. This
           prompt is displayed only if your installation kit contains
           more than one volume.

           Step 5: Select a release notes option.

           This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in step
           2.

           Release Notes Options:

               1. Display release notes
               2. Print release notes
               3. Both 1 and 2
               4. Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
               5. Do not display, print, or copy release notes

           * Select option [2]: <Return>

           If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
           notes on line immediately. You can terminate the display
           at any time by pressing Ctrl/C.

     6-4 Installing the DEC Test Manager

 






              If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue
              name. Either enter a queue name or press the Return key to
              send the file to the default output print device.

              * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. You can terminate the display
              at any time by pressing
              Ctrl/C. The VMSINSTAL procedure then prompts you for a
              queue name. Either enter a queue name or press the Return
              key to send the file to the default output print device.
              The DEC Test Manager release notes are then copied to
              SYS$HELP:DTM036.RELEASE_NOTES.

              If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL copies the release notes
              to SYS$HELP immediately.

              If you select option 5, VMSINSTAL does not display, print,
              or copy the release notes, but moves them to SYS$HELP.
              Typically, this option is selected when the user wants to
              end the installation.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The release notes file installed by VMSINSTAL is
                labeled with the current product name and a version
                number (for example, DTM036). Take care not to
                delete release notes for previous versions of DEC
                Test Manager.

                _____________________________________________________

              Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

              * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES <Return>
              %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product release notes have been successfully
                  moved to SYS$HELP.

              If you want to continue the installation, enter YES and
              press the Return key. If you enter NO or press the Return
              key, VMSINSTAL discontinues the installation. In either
              case, VMSINSTAL moves the release notes to SYS$HELP.


                                     Installing the DEC Test Manager 6-5

 






           Step 6: Respond to license registration queries.

           DEC Test Manager supports the OpenVMS License Management
           Facility (LMF). The installation procedure displays
           license information about your product and then asks if
           you have registered and loaded your product authorization
           key (PAK) for DEC Test Manager. The following is an
           example of such information:

           Product:       DTM
           Producer:      DEC
           Version:       3.6
           Release Date:  dd-mmm-yyyy

           * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

           If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you must
           answer NO to this question. You have to register and load
           your PAK to successfully complete the installation. If you
           answer YES to this question and you have not registered
           and loaded the PAK, you are asked if you would like to
           complete the installation without running the Installation
           Verification Procedure (IVP). However, the next time
           you invoke DEC Test Manager you will receive a message
           indicating that you are not licensed to run the product.

           Step 7: Select installation options.

           * Do you want to install the interface components [YES]? YES <Return>
           * Do you also wish to install the DTM DECwindows interface [YES]? YES <Return>
           * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>

           The directories SYS$EXAMPLES, SYS$HELP, SYS$LIBRARY,
           SYS$MANAGER, and SYS$SYSTEM may contain previous versions
           of
           DEC Test Manager files. These files are replaced during
           the installation with new files, but the old files are not
           automatically purged. Purging is recommended. In response
           to the purging prompt, press Return to purge the files or
           enter NO to keep them.

           * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? YES <Return>



     6-6 Installing the DEC Test Manager

 






              The IVP runs tests to verify that the installation
              was successful. If the IVP determines that you have
              insufficient quotas to run the IVP, you are notified as
              to which quotas need to be increased and are then asked
              if you would like to complete the installation without
              running the IVP. Press Return to run the IVP after the
              installation. If you do not want to run the IVP, enter NO
              at the prompt.

              Step 8: Read the informational messages.

              The DEC Test Manager installation procedure produces
              a number of informational messages that report on the
              progress of the installation.

              The success of the installation is indicated by the
              following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target directories...

              If the installation procedure is successful, the new or
              modified files are moved to their target directories.

              The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              files are updated to include the new versions of the DEC
              Test Manager Help text and the DEC Test Manager command-
              line definition.

              If you entered YES in response to the prompt that requests
              a file purge at step 7, previous versions of the DEC Test
              Manager files are now purged.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                When installing DEC Test Manager on OpenVMS VAX
                Version 5.5, the following warning message is
                displayed:

                %DECSET-I-LINKPCDRIVER, Linking PCDRIVER.EXE, ignore no transfer address
                warning.
                %LINK-W-USRTFR, image DKA200:[SYS0.SYSUPD.DECSET120]PCDRIVER.EXE;1 has no
                user transfer address.



                                     Installing the DEC Test Manager 6-7

 






              This warning message can be ignored. It does not
              affect the performance of DEC Test Manager. This
              warning message is not displayed when installing DEC
              Test Manager on OpenVMS VAX Version 6.0 or higher,
              or when installing DEC Test Manager on any version
              of OpenVMS Alpha.

              _____________________________________________________

           Step 9: Observe the installation verification procedure.

           If you chose to run the IVP in step 6, VMSINSTAL calls
           the IVP to verify that DEC Test Manager was installed
           successfully.

           %DTM-I-IVPBEGIN, Begin Installation Verification Procedure
           .
           .
           .
           %DTM-I-IVPEND, End Installation Verification Procedure

           Step 10: End the installation procedure.

              Installation of DEC Test Manager V3.6 completed at hh:mm

              VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

           $ LOGOUT <Return>
           SYSTEM     logged out at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm

           The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in the
           process symbol tables during the installation. Therefore,
           if you are going to continue using the system manager's
           account and you want to restore these symbols, you must
           log out and log in again.

     6.3.1 Installing DEC Test Manager on a VAXcluster

           If you want to run DEC Test Manager on multiple nodes
           of a VAXcluster, first check to see that you have the
           appropriate software license. Then, follow these steps
           after installing DEC Test Manager:

           1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
              on each node in the VAXcluster on which DEC Test
              Manager is to be executed as described in the OpenVMS
              License Management Utility Manual.

     6-8 Installing the DEC Test Manager

 






              2. Run SYS$STARTUP:DTM$STARTUP.COM on each node of the
                 cluster that has a software license.

                 To use the product on other nodes in the VAXcluster,
                 you must replace the version of the DCL tables that is
                 installed on the other VAXcluster nodes. To do this,
                 perform the following steps:

                 a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

                 b. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

                    $ INSTALL REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

                 c. Repeat steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

        6.3.2 Running DEC Test Manager on a Mixed VAXcluster

              Some users may want to run DEC Test Manager, Version 3.6,
              on a mixed VAXcluster that supports various versions of
              OpenVMS software on different nodes. If DEC Test Manager,
              Version 3.6, is to be used for interactive terminal
              testing with a system running OpenVMS, Version 6.0, on
              the VAXcluster, then DEC Test Manager has to be installed

                    Installing the DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer



              This chapter explains how to install the DEC Performance
              and Coverage Analyzer (PCA).

        7.1 Required Operating System Components

              The OpenVMS operating system comes with a variety of
              support options, or classes. Classes include such
              features as networking and Record Management System (RMS)
              journaling. For a complete list of the required classes,
              see the Software Product Description (SPD).

        7.2 Prerequisite Software

              DEC PCA, Version 4.3, requires the OpenVMS VAX operating
              system, Version 5.5 or higher; OpenVMS Alpha operating
              system, Version 1.5 or higher; and DECwindows Motif,
              Version 1.1.

              The OpenVMS DECwindows Compute Server component must
              be installed before PCA is installed. The DECwindows
              compute server consists of the OpenVMS Run-Time Library
              (RTL) images DECW$DWTLIBSHR.EXE, DECW$XLIBSHR.EXE, and
              DECW$TRANSPORT_COMMON.EXE.

        7.3 Optional Software

              You can use the following optional software with DEC PCA
              Version 4.3:

              o  DEC Ada, Version 1.0, or VAX Ada, Version 2.0 or later

           o  DEC SCAN, Version 1.1 or later

           o  DEC Test Manager, Version 3.6

           o  DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer,
              Version 4.3

           All features of PCA are available to each of these
           languages. The DEC Test Manager and the DEC Language-
           Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer can be used in
           conjunction with PCA.

     7.4 Installation Procedure Requirements

           The DECset Environment Manager is installed as part of the
           installation of the PCA component. The DECset Environment
           Manager consists of:

           o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

           o  DCL interface

           o  DECwindows interface

           The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

           The installation takes approximately 5 to 25 minutes,
           depending on the type of media and your system config-
           uration. Before installing DEC PCA, you must have the
           following privileges and resources:

           o  SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
              privileges.

           o  A minimum of 12,000 blocks of free disk space during
              installation; 5,000 blocks are used after installation
              with the demo package.

     7-2 Installing the DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer

 






              o  A minimum of 1,305 free global pages, plus the size (in
                 number of disk blocks) of the file SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
                 at installation. For most efficient operation, you will
                 need a total of 100 free global pages, plus the size of
                 SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE after installation.

              o  A minimum of 10 free global sections at installation.

        7.5 User Account Quotas and Privileges

              To use DEC PCA, it is recommended that each account
              have TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges and the following
              requirements:

              o  AST limit (ASTLM) 30 (minimum)

              o  Buffered I/O byte count quota (BYTLM) 4,096 (minimum)

              o  Open file limit (FILLM) 20 (minimum)

        7.6 Installing DEC PCA

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Defaults appear in
              brackets throughout the installation procedure.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              then returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
              proceed from step 2.

              Step 1: Log in to a privileged account and set your
              default device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

        <Return>

              Username: SYSTEM  <Return>
              Password:         <Return>
              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <Return>

           Step 2: Invoke VMSINSTAL.

           $ @VMSINSTAL PCA043 MUA0: OPTIONS N <Return>

                 OpenVMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.n

           It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
           Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

           * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? <Return>

           If you are satisfied with the backup of your system disk,
           press Return. Otherwise, enter NO and press the Return key
           to discontinue the installation.

           Step 3: Insert the first installation kit volume.

           Please mount the first volume of the set on MUA0:.
           * Are you ready? YES <Return>
           The following products will be processed:

             DEC PCA V4.3

               Beginning installation of DEC PCA V4.3 at hh:mm

           %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save-set A...

           To indicate that you want to continue the installation,
           mount volume 1, enter YES, and press the Return key.

           Step 4: Insert the subsequent installation kit volumes.

           %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _MUA0: for reading

           Enter "YES" when ready: YES<Return>

           The VMSINSTAL procedure prompts you to insert the next
           volume and waits for you to enter YES after inserting it.
           If you enter NO, VMSINSTAL displays the prompt again. This
           prompt is displayed only if your installation kit contains
           more than one volume.

              Step 5: Select a release notes option.

              This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in step
              2.

              Release Notes Options:

                  1. Display release notes
                  2. Print release notes
                  3. Both 1 and 2
                  4. Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
                  5. Do not display, print or copy release notes

              * Select option [3]: <Return>

              If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. You can terminate the display
              at any time by pressing Ctrl/C.

              If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue
              name. Either enter a queue name or press the Return key to
              send the file to the default output print device.

              * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. You can terminate the display
              at any time by pressing Ctrl/C. VMSINSTAL then prompts
              you for a queue name. Either enter a queue name or press
              the Return key to send the file to the default output
              print device. The DEC PCA release notes are then copied to
              SYS$HELP:PCA043.RELEASE_NOTES.

              If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL copies the release notes
              to SYS$HELP immediately.

              If you selected release note option 5, which specified
              that the release notes be copied to SYS$HELP, you will not
              be able to access the release notes without installing the
              product kit again.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                This version of the release notes file installed by
                VMSINSTAL is labeled with the current product name
                and version number. Take care not to delete release
                notes for previous versions of DEC PCA.

                _____________________________________________________

                Installing the DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer 7-5

 








           Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

           * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES <Return>
           %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product release notes have been
                 successfully moved to SYS$HELP.

           If you want to continue the installation, enter YES and
           press the Return key. If you enter NO or press Return,
           VMSINSTAL discontinues the installation. In either case,
           VMSINSTAL moves the release notes to SYS$HELP.

           Step 6: Respond to license registration queries.

           DEC PCA supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
           (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
           information about your product and then asks if you
           have registered and loaded your product authorization
           key (PAK) for DEC PCA. The following is an example of such
           information:

           Product:       PCA
           Producer:      DEC
           Version:       4.3
           Release Date:  dd-mmm-yyyy

           * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

           You must have a PCA license installed and loaded on the
           system. If you do not have a license installed, answer NO.
           The installation of PCA will continue but the Installation
           Verification Procedure (IVP) will not be executed. The IVP
           will be placed on the system. It is recommended that you
           execute the IVP upon completion of installation once you
           have registered and loaded the PCA license. See step 10 on
           how to execute the IVP.

           Step 7: Select installation options.

           The DECset Environment Manager is installed as part of the installation
           of this DECset component.

           The DECset Environment Manager consists of:

           A run-time component used by DECset layered products,
           a DCL interface, and
           a DECwindows interface.

     7-6 Installing the DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer

 






              The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

              * Do you want to install the interface components [YES]? YES <Return>
              * Do you also wish to install the PCA DECwindows collector [YES]? YES <Return>
              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>
              * Do you want to install the PCA demo package [YES]? <Return>

              The directories SYS$EXAMPLES, SYS$HELP, SYS$LIBRARY,
              SYS$MANAGER, and SYS$SYSTEM may contain previous versions
              of DEC PCA files. These files are replaced during the
              installation with new files, but the old files are not
              automatically purged. Purging is recommended. In response
              to the purging prompt, press Return to purge the files or
              enter NO to keep them.

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? <Return>

              The IVP runs tests to check whether the installation
              procedure was successful. Press Return to run the IVP
              after the installation. If you do not want to run the IVP,
              enter NO in response to the prompt.

              Step 8: Install the PCA demo package.

              * Do you want to install the PCA demo package [YES]? YES <Return>
              %VMS-I-SYSDIR, This product creates system directory
                    [SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.PCA]

              The VMSINSTAL procedure asks you if you want to install
              the optional PCA demo package. If you enter YES (the de-
              fault), then the
              SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.PCA] directory is created,
              and all the demo files are copied into it. The system
              logical name PCA$EXAMPLES, pointing to this directory, is
              also defined. After the installation, you will be able to
              run the demos with @PCA$EXAMPLES:PCA_DEMO.

              Step 9: Read the informational messages.

              The DEC PCA installation procedure produces a number of
              informational messages that report on the progress of the
              installation.

              The success of the installation is indicated by the
              following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target
                    directories...

                Installing the DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer 7-7

 






           If the installation procedure is successful, the new or
           modified files are moved to their target directories.

           The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
           files are updated to include the new versions of the DEC
           PCA Help text and the PCA command-line definition.

           This installation will add the following files:

           o  SYS$SYSTEM:PCA$ANALYZER.EXE

           o  SYS$LIBRARY:PCA$COLLECTOR.EXE

           o  SYS$LIBRARY:PCA$OBJ.OBJ

           o  SYS$HELP:PCA043.RELEASE_NOTES

           o  SYS$HELP:PCA$HELP.HLB

           o  DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS:PCAC.UID

           o  DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS:PCAA.UID

           o  SYS$HELP:PCAA_HELP.HLB

           o  SYS$HELP:PCAC_HELP.HLB

           o  SYS$HELP:PCA_COMMANDS.PS

           o  SYS$HELP:PCA_COMMANDS.LINE

           o  SYS$HELP:PCA_COMMAND_REFERENCE.PS

           o  SYS$HELP:PCA_COMMAND_REFERENCE.LINE

           o  SYS$HELP:PCA_MESSAGES.PS

           o  SYS$HELP:PCA_MESSAGES.LINE

           o  SYS$MESSAGE:PCA$MSG.MSG

           o  SYS$STARTUP:PCA$STARTUP.COM

           o  SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST]PCA.DIR

           o  VUE$LIBRARY:*.COM (PCA VUE Files)

           o  SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.PCA]*.*

           o  SYS$TEST:PCA$IVP.COM

           The PCA, Version 4.3, installation optionally adds or
           replaces the
           SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.PCA] directory and its
           contents.

     7-8 Installing the DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer

 






              If you typed YES in response to the prompt that requests
              a file purge at step 7, previous versions of the DEC PCA
              files are now purged.

              Step 10: Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

              If you chose to run the IVP in step 7, VMSINSTAL now calls
              the IVP to verify that PCA was successfully installed.

              If PCA has been successfully installed, the IVP displays
              the following message:

              Running the IVP...

              The IVP ran successfully for PCA Version V4.3

              If you answered NO to the LMF question in step 6, you
              can run the IVP after installation, and after loading and
              registering the PCA license.

              To execute the IVP command procedure, enter the following
              command:

              $ @SYS$TEST:PCA$IVP <Return>

              Step 11: End the installation procedure.

                 Installation of DEC PCA V4.3 completed at hh:mm

                 VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

              $ LOGOUT <Return>
              SYSTEM     logged out at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ss

              When the product installation procedure is complete, you
              can choose to install more products or to log out (as
              shown here). If you removed any media from the console
              drive before beginning the installation, you must replace
              it now.

              The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in the
              process symbol tables during the installation. Therefore,
              if you are going to continue using the system manager's
              account and you want to restore these symbols, you must
              log out and log in again.

     7.6.1 Installing DEC PCA on a VAXcluster

           If you want to run DEC PCA on multiple nodes of a
           VAXcluster, first check to see that you have the
           appropriate software license. Then, follow these steps
           after installing DEC PCA:

           1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
              on each node in the VAXcluster on which DEC PCA is to
              be executed as described in the
              OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

           2. Execute PCA$STARTUP.COM on each node of the cluster
              that has a software license.

           3. To use the product on other nodes in the VAXcluster,
              you must replace the version of the DCL tables that is
              installed on the other VAXcluster nodes. To do this,
              perform the following steps:

              a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

              b. Run INSTALL and enter the following command at the
                 INSTALL> prompt:

                 INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

              c. Repeat steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

     7.7 After the Installation

           DEC PCA is now installed and can be invoked by all users
           with the PCA command.

           The installation procedure modifies the DCL command table
           so that the PCA command is recognized and processed.
           However, the previous command table is still in effect
           for those users who are currently logged in. All logged-in
           users who want to use the PCA command must log out of the
           system and log in again.

           To reinstall PCA at system bootstrap time, modify the
           system-specific startup procedure. Include the following
           line in the SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_V6.COM file:

           @SYS$STARTUP:PCA$STARTUP.COM

     7-10 Installing the DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer

 






              The PCA$STARTUP.COM file contains commands to install
              PCA$COLLECTOR.EXE. The PCA installation procedure puts the
              PCA$STARTUP.COM file in the SYS$STARTUP directory.

                             Installing the DEC Module Management System



              This chapter explains how to install the DEC Module
              Management System (MMS).

        8.1 Prerequisite Software

              MMS, Version 3.0, requires the OpenVMS VAX operating
              system, Version 5.5 or higher; OpenVMS Alpha operating
              system, Version 1.5 or higher; and DECwindows Motif,
              Version 1.1.

              For OpenVMS VAX, Version 5.5 (or higher) systems,
              the following OpenVMS classes are required for full
              functionality of MMS:

              o  OpenVMS required save set

              o  Utilities

              o  Programming support

              For more information on OpenVMS classes and tailoring
              them, see the OpenVMS Operating System Software Product
              Description.

        8.2 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The installation takes approximately 5 to 45 minutes,
              depending on the type of media and your system configura-
              tion. Before installing MMS, you must have the following
              privileges and resources:

              o  SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL and SYSPRV privileges.

              o  A minimum of 2,800 blocks of free disk space during
                 installation; 300 blocks are used after installation.

              o  A minimum of 2 MB of physical memory.

                         Installing the DEC Module Management System 8-1

 






           o  A minimum of 500 free global pages, plus the size (in
              number of disk blocks) of the file SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              at installation.

           o  A minimum of 5 free global sections at installation; 5
              global sections are used after installation.

     8.3 User Account Quotas and Privileges

           To use MMS, each account must have a minimum of TMPMBX
           privilege and have the following minimum requirements:

           o  AST limit (ASTLM) 14 (minimum)

           o  Buffered I/O byte count quota (BYTLM) 13,000 (minimum)

           o  Open file limit (FILLM) 6 (minimum)

           o  Subprocess creation quota (PRCLM) 2 (minimum)

     8.4 Using MMS with Other Tools

           The DECset Environment Manager is installed as part of the
           installation of the MMS component. The DECset Environment
           Manager consists of:

           o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

           o  DCL interface

           o  DECwindows interface

           The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

           MMS includes support for forms in VAX FMS libraries. If
           FMS is not installed on your system, the procedure prints
           the following message:

           %MMS-I-NOFMSSUPP, MMS will not contain support for VAX FMS.

           To use MMS to access forms stored in FMS libraries, you
           must have already installed FMS on your system. If you
           install or reinstall FMS after you have installed MMS, FMS
           support will not be available. You must reinstall MMS for
           FMS support.

     8-2 Installing the DEC Module Management System

 






        8.5 Installing MMS

              This section contains excerpts from the installation pro-
              cedure and
              explains each step. Defaults appear in brackets throughout
              the installation procedure.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              then returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
              proceed from step 2.

              Step 1: Log in to a privileged account and set your
              default device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

        <Return>

              Username: SYSTEM  <Return>
              Password:         <Return>
              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <Return>

              Step 2: Invoke VMSINSTAL.

              $ @VMSINSTAL MMS030 MUA0: OPTIONS N <Return>

                    OpenVMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.n

              It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? <Return>

              If you are satisfied with the backup of your system disk,
              press Return. Otherwise, enter NO and press the Return key
              to discontinue the installation.

              Step 3: Insert the first installation kit volume.

              Please mount the first volume of the set on MUA0:.
              * Are you ready? YES <Return>
              The following products will be processed:

                MMS V3.0

                  Beginning installation of MMS V3.0 at hh:mm

              %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save-set A...

                         Installing the DEC Module Management System 8-3

 






           To indicate that you want to continue the installation,
           mount volume 1, enter YES, and press the Return key.

           Step 4: Insert the subsequent installation kit volumes.

           %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _MUA0: for reading

           Enter "YES" when ready: YES <Return>

           The VMSINSTAL procedure prompts you to insert the next
           volume and waits for you to enter YES after inserting it.
           If you enter NO, VMSINSTAL displays the prompt again. This
           prompt is displayed only if your installation kit contains
           more than one volume.

           Step 5: Select a release notes option.

           This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in step
           2.

           Release Notes Options:

               1. Display release notes
               2. Print release notes
               3. Both 1 and 2
               4. Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
               5. Do not display, print or copy release notes

           * Select option [2]: <Return>

           If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
           notes on line
           immediately. You can terminate the display at any time
           by pressing Ctrl/C.

           If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue
           name. Either enter a queue name or press the Return key to
           send the file to the default output printer.

           * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

           If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
           notes on line
           immediately, and then prompts you for a queue name. Either
           enter a queue
           name or press the Return key to send the file to the
           default output printer. The MMS release notes are then
           copied to SYS$HELP:MMS030.RELEASE_NOTES.

     8-4 Installing the DEC Module Management System

 






              If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL copies the release notes
              to SYS$HELP immediately.

              If you select option 5, VMSINSTAL does not display or
              print the release notes, but copies them to SYS$HELP.
              Typically, you select this option to terminate the
              installation.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The release notes file installed by VMSINSTAL is
                labeled with the current product name and version
                number (for example, MMS030). Take care not to
                delete release notes for previous versions of MMS.

                _____________________________________________________

              Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following:

              * Do you want to continue the installation ? YES <Return>
              %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been successfully
              moved to SYS$HELP.

              If you want to continue the installation, enter YES and
              press Return. If you enter NO or press Return, VMSINSTAL
              discontinues the installation. In either case, VMSINSTAL
              moves the release notes to SYS$HELP.

              Step 6: Respond to license registration queries.

              MMS supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
              (LMF). The
              installation procedure displays license information about
              your product and then asks if you have registered and
              loaded your product authorization key (PAK) for MMS. The
              following is an example of such information:

              Product:       MMS
              Producer:      DEC
              Version:       3.0
              Release Date:  dd-mmm-yyyy

              * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

              You must register and load your PAK to successfully
              complete the installation. If you have not done so, you
              must answer NO to this question. Register and load your
              PAK and then restart the installation.

                         Installing the DEC Module Management System 8-5

 






           Step 7: Select installation options.

           The DECset Environment Manager is installed as part of the installation
           of this DECset component.

           The DECset Environment Manager consists of:

           A run-time component used by DECset layered products,
           a DCL interface, and
           a DECwindows interface.

           The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

           * Do you want to install the interface components [YES]? YES <Return>
           * Do you also wish to install the MMS DECwindows interface [YES]? YES <Return>
           * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>

           The directories SYS$EXAMPLES, SYS$HELP, and SYS$SYSTEM
           may contain previous versions of MMS files. These files
           are replaced during the installation with new files, but
           the old files are not automatically purged. Purging is
           recommended. In response to the purging prompt, press
           Return to purge the files or enter NO to keep them.

           * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? <Return>

           The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs
           tests to check whether the installation procedure
           was successful. Press Return to run the IVP after the
           installation. If you do not want to run the IVP, enter NO
           in response to the prompt.

           Step 8: Read the informational messages.

           The MMS installation procedure produces a number of
           informational messages that report on the progress of
           the installation.

           No further questions will be asked. The MMS installation
           will now continue for approximately 5 to 45 minutes, depending
           on your type of media and your system configuration.

           %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save-set B ...
           %MMS-I-NOFMSSUPP, MMS will not contain support for VAX FMS.
           %MMS-I-LINKIMAGE, Linking V3.0.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              You see the previous message only if VAX FMS is not

     8-6 Installing the DEC Module Management System

 






                installed on your system.

                _____________________________________________________

              The success of the installation is indicated by the
              following message:

        %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories...

              If the installation procedure is successful, the new
              or modified files are moved to their target direc-
              tories. In addition, the SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and
              SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE files are updated to include
              the new versions of MMS help text and the MMS command-line
              definition.

              The following files are created or modified by the
              installation procedure:

                 SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB
                 SYS$HELP:MMS030.RELEASE_NOTES
                 SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
                 SYS$SYSTEM:MMS.EXE
                 SYS$TEST:MMS$IVP.COM
                 [SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.MMS]MMS$DEFAULT_RULES.MMS
                 [SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.MMS]MMS$DEFAULT_SHELL_RULES.MMS

              If you entered YES in response to the prompt that requests
              a file purge at
              step 7, previous versions of the MMS files are now purged.

              Step 9: Run the Installation Verification Procedure.

              If you chose to run the IVP in step 7, VMSINSTAL now calls
              the IVP to verify that MMS was installed successfully, and
              displays the following:

              %MMS-I-BEGINIVP, Beginning V3.0 IVP.
              %MMS-I-ENDIVP, V3.0 IVP SUCCESSFUL.

              Step 10: End the installation procedure.

                 Installation of MMS V3.0 completed at hh:mm

                 VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

              $ LOGOUT <Return>
              SYSTEM     logged out at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ss

                         Installing the DEC Module Management System 8-7

 






           When the product installation procedure is complete, you
           can choose to install more products or to log out (as
           shown here). If you removed any media from the console
           drive before beginning the installation, you must replace
           it now.

           The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in the
           process symbol tables during the installation. Therefore,
           if you are going to continue using the system manager's
           account and you want to restore these symbols, you must
           log out and log in again.

     8.5.1 Installing MMS on a VAXcluster

           To run MMS on multiple nodes of a VAXcluster, first check
           to see that you have the appropriate software license.
           Then, follow these steps after installing MMS:

           1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
              on each node in the VAXcluster on which MMS is to be
              executed as described in the
              OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

           2. Enter the following command on each node in the
              VAXcluster on which MMS is to be executed:

              $ CREATE/DIRECTORY SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYS$HLP.EXAMPLES.MMS] <Return>

           3. To use the product on other nodes in the VAXcluster,
              you must replace the version of the DCL tables that is
              installed on the other VAXcluster nodes. To do this,
              perform the following steps:

              a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

              b. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

                 $ INSTALL REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

              c. Repeat steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

              so that the tool invocation command is recognized and
              processed. However, the previous command table is still
              in effect for those users who are currently logged in.
              All logged-in users who want to use the updated version of
              each tool must log out of the system and log in again.

              You must edit SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM, the site-
              specific startup file, and add the following line:

              @SYS$STARTUP:tool$STARTUP.COM

              The DECset installation procedure puts the startup command
              file for each tool in the SYS$STARTUP directory.

        9.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is usually
              run at installation. If you want to run the IVP separately
              to ensure the integrity of installed files if system
              problems occur, execute the following command procedure:

              $ @SYS$TEST:tool$IVP.COM <Return>

              The IVP creates a temporary subdirectory in your current
              default directory, and places a library for each tool in
              this subdirectory. The IVP then creates two additional
              levels of subdirectories; therefore, your current default
              directory must not be a subdirectory deeper than six
              levels. Additionally, your current default directory must
              not be defined as a directory search list. The temporary
              subdirectory is deleted at the end of the execution of the
              IVP.

     9.2 Error Conditions

           If the installation procedure fails for any reason, the
           following message is displayed:

           %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of [tool] has failed.

           Note that your default directory must not be set as a
           search list.

           If the IVP fails during the installation, the IVP displays
           a message, such as the following:

           %CMS-E-IVPFAILURE, CMS V3.7 IVP failed.

           %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for CMS V3.7 has failed.

           An error during the installation can occur if one or more
           of the following conditions exist:

           o  The operating system version is incorrect.

           o  The prerequisite software version is incorrect.

           o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
              insufficient (see Section 2.3).

           o  Process quotas required by VMSINSTAL are incorrect (see
              Section 1.7).

           o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

           o  The product license was registered incorrectly or not
              registered and loaded.

           For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
           conditions, see the OpenVMS System Messages and Recovery
           Procedures Reference Manual, your processor-specific
           installation/operations guide, or the OpenVMS License
           Management Utility Manual.

           If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
           you must take the appropriate action as described in the
           message. You may need to change a system parameter or
           increase an authorized quota value.

           If the installation fails, you must restart the installa-
           tion procedure from
           step 2 for the installation procedure for each tool. If
           the installation fails due to an IVP failure, contact your
           Digital field service representative.

        9.3 Maintenance Updates

              Digital may periodically issue maintenance updates of
              DECset. Each update consists of an installation kit. You
              must install this kit as described in this document or
              in any documentation that may accompany the maintenance
              update.

              Each time a maintenance update is released, the version
              number changes. For example, if the current version is
              1.0, the version number of the first maintenance update
              will be 1.1. In addition, the maintenance update includes
              new release notes. The release notes describe the changes
              that have been made to each DECset tool since the previous
              release.

              The update release notes are provided on line. You must
              read the release notes before you install any DECset
              tools; they are also accessible at any time after the
              product is installed. For information on reading the
              release notes before installing any DECset tools, follow
              the installation procedure for each tool. To locate the
              release notes after installation, display or print the
              release notes file as described in Section 1.3.

        9.4 Reporting Problems

              If an error occurs while you are using DECset and you
              believe that the error is caused by a problem with one of
              the tools, take one of the following actions:

              o  If you purchased a DECset license within the past 90
                 days and you think the problem is caused by a software
                 error, contact your Digital support representative.

              o  If you have a BASIC or DECsupport Software Agreement,
                 you must call your Customer Support Center. With these
                 services, you receive telephone support that provides
                 high-level advisory and remedial assistance. For
                 more information, contact your local Digital support
                 representative.

              o  If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement,
                 contact your Digital support representative.

       - DECset V12.0 Collective Installation Procedure -

         This is a collective installation procedure for the DECset components.
         This procedure first asks which DECset components to install.  Then it
         checks the system resources required to perform the installation of all
         the components selected.  If there are enough system resources, it will
         perform serial installation for each of the component you have selected.
         If the system resources are not enough for all components, it will inform
         the user about insufficient system resources but continues to install as
         many components as possible.  This will allow user to later install only
         those components which were not installed in the previous attempt.

     ********************************************************************************

              These are the options provided by this collective
              installation procedure:

         space available on your system disk.

     * Would you like to install the unsupported LSE source files [NO]? yes <Return>

         The LSE that is currently installed on your system contains two
         command languages:  the VMSLSE command language, and the PORTABLE
         command language.

         If you would like to continue with the same system-wide default command
         language that you are currently using, you should accept the default
         answer provided to you at the prompt below.

         If you would like to have the new PORTABLE command language as your
         system-wide default command language, you should specify the PORTABLE
         language.

         If you would like to have a system-wide default command language that
         is compatible with the command language available in versions of LSE
         prior to V4.0, you should specify the VMSLSE language.

         Individual users may override the system default command language.

     A-6 Sample Installation Procedure

 






        * Does this product have one of these authorization keys registered and loaded? yes <Return>

                As well as verifying that the installation succeeded, the IVP also
                creates the SCA example library.  It is therefore recommended that
                you run the IVP.

        * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? <Return>

         The IVP has two sections, a character-cell section and a DECwindows
         section.  In order for the DECwindows section to run correctly, the
         logical name DECW$DISPLAY must be appropriately set (using the SET
         DISPLAY command).  If at this time you are not prepared to run the
         DECwindows portion of the IVP, enter NO at the following prompt.

         You can rerun the IVP later by entering the command:

         @SYS$TEST:SCA$IVP

        * Do you wish to run the whole IVP [YES]? no <Return>
        * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>

         Please indicate the components of SCA that you wish to install:

             1 - Both SCA client and server
             2 - SCA client only

        * Enter the number corresponding to the SCA components to install [1]: <Return>
