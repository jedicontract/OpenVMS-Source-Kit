                              Preparing to Install the DECset Components



              This chapter describes the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing the components of the Compaq
              DECset for OpenVMS software. Your bill of materials
              (BOM) specifies the number and contents of your media.
              Be sure to check the contents of your kit against this
              information. If your kit is damaged or if you find that
              parts of it are missing, call your Compaq representative.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                DECset provides online release notes. Compaq
                strongly recommends that you read the release
                notes before proceeding with the installation. For
                information on accessing these release notes, see
                Section 1.3. When installing a product update, read
                the Read Before Installing or Using Compaq DECset
                for OpenVMS Version n.nn letter before you begin.

                _____________________________________________________

        1.1 Required Operating System and Prerequisite Hardware and
            Software

              The Compaq DECset for OpenVMS, Version 12.4 software
              requires Compaq OpenVMS Operating System, Version 6.2,
              7.1, or 7.2 (7.2-1 for Alpha systems) software.

              For a complete list of the required operating system com-
              ponents, current hardware requirements, and prerequisite
              and optional software and their required version numbers,
              see the Software Product Description (SPD).

     1.2 License Registration

           The OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF) is
           available on the OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX operating
           systems. Before you install any DECset components, you
           must register your component software licenses, or an
           equivalent license such as the DECset software license.

           The license registration information you need is contained
           in the Product Authorization Key (PAK) that is shipped
           with each component. The PAK is a paper certificate that
           contains information about the license.

           During the installation, you are asked if you have reg-
           istered the component license and loaded the appropriate
           authorization key. You must register and load your license
           before you start the installation in order to run the
           Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and use the
           software.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              DECset components can be licensed individually, or a
              single license can encompass all components. The IVP
              requires that the applicable license be loaded.

              _____________________________________________________

           To register a license under OpenVMS, first log in to the
           system manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice
           of two ways to perform the registration:

           o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When
              it prompts you for information, respond with data from
              your PAK.

           o  Enter the DCL command LICENSE REGISTER with the
              appropriate qualifiers that correspond to information
              on the PAK. Next, enter the LICENSE LOAD command with
              the appropriate qualifiers.

           For complete information on using the LMF, see the OpenVMS
           License Management Utility Manual.

        1.3 Accessing Online Documentation

              Each DECset media kit includes online release notes
              for each component application as well as a journal
              of technical notes entitled, the Compaq DECset for
              OpenVMS Cookbook for an Integrated Product Development
              Environment. The prompts to display or print this material
              during the installation is described in Section 2.5 and
              Section 2.6.

              To access this documentation, print the ASCII text files
              shown in Table 1-1.

              Online help also provides a pointer to the release notes
              file. After the installation, enter the following command
              line:

              $ HELP component RELEASE_NOTES <Return>

              In the previous command line, component represents the
              DECset component for which you want help.

              $ HELP DECset RELEASE_NOTES <Return>

              In the previous command line, DECset represents both
              DECset and the Environment Manager. The system displays a
              pointer to the release notes for each one.

        1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements

              This section describes various requirements for installing
              the DECset software on OpenVMS systems.

              If done individually, the installation of each component
              takes approximately 1 to 10 minutes, depending on the type
              of media, your system configuration, and whether you are
              performing a product upgrade or a new installation.



























                          Preparing to Install the DECset Components 1-5

 






     1.4.1 Privileges

           Before installing any DECset component, you must be logged
           into an account that has SETPRV, or at least the following
           privileges:

           o  CMKRNL

           o  WORLD

           o  SYSPRV

           Note that VMSINSTAL turns off BYPASS privilege at the
           start of the installation.

     1.4.2 System Parameters and Disk Space

           Table 1-2 and Table 1-3 list the following system
           resources for each DECset component you are installing:

           o  The minimum amount of free disk space during and after
              installation

           o  The minimum number of free global pagelets plus
              the size (in number of disk blocks) of the file
              SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE at installation

           o  The minimum number of free global sections at
              installation

           These resources reflect the amount of space needed
           when installing all the options for each component. If
           some options are not installed, such as the DECwindows
           interface, the actual amount of space required will be
           reduced.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              You must ensure that your system has the necessary
              global pagelet (or page) and global section SYSGEN
              quotas for the installation. Failure to do so
              could cause the DCL tables to be corrupted in some
              situations.

              If VMSINSTAL detects any of these conditions, you will
              be asked whether you want to continue the installation.
              If you want to continue, type YES. If you want to stop
              the installation, press Return. See Section 2.5 for more
              details.

        1.4.4 Backing Up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if
              you have backed up your system disk. Compaq recommends
              that you do a system backup before installing any
              software.

              Use the backup procedures established at your site. For
              details on performing a system disk backup, see the
              section on the OpenVMS Backup Utility in the OpenVMS
              System Manager's Manual.

        1.5 User Account Quotas and Privileges

              To use any DECset component, each account must meet
              minimum requirements for each of the following areas:

              o  AST limit (ASTLM)

              o  Buffered I/O byte count quota (BYTLM)

              o  Enqueue quota (ENQLM)

              o  Open file limit (FILLM)

              o  Timer queue entry limit (TQELM)

              o  Buffered I/O limit (BIOLM)

              o  Direct I/O limit (DIOLM)

              o  Subprocess limit (PRCLM)

              o  Working set default (WSDEF)

              o  Pagefile quota (PGFLQUOTA)

              o  Process privileges (TMPMBX and NETMBX)

              Table 1-4 and Table 1-5 list specific requirements in
              each of these areas for each DECset component you are
              installing. Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE)
              to compare the current values of these quotas with the

                          Preparing to Install the DECset Components 1-9

 






           requirements for each component. The account used in the
           following example is the SYSTEM account:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
           $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
           UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

           To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
           Authorize Utility MODIFY command. For example:

           UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM /ASTLM=100 <Return>

           For more information, see the OpenVMS System Management
           Utilities Reference Manual.

           Table 1-4 lists the DECset account quotas for OpenVMS
           Alpha systems.

        1.6 Standard System Maintenance Procedures

              The following sections show how to do various standard
              procedures:

              o  Check UAF parameters.

              o  Calculate values for the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS
                 system parameters.

              o  Change parameter values with the AUTOGEN command
                 procedure.

                         Preparing to Install the DECset Components 1-11

 






     1.6.1 Checking UAF Parameters

           Before you install DECset, you should check whether your
           account has sufficient quotas to perform the installation.
           You can check the quotas by entering the following command
           at the DCL prompt to invoke the AUTHORIZE utility:

           $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE <Return>
           UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

           After checking your quotas, enter the EXIT command at the
           UAF> prompt to return to DCL level.

     1.6.2 Calculating the Values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS

           To install and run DECset, you must have sufficient shared
           memory space available. This memory space is expressed
           in terms of free global sections and free global pagelets
           (Alpha systems) or global pages (VAX systems). Each global
           section defines an area of virtual memory for shared
           use, and each global pagelet/page represents a set of
           contiguous-byte locations within a global section that is
           used for memory mapping and management.

           In order to determine whether there is adequate available
           memory, you must first find out how many free global
           pagelets/pages and global sections you have on your
           system. You can then use AUTOGEN if you need to increase
           the GBLSECTIONS or GBLPAGES system parameters.

           To determine the number of available global pagelets
           /pages and global sections on your system, invoke the
           OpenVMS Install Utility (INSTALL), and enter the following
           command:

           $ INSTALL LIST/GLOBAL/SUMMARY <Return>

                   Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

           393 Global Sections Used,  59856/33244 Global Pages Used/Unused

           When you enter this command, the system displays a summary
           of the number of global sections used, the number of
           global pagelets/pages used, and the number of global
           pagelets/pages available.






     1-12 Preparing to Install the DECset Components

 






              You can then determine the number of available global
              sections by invoking SYSGEN, and entering the following
              commands:

       $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN <Return>
       SYSGEN> USE CURRENT <Return>
       SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS <Return>
       Parameter Name   Current   Default   Minimum   Maximum   Unit   Dynamic
       --------------   -------   -------   -------   --------  ----   -------
       GBLSECTIONS          512       250        60       4095  Sections
       SYSGEN> EXIT <Return>

              The first number displayed is the current number of global
              sections. Compare this to the number of global sections in
              use, as displayed by INSTALL. For example, CMS requires
              10 global sections. Therefore, if the number of global
              sections used (displayed by INSTALL) plus 10 exceeds the
              current number of global sections, you must increase the
              number of available global sections before you can install
              CMS.

              If the values the system displays are greater than the
              values listed in Table 1-2 and Table 1-3, you do not
              need to increase the values for these parameters. If the
              value of free global pagelets/pages and global sections is
              less than the value in Table 1-2 and Table 1-3, you must
              increase the system parameter settings.

              Section 1.6.3 describes the procedures for increasing
              these values using AUTOGEN.

        1.6.3 Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN

              Use the AUTOGEN command procedure to change system
              parameters. AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for
              parameters associated with the values you reset manually.
              To change system parameters with AUTOGEN, edit the
              following file:

              SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

              To add a new parameter, add a line to the file that
              includes both the name of the parameter and its value,
              as follows:

              WSMAX = 1024





                         Preparing to Install the DECset Components 1-13

 






           To modify incremental parameters such as GBLPAGES and
           GBLSECTIONS, use ADD_. The following example increases the
           global pagelet/page setting by 2000:

           ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000

           When you set the page file quota, do not use a value that
           exceeds the amount of page file space available on the
           system.

           After you make all your changes, exit from the editor and
           execute the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
           parameters. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT<Return>

           When you specify REBOOT, AUTOGEN performs an automatic
           system shutdown and then reboots the system. Any users
           logged on to the system are immediately disconnected
           during the shutdown. The automatic reboot puts the new
           parameter values into effect.

           For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the OpenVMS
           System Manager's Manual.

                                               Installing the DECset Kit



              The purpose of the DECset installation procedure is two-
              fold: to provide the installer a single point of entry for
              installing any or all DECset components, and to minimize
              the need for user interaction during installation.

              This collective procedure acts as a parent KITINSTAL
              procedure to the individual component installations. The
              procedure spawns off one subprocess per DECset component
              with default instructions on how to install the respective
              component.

              The DECset installation procedure does the following:

              o  Queries for which components to install

              o  Checks system resources required to perform serial
                 installations of the components

              o  Queries for responses to the questions asked as each
                 component is installed

              o  Installs each of the selected DECset components

              This chapter describes the preliminary installation
              steps performed for whatever installation you are
              planning. Whether you are performing a complete DECset
              installation, or any combination of components, these
              steps are completed first. The following chapters describe
              the subsequent installation steps for each of the DECset
              components.











                                           Installing the DECset Kit 2-1

 






     2.1 Prerequisite Software

           DECset requires a valid OpenVMS operating system
           configuration. If you plan to use the DECwindows interface
           for any component, you must also have Compaq DECwindows
           Motif for OpenVMS software installed on your system.

           For a complete list of versions of these products
           compatible with this version of DECset, refer to the
           Software Product Description (SPD).









































     2-2 Installing the DECset Kit

 






        2.2 Accessing the Online Release Notes

              When you invoke VMSINSTAL by specifying DECSETnnn, DECset
              copies online release notes for all the components to
              the SYS$HELP directory. If you invoke VMSINSTAL with the
              OPTIONS N parameter, DECset prompts you to display and
              print the release notes before installation begins. See
              Step 4 of Section 2.6.

              To obtain the release notes after the installation, print
              the following file, which serves as a pointer to the
              separate component files:

              $ PRINT SYS$HELP:DECSET124.RELEASE_NOTES

              This file identifies the files containing release notes
              for individual components (see Section 1.3 for a listing).

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Compaq recommends that you read the release notes
                before continuing with the installation.

                _____________________________________________________

        2.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

              Minimum free disk space, global pages, and global section
              requirements will depend on which components you choose to
              install through the collective procedure.

              The DECset requirements for free disk storage space are
              different during installation and after installation.
              Table 2-1 lists the storage requirements.

              Table 2-1 Disk Space Storage Requirements

                                           Installing the DECset Kit 2-3

 






              ________________________Note ________________________

              On systems with limited disk space, install two
              or three DECset components, then repeat the
              installation procedure until you have installed
              the entire kit. If you have all or part of DECset
              already installed, your space requirements will
              be less. See Chapter 1 for individual component
              installation requirements to calculate totals for
              system resource needs.

              _____________________________________________________

           In most cases, installation can be direct from the
           distribution media. If you need to copy the distribution
           kit onto disk, see Table 2-1 to determine how many free
           blocks you will need for the disk where you plan to copy
           the kit.

           To install DECset, you must be logged in to an account
           that has the SETPRV privilege, or the following privi-
           leges:

           o  CMKRNL

           o  WORLD

           o  SYSPRV

           Note that VMSINSTAL turns off BYPASS privileges at the
           start of installation.

     2.4 Backing Up Your System Disk

           At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if
           you have backed up your system disk. Compaq recommends
           that you do a system backup before installing any
           software.

           Use the backup procedures established at your site. For
           details on performing a system disk backup, see the
           section on the OpenVMS Backup Utility in the OpenVMS
           System Manager's Manual.








     2-4 Installing the DECset Kit

 






        2.5 Using VMSINSTAL

              After you log in to a privileged account to install
              DECset, set the default directory to SYS$UPDATE. Next,
              invoke the VMSINSTAL command procedure to install this
              product. An example of this procedure is shown in Steps 1
              and 2 of Section 2.6.

              The VMSINSTAL command procedure has the following syntax:

              @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name 
               [option-list]

              VMSINSTAL is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. The elements
              that make up the VMSINSTAL command line are the VMSINSTAL
              command, saveset-name, device-name, and option-list. The
              elements that follow the command are defined as follows:

              saveset-name
              The installation name for the component. For DECset, use
              the following installation name:

              DECSETnnn

              The nnn represents the release number (such as DECSET124
              for Version 12.4).

              To obtain the directory location of the DECset save sets
              on the CD, refer to the OpenVMS Software Product Library
              Master Index that accompanies the CD distribution kit.

              Another method is to complete these steps before starting
              installation:

              1. Enter the following command to determine whether the CD
                 drive is already mounted:

                 $ SHOW DEVICE DKA400:

              2. If it is not mounted, enter the appropriate MOUNT
                 command to mount the CD (omit the /FOREIGN qualifier).

              3. To obtain the name of the save set, use a DIRECTORY
                 command specifying the directory file from the previous
                 command:

                 $ DIRECTORY DKA300:[DECSET124...]*.A

           device-name
           The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
           media and the directory containing the DECset save set.
           For example, DKA300: is the device name used in examples
           in this guide. The directory is [DECSETnnn], where nnn is
           the DECset release number.

           To specify the device name on the @VMSINSTAL command line,
           you might enter the following command:

           DKA300:[DECSET124.KIT]

           option-list
           The word OPTIONS followed by one or more of the option
           designators A, G, L, N, and R, as shown in Table 2-2. By
           default, none of these optional distribution, logging,
           or installation functions are activated unless the
           designators are specified with the OPTIONS key.

           If you omit either the product name or device name,
           VMSINSTAL prompts you for them later in the installation
           procedure.

           When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

           o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account.
              Compaq recommends that you install software from the
              system manager account with your default device and
              directory set to SYS$UPDATE.

           o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
              The VMSINSTAL procedure checks for the following quota
              values, for both OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX:

                  ASTLM           18

                  BIOLM           20

                     WSEXTENT     3,600

                 The VMSINSTAL procedure then determines whether the
                 following conditions exist. If so, discontinue the
                 conditions before resuming the installation procedure.

                 -  Whether DECnet is up and running

                 -  Whether any users are logged in to the system

                 If VMSINSTAL detects either of these conditions,
                 the procedure asks whether you want to continue the
                 installation. If you want to continue, enter YES
                 and press the Return key. If you want to stop the
                 installation, press Return. For example, you might
                 accept the default as follows:

                 %VMSINSTAL_W_ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
                       DECW$SERVER_0

        2.6 Installing DECset

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Default values appear in
              brackets ([])  throughout the installation procedure. When
              you accept a default value or enter another selection,
              press Return to advance. You can obtain help information
              on any question by responding with a question mark (?).

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Whether you are installing one, several, or all
                DECset components, the installation process always
                starts with these steps. For details on the balance
                of the installation, see the chapters for the
                individual components you have selected. Other
                details can include language support, installation
                options, and so forth.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all the files it has created up to that point
              and returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must proceed from
              Step 2.

              1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
                 device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

                    a component's release notes at any time, press Ctrl
                    /C.

                 o  Option 2 (the default)-VMSINSTAL prompts you for a
                    queue name. You can then enter a queue name or press
                    the Return key, which sends the file to the default
                    output print device.

                    * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

                 o  Option 3-VMSINSTAL displays the release notes
                    online immediately. To terminate the display of a
                    component's release notes at any time, press Ctrl/C.
                    The VMSINSTAL procedure prompts you for a queue name
                    for printing the release notes. Either enter a queue
                    name or press the Return key to send the file to
                    the default output print device. The DECset release
                    notes are then copied to the SYS$HELP directory.

                 o  Option 4-VMSINSTAL does not display or print the
                    release notes at this time. However, the release
                    notes are always copied to SYS$HELP, for future
                    use.

                 Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

                 * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]?: YES <Return>
                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been 
                  moved to SYS$HELP.

                 If you want to continue the installation, enter YES
                 and press the Return key. If you enter NO (or press
                 Return), VMSINSTAL discontinues the installation.
                 In either case, VMSINSTAL moves the release notes to
                 SYS$HELP.

                 The DECset Environment Manager (ENVMGR) comprises:

                      . A run-time component used by DECset layered products,
                      . A DCL interface, and
                      . A DECwindows interface.

                 The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

              * Do you want to install the interface components [YES]?

              Answer YES if you want DECset to install both the DCL
              and DECwindows interfaces for the ENVMGR component.

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) procedure

              YES to have VMSINSTAL perform the IVP automatically
              at the end of the installation procedure. If you
              choose NO, you can still run the IVP manually after
              the installation is complete.

              %DECSET-I-DONEASK, You have answered all the questions for 
              DECset ENVMGR installation.

        2.7 Installing the DECset Components

              After the Environment Manager installation is complete,
              the DECset installation procedure continues for the
              selected components. Details and examples for each DECset
              component can be found in the following chapters, such as
              Chapter 3, Installing the Compaq Code Management System
              for OpenVMS.

              The steps that follow are performed in order on each of
              the components for which you are licensed, whether you
              are installing the entire DECset product or just a few
              components. The installation performs the following steps:

              1. Prompts you for installation information for each
                 component you selected

              2. Performs the installation of each component

              3. Performs the IVP for each component

              4. Displays a summary of the IVP results for the selected
                 components

              See Appendix A for an example of an upgrade to DECset and
              all its components.

                Installing the Compaq Code Management System for OpenVMS



              This chapter gives specific instructions on installing the
              Compaq Code Management System for OpenVMS (CMS) software.

              The first two sections present installation and user ac-
              count requirements. Section 3.3 continues the installation
              process from where it left off in Section 2.6. Finally,
              the chapter describes how to run CMS on multiple nodes of
              an OpenVMS Cluster. This structure is used for each of the
              component chapters, except when a component has specific
              requirements not common to the other components.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                CMS release notes, up to and including this version,
                can be found in SYS$HELP:CMSnnn.RELEASE_NOTES (where
                nnn is the version and update number, such as 041

        3.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The Compaq DECset Environment Manager for OpenVMS (ENVMGR)
              is installed as part of the installation of the CMS
              component. ENVMGR
              consists of the following:

              o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

              o  DCL interface

              o  DECwindows interface

              The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

           If DTM is to be used with CMS, DTM requires the CMS files
           SYS$SHARE:CMSSHR.EXE and CMSPROSHR.EXE. Be aware that
           whenever you install or reinstall CMS (for example, as
           the result of an incorrect installation or upgrading to
           a higher version of CMS, you will also need to reinstall
           DTM.

           The CMS installation takes approximately 2 to 6 minutes,
           depending on the type of media, your system configuration,
           and whether you are performing a product upgrade or a new
           installation. Before installing CMS, you must have SETPRV
           privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV privileges. In
           addition, you must have the available resources specified
           in Table 3-1.

              $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

              To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
              Authorize Utility MODIFY command. For example:

              UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM /ASTLM=100 <Return>

              For more information, see the OpenVMS System Management
              Utilities Reference Manual.

     3.3 Installing CMS

           This section contains excerpts from the installation
           procedure and explains each step. Default values appear in
           brackets throughout the installation procedure.

           The following steps are performed as part of any DECset
           installation, and are accomplished before the subsequent
           component-specific steps described in this chapter:

           1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
              device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

           2. Invoke VMSINSTAL with a kit on CD-ROM.

           3. Confirm system backup.

           4. Select a release notes option.

           5. Select components to install.

           6. Install the ENVMGR component.

           See Section 2.6 for full descriptions of these universal,
           preliminary installation steps.

           To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
           Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
           deletes all files it has created up to that point and
           returns you to DCL level. To retry the installation
           procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, proceed from Step 2 in
           Section 2.6.

           7. Start the CMS installation.

              %DECSET-I-START_CMS, The following questions relate to CMS
              installation.
              * Do you want to install the CMS DECwindows interface [YES]? 
              <Return>

              Answer YES if you want DECset to install interface.

              If you are installing CMS on an Alpha system running
              OpenVMS Version 7.2 or later, you are asked if you want
              to install support for the Extended File Specifications
              feature.




     3-4 Installing the Compaq Code Management System for OpenVMS

 






                 On OpenVMS Alpha, CMS can support element names using Extended
                 File Specifications. The option exists to install CMS with or
                 without support for Extended File Specifications.

                 * Install Extended File Specifications support [YES]? <Return>

                 Answer YES if you want CMS to install the Extended File
                 Specifications support.

           8. Respond to license registration queries.

              CMS supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
              (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
              information about your product and then asks if you
              have registered and loaded your product authorization
              key (PAK) for CMS. The following is an example of such
              information:

              Product:       VAXSET
              Producer:      DEC
              Version:       12.4

              Product:       CMS
              Producer:      DEC
              Version:       4.1

              * Is one of these authorization keys registered and 
              loaded [YES]? <Return>

              If you have not registered and loaded your PAK,
              answer NO to this question. You must then stop the
              installation, register and load your PAK, then restart
              the installation.

              If you incorrectly answer YES, DECset enables you
              to complete the installation without running the
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP). However,
              when you try to invoke CMS, you will receive a message
              indicating that you are not licensed to run the
              product.

           9. Select installation options.

              You are then asked the following question:

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? 
              <Return>

              The IVP runs tests to verify that the installation
              procedure was successful. Press Return to run the
              IVP after the installation. If you do not want to
              run the IVP, enter NO in response to the prompt. If
              the installation procedure determines that you have
              insufficient quotas to run the IVP, it tells you which
              quotas need to be increased and asks if you would like
              to complete the installation without running the IVP.
              For more IVP information, see Section 9.3.

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation 
                 [YES]?<Return>

                 The directories SYS$HELP, SYS$MANAGER, SYS$MESSAGE,
                 SYS$SHARE, SYS$SYSTEM, SYS$STARTUP, and SYS$TEST might
                 contain previous versions of CMS files. These files are
                 replaced during the installation with new files, but
                 the old files are not automatically purged. Purging is
                 recommended. In response to the purging prompt, press
                 Return to purge the files, or enter NO to keep them.

              10.Read the informational messages.

                 The CMS installation procedure produces a number of
                 informational messages that report on the progress
                 of the installation. The success of this part of the
                 installation is indicated by the following message:

                 %DECSET-I-DONEASK, You have answered all the questions for 
                 CMS installation

                 If CMS installation is successful, new or mod-
                 ified files are moved to their target directo-
                 ries. In addition, the SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and
                 SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE files are updated to include
                 the new versions of the CMS help text and the CMS
                 command-line definition.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                For a list of the CMS files installed (or modified)
                on your system, see Appendix B.

                _____________________________________________________

                 If you entered YES in response to the prompt that
                 requests a file purge in Step 7, previous versions
                 of the CMS files are now purged.

              11.Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

                 If you chose to run the IVP in Step 8, VMSINSTAL calls
                 the IVP to verify that CMS was successfully installed:

              When the product installation procedure is complete,
              you can choose to install more products or log out.
              If you removed any media from the console drive before
              beginning the installation, you must replace it now.

              The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in
              the process symbol tables during the installation.
              Therefore, if you are going to continue using the
              system manager's account and you want to restore these
              symbols, you must log out and log in again.

        3.4 Installing CMS on an OpenVMS Cluster

              If you want to run CMS on multiple nodes of an OpenVMS
              Cluster, first check to see that you have the appropriate
              software license. Then, follow these steps after
              installing CMS:

              1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
                 on each node in the OpenVMS Cluster on which CMS is
                 to be executed, as described in the OpenVMS License
                 Management Utility Manual.

              2. Run SYS$STARTUP:CMS$STARTUP.COM on each node of the
                 cluster that has a software license. In addition, you
                 must add the following line to your system startup
                 procedure, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:CMS$STARTUP.COM

                 To use the product on other nodes in the OpenVMS
                 Cluster, you must replace the version of the DCL tables
                 installed on the other OpenVMS Cluster nodes. To do
                 this, perform the following steps:

                 a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

                 b. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

                    $ INSTALL REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

                 c. Repeat Steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

              See Chapter 9 for information on post-installation
              procedures.

                  Installing the Compaq Digital Test Manager for OpenVMS



              This chapter explains how to install the Compaq Digital
              Test Manager for OpenVMS (DTM) software.

              The first two sections present installation and user ac-
              count requirements. Section 4.3 continues the installation
              process from where it left off in Section 2.6. Finally,
              the chapter describes how to run DTM on multiple nodes of
              an OpenVMS Cluster. This structure is used for each of the
              component chapters, except when a component has specific
              requirements not common to the other components.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                DTM release notes, up to and including this version,
                can be found in SYS$HELP:DTMnnn.RELEASE_NOTES (where
                nnn is the version and update number, such as 040
                for Version 4.0).

                _____________________________________________________

        4.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The Compaq DECset Environment Manager for OpenVMS (ENVMGR)
              is installed as part of the installation of the DTM
              component. ENVMGR
              consists of the following:

              o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

              o  DCL interface

              o  DECwindows interface

              The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.







              Installing the Compaq Digital Test Manager for OpenVMS 4-1

 






           If DTM is to be used with CMS, DTM requires the CMS files
           SYS$SHARE:CMSSHR.EXE and CMSPROSHR.EXE. Be aware that
           whenever you install or reinstall CMS (for example, as
           the result of an incorrect installation or upgrading to a
           higher version of CMS), you will also need to reinstall
           DTM.

           The installation of DTM takes approximately 1 to 3
           minutes, depending on the type of media, your system
           configuration, and whether you are performing a product
           upgrade or a new installation. Before installing DTM, you
           must have SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
           privileges. In addition, you must have the available
           resources specified in Table 4-1.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                DECwindows testing might require quotas for other
                applications being tested.
                _____________________________________________________

              A minimum required page file quota for using DTM varies
              depending on the application under test. If you encounter
              unexplained exceeded quota errors, increase your page file
              quota. One approach to determine an appropriate value is
              to observe the resources consumed at peak system usage.
              Then set the page file quota to a value somewhat beyond
              that required at peak usage.

              Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
              the current values of these quotas with the requirements
              for DTM. For example, the account used in the following
              example is the SYSTEM account:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE
              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM

              To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
              Authorize Utility MODIFY command. For example:

              UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM /ASTLM=100 <Return>

     4.3 Installing DTM

           This section contains excerpts from the installation
           procedure and explains each step. Default values appear in
           brackets throughout the installation procedure.

           The following steps are performed as part of any DECset
           installation, and are accomplished before the subsequent
           component-specific steps described in this chapter:

           1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
              device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

           2. Invoke VMSINSTAL with a kit on CD-ROM.

           3. Confirm system backup.

           4. Select a release notes option.






























     4-4 Installing the Compaq Digital Test Manager for OpenVMS

 






              5. Select components to install.

              6. Install the ENVMGR component.

              See Section 2.6 for full descriptions of these universal,
              preliminary installation steps.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
              proceed from Step 2.

              7. Respond to license registration queries.

                 DTM supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
                 (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
                 information about your product and then asks if you
                 have registered and loaded your product authorization
                 key (PAK) for DTM. The following is an example of such
                 information:

                 Product:       VAXSET
                 Producer:      DEC
                 Version:       12.4

                 Product:       DTM
                 Producer:      DEC
                 Version:       4.0

                 * Is one of these authorization keys registered and loaded? 
                 [YES]? <Return>

                 If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, answer
                 NO to this question. You must register and load your
                 PAK to successfully complete the installation.

                 If you incorrectly answer YES, DECset enables you
                 to complete the installation without running the
                 Installation Verification Procedure (IVP). However,
                 when you try to invoke DTM, you will receive a message
                 indicating that you are not licensed to run the
                 product.

              8. Select installation options.





              Installing the Compaq Digital Test Manager for OpenVMS 4-5

 






              You are then asked the following question:

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? 
              <Return>

              The IVP runs tests to verify that the installation
              was successful. If the IVP determines that you have
              insufficient quotas to run the IVP, it tells you which
              quotas need to be increased and asks if you would like
              to complete the installation without running the IVP.
              Press Return to run the IVP after the installation. If
              you do not want to run the IVP, enter NO at the prompt.

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation 
              [YES]? <Return>

              The directories SYS$EXAMPLES, SYS$HELP, SYS$LIBRARY,
              SYS$MANAGER, and SYS$SYSTEM might contain previous
              versions of DTM files. These files are replaced during
              the installation with new files, but the old files are
              not automatically purged. Purging is recommended. In
              response to the purging prompt, press Return to purge
              the files or enter NO to keep them.

           9. Read the informational messages.

              The DTM installation procedure produces a number of
              informational messages that report on the progress
              of the installation. The success of this part of the
              installation is indicated by the following message:

              %DECSET-I-DONEASK, You have answered all the questions for 
              Digital Test Manager installation

              If the installation procedure is successful, the new or
              modified files are moved to their target directories.

              The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              files are updated to include the new versions of the
              DTM Help text and the DTM command-line definition.

              If you entered YES in response to the prompt that
              requests a file purge at Step 7, previous versions
              of the DTM files are now purged.

           10.Observe the installation verification procedure.

              If you chose to run the IVP in Step 8, VMSINSTAL calls
              the IVP to verify that DTM was installed successfully:

              11.End the installation procedure.

                 If you selected only the DTM installation, the
                 VMSINSTAL procedure ends at the same time, as follows:

                    Installation of DTM V4.0 completed at 15:49

                    VMSINSTAL procedure done at 15:49

                 When the product installation procedure is complete,
                 you can choose to install more products or log out.
                 If you removed any media from the console drive before
                 beginning the installation, you must replace it now.

                 The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in
                 the process symbol tables during the installation.
                 Therefore, if you are going to continue using the
                 system manager's account and you want to restore these
                 symbols, you must log out and log in again.

        4.4 Installing DTM on an OpenVMS Cluster

              If you want to run DTM on multiple nodes of an OpenVMS
              Cluster, first check to see that you have the appropriate
              software license. Then, follow these steps after
              installing DTM:

              1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
                 on each node in the OpenVMS Cluster on which DTM is
                 to be executed, as described in the OpenVMS License
                 Management Utility Manual.

              2. Run SYS$STARTUP:DTM$STARTUP.COM on each node of the
                 cluster that has a software license. In addition, you
                 must add the following line to your system startup
                 procedure, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:DTM$STARTUP.COM

                 To use the product on other nodes in the OpenVMS
                 Cluster, you must replace the version of the DCL tables
                 installed on the other OpenVMS Cluster nodes. To do
                 this, perform the following steps:

                 a. Log in to a node on the cluster.






              Installing the Compaq Digital Test Manager for OpenVMS 4-9

 






              b. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

                 $ INSTALL REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

              c. Repeat Steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

           See Chapter 9 for information on post-installation
           procedures.

     4.5 Running DTM on a Mixed OpenVMS Cluster

           You might want to run DTM on a mixed OpenVMS Cluster
           that supports various versions of OpenVMS software on
           different nodes. If so, you cannot install DTM on only one
           system. For example, if DTM is to be used for interactive
           terminal testing on an OpenVMS Cluster that includes two
           systems running OpenVMS Versions 6.2 and 7.2, DTM must be
           installed on both systems.

             Installing the Compaq Language-Sensitive Editor for OpenVMS



              This chapter explains how to install the Compaq Language-
              Sensitive Editor for OpenVMS (LSE) software.

              The first two sections present installation and user ac-
              count requirements. Section 5.3 continues the installation
              process from where it left off in Section 2.6. Finally,
              the chapter describes how to run LSE on multiple nodes
              of an OpenVMS Cluster. This chapter also includes some
              post-installation information.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                LSE release notes, up to and including this version,
                can be found in SYS$HELP:LSEnnn.RELEASE_NOTES (where
                nnn is the version and update number, such as 047
                for Version 4.7).

        5.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The Compaq DECset Environment Manager for OpenVMS (ENVMGR)
              is installed as part of the installation of the LSE
              component. ENVMGR consists of the following:

              o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

              o  DCL interface

              o  DECwindows interface

              The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

           The LSE installation takes approximately 3 to 10 minutes,
           depending on the type of media, your system configuration,
           and whether you are performing a product upgrade or a new
           installation. Before installing LSE, you must have SETPRV
           privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV privileges. In
           addition, you must have the available resources specified
           in Table 5-1.

              __________________________________________________________
              [1]A paging file quota of 40,000 pages is recommended if
              you are using the REPORT command.

              A FILLM of 20 is appropriate for a typical LSE usage
              pattern and enables LSE to exhibit full functionality.
              It might be necessary to grant higher FILLM quotas to
              user accounts where LSE is frequently used to edit a large
              number of files simultaneously. Buffer-change journaling
              causes user accounts to consume increased quantities of
              FILLM. One buffer-change journal file is maintained for
              each editing buffer. For example, 30 user buffers that are
              journaled require a total of 30 units of FILLM.



         Installing the Compaq Language-Sensitive Editor for OpenVMS 5-3

 






           The items in the following list require additional units
           of FILLM:

           o  Buffer-change journal files

           o  SCA databases

           o  Reading and writing of source files

           o  Diagnostic file for the REVIEW command

           o  Keystroke journaling

           o  Image activation of other components, such as SCA and
              CMS

           Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
           the current values of these quotas with the requirements
           for LSE. For example, the account used in the following
           example is the SYSTEM account:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
           $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
           UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

           To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
           Authorize Utility MODIFY command. For example:

           UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM /ASTLM=100 <Return>

           For more information, see the OpenVMS System Management
           Utilities Reference Manual.

           After you log in to a privileged account to install SCA,
           invoke VMSINSTAL, the command procedure that installs
           this product. For an example of this procedure and a
           description of its options, see Section 2.5.

        5.3 Installing LSE

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Default values appear in
              brackets throughout the installation procedure.

              The following steps are performed as part of any DECset
              installation, and are accomplished before the component-
              specific steps described in this chapter:

              1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
                 device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

              2. Invoke VMSINSTAL with a kit on CD-ROM.

              3. Confirm system backup.

              4. Select a release notes option.

              5. Select components to install.

              6. Install the ENVMGR component.

              See Section 2.6 for full descriptions of these universal,
              preliminary installation steps.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
              proceed from Step 2.

              7. Respond to license registration queries.

                 LSE supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
                 (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
                 information about your product and then asks if you
                 have registered and loaded your product authorization
                 key (PAK) for LSE. The following is an example of such
                 information:










         Installing the Compaq Language-Sensitive Editor for OpenVMS 5-5

 






              %DECSET-I-START_LSE, The following questions relate to LSE
              installation.

              Product:       VAXSET
              Producer:      DEC
              Version:       12.4

              Product:       LSE
              Producer:      DEC
              Version:       4.7

              * Is one of these authorization keys registered and loaded 
              [YES]? <Return>

              If you have not registered and loaded your PAK,
              answer NO to this question. You must then stop the
              installation, register and load your PAK, then restart
              the installation.

              If you incorrectly answer YES, you will receive a
              message indicating that you are not licensed to run
              the product, and the installation procedure will be
              terminated.

           8. Select installation options.

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation 
              [YES]? <Return>

              The directories SYS$EXAMPLES, SYS$TEST, SYS$HELP,
              SYS$LIBRARY, SYS$MESSAGE, SYS$STARTUP, VUE$LIBRARY,
              LSE$EXAMPLE, and SYS$SYSTEM might contain previous
              versions of LSE files. These files are replaced during
              the installation with new files, but the old files are
              not automatically purged. Purging is recommended. In
              response to the purging prompt, press Return to purge
              the files or enter NO to keep them.

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? 
              <Return>

              The IVP runs tests to verify that the installation
              was successful. Press Return to run the IVP after the
              installation. If you do not want to run the IVP, enter
              NO in response to the prompt. For more IVP information,
              see Section 9.3.

           9. Install LSE source files option.



     5-6 Installing the Compaq Language-Sensitive Editor for OpenVMS

 






                 The installation procedure asks you if you want to
                 install LSE source files. The following OpenVMS Alpha
                 example shows these files occupying approximately
                 16,000 blocks of space.

                  Please note that the total system disk space consumed 
                  by the unsupported LSE source files is approximately 
                  16,000 blocks.  Compaq recommends not to answer yes to 
                  the following prompt if you are constrained by the free
                  space available on your system disk.

                 * Would you like to install the unsupported LSE source files 
                 [YES]? <Return>

                 The files will be installed in SYS$SYSROOT[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.LSE]

              10.Select default command language option.

                 1 line written to file SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS0.SYSUPD.DECSET nnn]
                 COMM_LANG.OUT;1

                 * Do you want default command language to be VMSLSE or 
                 PORTABLE [VMSLSE]?<Return>

              To select the PORTABLE command language as your system-
              wide default command language, press Return to accept
              the default PORTABLE language.

              To select the VMSLSE command language, which is
              compatible with the command language available in
              versions of LSE prior to Version 4.0, type VMSLSE and
              press Return.

              Individual users can override the system default
              command language. See the Guide to DIGITAL Language-
              Sensitive Editor for OpenVMS Systems for more
              information.

           11.Select language support.

              Templates for some languages are shipped on the LSE
              kit. The installation procedure displays the names
              of the language templates available on the LSE kit
              and asks which ones should be installed. Language
              templates for other layered products that support
              LSE not mentioned in this installation procedure are
              provided in the installation kits for those layered
              products.

              Language templates for Ada, Ada95, BASIC, BLISS, C, COBOL, 
              C++, FORTRAN, FORTRAN 90, MACRO, Pascal, and PL/I as well as 
              templates for the LSE command languages are included in this 
              kit. Templates for other languages that support LSE and are 
              not mentioned are provided in the installation kits for 
              those languages.

              Please choose the languages for which you would like to 
              install support:

           12.Read the informational messages.

              The LSE installation procedure produces a number of
              informational messages that report on the progress of
              the installation.

              The success of this part of the installation is
              indicated by the following message:

              %DECSET-I-DONEASK, You have answered all the questions for LSE
              installation
                  .
                  .
                  .
              This installation added or modified the following files:

              If the installation procedure is successful, new or
              modified files are moved to their target directories.

              The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              files are updated to include the new versions of the
              LSE HELP text and the LSEDIT command-line definition.
              For a list of the added or modified files, see
              Appendix B.

              If you entered YES in response to the prompt that
              requests a file purge at Step 8, previous versions
              of the LSE files are now purged.

           13.Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

              If you chose to run the IVP in Step 8, VMSINSTAL
              now calls the IVP to verify that LSE was installed
              successfully:

              %LSE-I-BEGINIVP, Beginning Language-Sensitive Editor V4.7 IVP
              36 lines written to file DISK:[SYSTEM.SCRATCH]LSE$IVP.LIS;1

              %LSE-I-ENDIVP, Language-Sensitive Editor V4.7 IVP SUCCESSFUL.
              36 lines written to file $1$DIA3:[VMS$COMMON.SYSMGR]LSE$IVP.LIS;1

           14.End the installation procedure.

              If you selected only the LSE installation, the
              VMSINSTAL procedure ends at the same time, as follows:

              %DECSET-I-DONELSE, The installation of LSE completed

                 VMSINSTAL procedure done at 15:49


     5-10 Installing the Compaq Language-Sensitive Editor for OpenVMS

 






                 When the product installation procedure is complete,
                 you can choose to install more products or log out.
                 If you removed any media from the console drive before
                 beginning the installation, you should replace it now.

                 The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in
                 the process symbol tables during the installation.
                 Therefore, if you are going to continue using the
                 system manager's account and you want to restore these
                 symbols, you should log out and log in again.

        5.4 Installing LSE on an OpenVMS Cluster

              If you want to run LSE on multiple nodes of an OpenVMS
              Cluster, first check to see that you have the appropriate
              software license. Then, follow these steps after
              installing LSE:

              1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
                 on each node in the OpenVMS Cluster on which LSE is
                 to be executed, as described in the OpenVMS License
                 Management Utility Manual.

              2. Run SYS$STARTUP:LSE$STARTUP.COM on each node of the
                 cluster that has a software license.

                 To ensure that LSE is installed each time the system
                 is bootstrapped, include the following line in
                 SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM
                 (the site-specific startup file):

                 @SYS$STARTUP:LSE$STARTUP.COM

              3. To use the product on other nodes in the OpenVMS
                 Cluster, you must replace the version of the DCL tables
                 installed on the other OpenVMS Cluster nodes. To do
                 this, perform the following steps:

                 a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

                 b. Run INSTALL, then enter the following command:

                    INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>








        Installing the Compaq Language-Sensitive Editor for OpenVMS 5-11

 






              c. Repeat Steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              The installation procedure modifies the DCL command
              table so the LSEDIT command is recognized and
              processed. However, the previous command table is
              still in effect for those users who are currently
              logged in. All logged-in users who want to use the
              LSEDIT command must log out of the system and log in
              again.

              Installing the Compaq Module Management System for OpenVMS



              This chapter explains how to install the Compaq Module
              Management System for OpenVMS (MMS) software.

              The first two sections present installation and user ac-
              count requirements. Section 6.3 continues the installation
              process from where it left off in Section 2.6. Finally,
              the chapter describes running MMS on multiple nodes of an
              OpenVMS Cluster. This structure is used for each of the
              component chapters, except when a component has specific
              requirements not common to the other components.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                MMS release notes, up to and including this version,
                can be found in SYS$HELP:MMSnnn.RELEASE_NOTES (where
                nnn is the version and update number, such as 034
                for Version 3.4).

                _____________________________________________________

        6.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The Compaq DECset Environment Manager for OpenVMS (ENVMGR)
              is installed as part of the installation of the MMS
              component. ENVMGR consists of the following:

              o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

              o  DCL interface

              o  DECwindows interface

              The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.








          Installing the Compaq Module Management System for OpenVMS 6-1

 






           MMS includes support for forms in Compaq FMS for OpenVMS
           (FMS) libraries. If FMS is not installed on your system,
           the procedure prints a message similar to the following:

           %MMS-I-NOFMSSUPP, MMS will not contain support for FMS.

           To use MMS to access forms stored in FMS libraries, you
           must have already installed FMS on your system. If you
           install or reinstall FMS after you have installed MMS, FMS
           support will not be available. You must reinstall MMS for
           FMS support.

           The MMS installation takes approximately 1 to 3 minutes,
           depending on the type of media, your system configuration,
           and whether you are performing a product upgrade or a new
           installation. Before installing MMS, you must have SETPRV
           privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV privileges. In
           addition, you must have the available resources specified
           in Table 6-1.

              Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
              the current values of these quotas with the requirements
              for each component. The account used in the following
              example is the SYSTEM account:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

              To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
              Authorize Utility MODIFY command. For example:

              UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM /ASTLM=100 <Return>

              For more information, see the OpenVMS System Management
              Utilities Reference Manual.

        6.3 Installing MMS

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Default values appear in
              brackets throughout the installation procedure.

              The following steps are performed as part of any DECset
              installation, and are accomplished before the subsequent
              component-specific steps described in this chapter:

              1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
                 device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

          Installing the Compaq Module Management System for OpenVMS 6-3

 






           2. Invoke VMSINSTAL with a kit on CD-ROM.

           3. Confirm system backup.

           4. Select a release notes option.

           5. Select components to install.

           6. Install the ENVMGR component.

           See Section 2.6 for full descriptions of these universal,
           preliminary installation steps.

           To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
           Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
           deletes all files it has created up to that point and
           returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
           installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
           proceed from Step 2.

           7. Respond to license registration queries.

              MMS supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
              (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
              information about your product and then asks if you
              have registered and loaded your product authorization
              key (PAK) for MMS. The following is an example of such
              information:

              %DECSET-I-START_MMS, The following questions relate to MMS
              installation.

              Product:       VAXSET
              Producer:      DEC
              Version:       12.4

              Product:       MMS
              Producer:      DEC
              Version:       3.4

              * Is one of these authorization keys registered and loaded 
              [YES]? <Return>

              If you have not registered and loaded your PAK,
              answer NO to this question. You must then stop the
              installation, register and load your PAK, and then
              restart the installation.




     6-4 Installing the Compaq Module Management System for OpenVMS

 






                 If you incorrectly answer YES, DECset enables you
                 to complete the installation without running the
                 Installation Verification Procedure (IVP). However,
                 when you try to invoke MMS, you will receive a message
                 indicating that you are not licensed to run the
                 product.

              8. Select installation options.

                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? 
                 <Return>

                 The IVP runs tests to verify that the installation
                 was successful. Press Return to run the IVP after the
                 installation. If you do not want to run the IVP, enter
                 NO in response to the prompt.

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation 
                 [YES]? <Return>

                 %DECSET-I-DONEASK, You have answered all the questions for MMS
                 installation

                 The directories SYS$EXAMPLES, SYS$HELP, and SYS$SYSTEM
                 might contain previous versions of MMS files. These
                 files are replaced during the installation with new
                 files, but the old files are not automatically purged.
                 Purging is recommended. In response to the purging
                 prompt, press Return to purge the files or enter NO to
                 keep them.

              9. Read the informational messages.

                 The MMS installation procedure produces a number of
                 informational messages that report on the progress of
                 the installation.

                 %DECSET-I-START_MMS, MMS V3.4 installation in progress

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set B ...
                 %MMS-I-NOFMSSUPP, MMS will not contain support for FMS.
                 %MMS-I-LINKIMAGE, Linking V3.4.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                You see the NOFMSSUPP message only if the FMS
                software is not installed on your system.

          Installing the Compaq Module Management System for OpenVMS 6-5

 






              The success of the installation is indicated by the
              following message:

              %DECSET-I-DONEMMS, The installation of MMS V3.4 completed

              If the installation procedure is successful, the new or
              modified files are moved to their target directo-
              ries. In addition, the SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and
              SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE files are updated to include
              the new versions of MMS help text and the MMS command-
              line definition.

              If you entered YES in response to the prompt that
              requests a file purge at Step 8, previous versions
              of the MMS files are now purged.

           10.Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

              If you chose to run the IVP in Step 8, VMSINSTAL
              now calls the IVP to verify that MMS was installed
              successfully, and displays the following:

              %MMS-I-BEGINIVP, Beginning Module Management System V3.4 IVP
              %MMS-I-ENDIVP, Module Management System V3.4 IVP SUCCESSFUL.

                 When the product installation procedure is complete,
                 you can choose to install more products or log out.
                 If you removed any media from the console drive before
                 beginning the installation, you must replace it now.

                 The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in
                 the process symbol tables during the installation.
                 Therefore, if you are going to continue using the
                 system manager's account and you want to restore these
                 symbols, you must log out and log in again.

        6.4 Installing MMS on an OpenVMS Cluster

              To run MMS on multiple nodes of an OpenVMS Cluster,
              first check to see that you have the appropriate software
              license. Then, follow these steps after installing MMS:

              1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
                 on each node in the OpenVMS Cluster on which MMS is
                 to be executed, as described in the OpenVMS License
                 Management Utility Manual.

              2. Run SYS$STARTUP:MMS$STARTUP.COM on each node in the
                 cluster that has a software license. In addition, you
                 must add the following line to your system startup
                 procedure, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:MMS$STARTUP.COM

              3. To use the product on other nodes in the OpenVMS
                 Cluster, you must replace the version of the DCL tables
                 installed on the other OpenVMS Cluster nodes. To do
                 this, perform the following steps:

                 a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

                 b. Run INSTALL and enter the following command at the
                    INSTALL> prompt:

                    INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

                c. Repeat Steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

              This chapter explains how to install the Compaq Performance
              and Coverage Analyzer for OpenVMS (PCA) software.

              The first two sections present installation and user ac-
              count requirements. Section 7.3 continues the installation
              process from where it left off in Section 2.6. Finally,
              the chapter describes how to run PCA on multiple nodes of
              an OpenVMS Cluster. This structure is used for each of the
              component chapters, except when a component has specific
              requirements not common to the other components.

           conjunction with PCA. See the Software Product Description
           (SPD) for information on specific versions of this
           software supported by PCA.

     7.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

           The Compaq DECset Environment Manager for OpenVMS (ENVMGR)
           is installed as part of the installation of the PCA
           component. ENVMGR consists of the following:

           o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

           o  DCL interface

           o  DECwindows interface

           The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

           The PCA installation takes approximately 2 to 7 minutes,
           depending on the type of media, your system configuration,
           and whether you are performing a product upgrade or a new
           installation. Before installing PCA, you must have SETPRV
           privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV privileges. In
           addition, you must have the available resources specified
           in Table 7-1.

           Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
           the current values of these quotas with the requirements
           for each component. The account used in the following
           example is the SYSTEM account:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
           $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
           UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

           To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
           Authorize Utility MODIFY command. For example:

           UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM /ASTLM=100 <Return>

           For more information, see the OpenVMS System Management
           Utilities Reference Manual.

     7.3 Installing PCA

           This section contains excerpts from the installation
           procedure and explains each step. Default values appear in
           brackets throughout the installation procedure.


     7-4 Installing the Compaq Performance and Coverage Analyzer for OpenVMS

 






              The following steps are performed as part of any DECset
              installation, and are accomplished before the subsequent
              component-specific steps described in this chapter:

              1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
                 device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

              2. Invoke VMSINSTAL with a kit on CD-ROM.

              3. Confirm system backup.

              4. Select a release notes option.

              5. Select components to install.

              6. Install the ENVMGR component.

              See Section 2.6 for full descriptions of these universal,
              preliminary installation steps.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
              proceed from Step 2.

              7. Respond to license registration queries.

                 PCA supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
                 (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
                 information about your product and asks if you have
                 registered and loaded your product authorization key
                 (PAK) for PCA. The following is an example of such
                 information:

                 %DECSET-I-START_PCA, The following questions relate to PCA
                 installation.

                 Product:       VAXSET
                 Producer:      DEC
                 Version:       12.4

                 Product:       PCA
                 Producer:      DEC
                 Version:       4.7

                 * Is one of these authorization keys registered and loaded 
                 [YES]? <Return>


 Installing the Compaq Performance and Coverage Analyzer for OpenVMS 7-5

 






              If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you
              must answer NO to this question. You must then stop the
              installation, register and load your PAK, and restart
              the installation.

              If you incorrectly answer YES, DECset enables you
              to complete the installation without running the
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP). However,
              when you try to invoke PCA, you will receive a message
              indicating that you are not licensed to run the
              product.

              8. Select installation options.

                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? 
                 <Return>

                 The IVP runs tests to verify that the installation
                 was successful. Press Return to run the IVP after the
                 installation. If you do not want to run the IVP, enter
                 NO in response to the prompt.

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation 
                 [YES]? <Return>

                 The directories SYS$EXAMPLES, SYS$HELP, SYS$LIBRARY,
                 SYS$MANAGER, and SYS$SYSTEM might contain previous
                 versions of PCA files. These files are replaced during
                 the installation with new files, but the old files are
                 not automatically purged. Purging is recommended. In
                 response to the purging prompt, press Return to purge
                 the files or enter NO to keep them.

                 * Do you wish to install the PCA DECwindows analyzer [YES]? 
                 <Return>
                 * Do you wish to install the PCA DECwindows collector [YES]? 
                 <Return>

                 The PCA product consists of two major components, which
                 can be installed individually:

                 o  The Collector-Gathers various performance and test
                    data on your running application

                 o  The Analyzer-Processes and displays that data
                    graphically, as a standalone utility

              9. Install the PCA demo package.

                 * Do you want to install the PCA demo package [YES]? <Return>

                 %DECSET-I-DONEASK, You have answered all the questions for PCA
                 installation

                 The VMSINSTAL procedure asks if you want to install the
                 optional PCA demo package. If you enter YES (the default,
                 the SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.PCA] directory is created,
                 and all the demo files are copied into it. The system
                 logical name PCA$EXAMPLES that points to this directory
                 is also defined. After the installation, you can run
                 the demos with @PCA$EXAMPLES:PCA_DEMO.

           10.Read the informational messages.

              The PCA installation procedure produces a number of
              informational messages that report on the progress of
              the installation.

              The success of the installation is indicated by the
              following message:

              %DECSET-I-DONEPCA, The installation of PCA completed

              If the installation procedure is successful, new or
              modified files are moved to their target directories.

              The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              files are updated to include the new versions of the
              PCA Help text and the PCA command-line definition.

              The PCA installation optionally adds or replaces the
              SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.PCA] directory and its
              contents.

              If you typed YES in response to the prompt that
              requests a file purge at Step 8, previous versions
              of the PCA files are now purged.

           11.Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

              If you chose to run the IVP in Step 8, VMSINSTAL now
              calls the IVP to verify that PCA was successfully
              installed.

              If PCA has been successfully installed, the IVP
              displays the following message:

              %PCA-I-BEGINIVP, Beginning PCA V4.7 IVP

                  Saving previously defined PCA logical names...
                  Linking IVP image file...
                  Running Collector test...
                  Running Analyzer test...

              12.End the installation procedure.

                    Installation of PCA V4.7 completed at 15:49

                    VMSINSTAL procedure done at 15:49

                 When the product installation procedure is complete,
                 you can choose to install more products or log out.
                 If you removed any media from the console drive before
                 beginning the installation, you must replace it now.

                 The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in
                 the process symbol tables during the installation.
                 Therefore, if you are going to continue using the
                 system manager's account and you want to restore these
                 symbols, you must log out and log in again.

        7.4 Installing PCA on an OpenVMS Cluster

              If you want to run PCA on multiple nodes of an OpenVMS
              Cluster, first check to see that you have the appropriate
              software license. Then, follow these steps after
              installing PCA:

              1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
                 on each node in the OpenVMS Cluster on which PCA is
                 to be executed, as described in the OpenVMS License
                 Management Utility Manual.

              2. Execute PCA$STARTUP.COM on each node of the cluster
                 that has a software license. In addition, you must add
                 the following line to your system startup procedure,
                 SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:PCA$STARTUP.COM

              3. To use the product on other nodes in the OpenVMS
                 Cluster, you must replace the version of the DCL tables
                 installed on the other OpenVMS Cluster nodes. To do
                 this, perform the following steps:

                 a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

                 b. Run INSTALL and enter the following command at the
                    INSTALL> prompt:

                    INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>




 Installing the Compaq Performance and Coverage Analyzer for OpenVMS 7-9

 






              c. Repeat Steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              The installation procedure modifies the DCL
              command table so the PCA command is recognized and
              processed. However, the previous command table is
              still in effect for those users who are currently
              logged in. All logged-in users who want to use the
              PCA command must log out of the system and log in
              again.

                  Installing the Compaq Source Code Analyzer for OpenVMS



              This chapter explains how to install the Compaq Source
              Code Analyzer for OpenVMS (SCA) software.

              The first two sections present installation and user ac-
              count requirements. Section 8.3 continues the installation
              process from where it left off in Section 2.6. Finally,
              the chapter describes how to run SCA on multiple nodes of
              an OpenVMS Cluster. This structure is used for each of the
              component chapters, except when a component has specific
              requirements not common to the other components.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                SCA release notes, up to and including this version,
                can be found in SYS$HELP:SCAnnn.RELEASE_NOTES (where
                nnn is the version and update number, such as 047

        8.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The Compaq DECset Environment Manager for OpenVMS (ENVMGR)
              is installed as part of the installation of the SCA
              component. ENVMGR consists of the following:

              o  Run-time component used by DECset layered products

              o  DCL interface

              o  DECwindows interface

              The DCL and DECwindows interface components are optional.

           The installation of SCA takes approximately 2 to 5
           minutes, depending on the type of media, your system
           configuration, and whether you are performing a product
           upgrade or a new installation. Before installing SCA, you
           must have SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
           privileges. In addition, you must have the available
           resources specified in Table 8-1.

              Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
              the current values of these quotas with the requirements
              for SCA. For example, the account used in the following
              example is the SYSTEM account:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

              To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
              Authorize Utility MODIFY command. For example:

              UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM /ASTLM=100 <Return>

              For more information, see the OpenVMS System Management
              Utilities Reference Manual.

     8.3 Installing SCA

           This section contains excerpts from the installation
           procedure and explains each step. Default values appear
           in brackets throughout the installation procedure. The
           following steps are performed as part of any DECset
           installation, and are accomplished before the subsequent
           component-specific steps described in this chapter:

           1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
              device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

           2. Invoke VMSINSTAL with a kit on CD-ROM.

           3. Confirm system backup.

           4. Select a release notes option.

           5. Select components to install.

           6. Install the ENVMGR component.

           See Section 2.6 for full descriptions of these universal,
           preliminary installation steps.

           To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
           Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
           deletes all files it has created up to that point and
           returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
           installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
           proceed from Step 2.

           7. Respond to license registration queries.

              SCA supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility
              (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
              information about your product and then asks if you
              have registered and loaded your product authorization
              key (PAK) for SCA. The following is an example of such
              information:











     8-4 Installing the Compaq Source Code Analyzer for OpenVMS

 






                 %DECSET-I-START_SCA, The following questions relate to SCA
                 installation.

                         Product:       VAXSET
                         Producer:      DEC
                         Version:       12.4

                         Product:       LSE
                         Producer:      DEC
                         Version:       4.7

                         Note: LSE and SCA share the LSE license.

                 * Is one of these authorization keys registered and loaded 
                 [YES]?

                 If you have not registered and loaded your PAK,
                 answer NO to this question. You must then stop the
                 installation, register and load your PAK, then restart
                 the installation.

                 If you incorrectly answer YES, DECset enables you
                 to complete the installation without running the
                 Installation Verification Procedure (IVP). However,
                 when you try to invoke SCA, you will receive a message
                 indicating that you are not licensed to run the
                 product.
























              Installing the Compaq Source Code Analyzer for OpenVMS 8-5

 






           8. Choose the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
              options.

              The IVP runs tests to verify that the installation
              was successful. There are two parts to the SCA IVP:
              one that tests the character-cell version of SCA, and
              one that tests the DECwindows version. If you want to
              run the character cell or both parts of the IVP, press
              Return in response to the following IVP prompt:

              As well as verifying that the installation succeeded, the IVP also
              creates the SCA example library. It is therefore recommended that
              you run the IVP.

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? 
              <Return>

              Entering YES to this prompt causes the following
              information to be displayed:

         The IVP has two sections, a character cell section and a DECwindows
         section. In order for the DECwindows section to run correctly, the
         logical name DECW$DISPLAY must be appropriately set (using the SET
         DISPLAY command). If at this time you are not prepared to run the
         DECwindows portion of the IVP, enter NO at the following prompt.

         You can rerun the IVP later by issuing the command:

         @SYS$TEST:SCA$IVP

                * Do you wish to run the whole IVP [YES]?

              If you do not want to run the DECwindows part of
              the IVP because, for example, you do not have an
              appropriate display device, enter NO to the previous
              prompt. If you are running the installation at a remote
              node, set your DECwindows display using the following
              command:

              $ SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=nodename <Return>

              The nodename is the name of your local node where the
              display should appear. See the online Help for more
              information on setting your DECwindows display device.

              It is highly recommended that you run the IVP not
              only to verify that the installation succeeded, but
              also to set up a sample SCA library and to have the
              logical name SCA$EXAMPLE refer to that library. The
              installation places the necessary files in the sample

     8-6 Installing the Compaq Source Code Analyzer for OpenVMS

 






                 directory and the IVP creates the sample SCA library
                 in that directory. The IVP also sets up an example
                 library for the program design facility (PDF), referred
                 to by the logical name SCA$2167A. If you choose not
                 to run the IVP, enter NO at the previous prompt. You
                 can run the IVP after the installation by entering the
                 following command:

                 $ @SYS$TEST:SCA$IVP<Return>

                 For more information on running the IVP manually after
                 the installation is complete, see Section 9.3.

              9. Select installation options.

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation 
                 [YES]?

                 Please indicate the components of SCA that you wish to install:

                       1 - Both SCA client and server
                       2 - SCA client only

                 * Enter the number corresponding to the SCA components to 
                 install [1]:

                 If you install the SCA server, two accounts are
                 created: SCA$SERVER and SCA$DEFAULT.

                 The server code itself runs under the SCA$SERVER
                 account. This account has no special privileges,
                 but is granted access to all SCA library directories
                 by an access control list (ACL) that is added when
                 libraries are created. This installation also grants
                 READ and EXECUTE access for the SCA$SERVER account
                 to the NETPROXY database, which it uses to verify
                 remote users' access to SCA libraries where the server
                 is running. The image executed by the SCA server,
                 SCA$SERVER_MAIN, is installed with SYSPRV and SYSNAM
                 privileges.

                 This installation defines the SCA$SERVER object in the
                 network database. A password for the SCA$SERVER account
                 can either be generated randomly or defined manually.
                 In either case, the password is added to the Network
                 Control Program (NCP) database. If you decide to change
                 the SCA$SERVER account password in the future, you must
                 remember to update the SCA$SERVER object password also
                 by using NCP.


              Installing the Compaq Source Code Analyzer for OpenVMS 8-7

 






              Another account, SCA$DEFAULT, is created by the
              installation to grant access to remote users who do
              not have proxy access to the local node. This account
              has no special privileges.

              Both these accounts must have unique User Identification
              Codes (UICs). You are prompted to enter information for
              these accounts as in the following example:

              In order to grant access to remote users who do not have a proxy
              account for the local node, SCA creates the SCA$DEFAULT account,
              which is used as a default proxy account for SCA library access.

              This account has no special privileges.

                You must specify a unique UIC for this account in order
                to ensure proper security of your libraries.

                The password for the account should normally be automatically
                generated by SCA.  A user-supplied password may also be given
                (minimum size 10).  If a user-supplied password is provided, it
                will not be logged in the Auto Answer file and cannot be used 
                for automated installs.

              * Do you want to specify a password [NO]? yes

                 Please enter a password of at least 10 characters.

                In order to grant access to remote users who do not have a proxy
                account for the local node, SCA creates the SCA$SERVER account,
                which is used as a default proxy account for SCA library access.

                This account has no special privileges.

                   You must specify a unique UIC for this account in order
                   to ensure proper security of your libraries.

                The password for the account should normally be automatically
                generated by SCA.  A user-supplied password may also be given
                (minimum size 10), a reason for a user-supplied password is
                when multiple network databases need updating in a cluster.
                If a user-supplied password is provided, it will not be

                The network object SCA$SERVER has been defined. If you wish
                to view this, run SYS$SYSTEM:NCP and enter the command
                      NCP> LIST OBJECT SCA$SERVER CHAR

              See Section 8.5 for information on the SCA server
              installation and the quotas assigned to the SCA$SERVER
              and SCA$DEFAULT accounts.

           10.Read the informational messages.

              The SCA installation procedure produces a number of
              informational messages that report on the progress of
              the installation:

              %DECSET-I-DONESCA, The installation of SCA completed

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target
              directories...

              If the installation procedure is successful, new or
              modified files are moved to their target directories.

              The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              files are updated to include the new versions of the
              SCA HELP text and the SCA command-line definition. For
              a list of the added or modified files, see Appendix B.

           11.Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

              If you chose to run the IVP in Step 8, VMSINSTAL
              now calls the IVP to verify that SCA was installed
              successfully. If you answered YES to running the entire
              IVP, the DECwindows portion requires user action. The
              SCA main window appears on the screen. Use the mouse
              to choose the Exit menu option from the File pull-down
              menu. The IVP then continues. See Section C.1 to see
              what to do in the event of a failure.

              Event files are created by the IVP for the SCA and PDF
              sample libraries.

                 The character cell portion of the IVP has completed 
                 successfully. The DECwindows section will now execute.

                 The SCA main window should appear on your display.  It
                 will be set to the SCA Example library.  Verify that
                 this is the case, and then choose EXIT from the FILE menu.

                 If the DECset Environment Manager did not already appear on
                 your display, please verify that it appears as an icon as a
                 result of executing this IVP; then, restore the icon and
                 choose EXIT from the FILE menu.  (If the DECset Environment 
                 Manager was on your display prior to the execution of this 
                 IVP and a context had previously been applied via the 
                 DECset Environment Manager's main window, that context will 
                 be applied to SCA as part of SCA initialization.)

                 %SCA-I-ENDIVP, Source Code Analyzer V4.7 IVP SUCCESSFUL.

                 In addition, if you typed YES in response to the prompt
                 that requests a file purge, previous versions of SCA
                 files are now purged.

              12.End the installation procedure.

                    Installation of SCA V4.7 completed at 15:49

                  Adding history entry in VMI$ROOT:[SYSUPD]VMSINSTAL.HISTORY

                    VMSINSTAL procedure done at 15:49

                 When the product installation procedure is complete,
                 you can choose to install more products or log out.
                 If you removed any media from the console drive before
                 beginning the installation, you should replace it now.

                 The VMSINSTAL procedure deletes or changes entries in
                 the process symbol tables during the installation.
                 Therefore, if you are going to continue using the
                 system manager's account and you want to restore these
                 symbols, you must log out and log in again.

     8.4 Installing SCA on an OpenVMS Cluster

           If you want to run SCA on multiple nodes of an OpenVMS
           Cluster, first check to see that you have the appropriate
           software license. Then, follow these steps after
           installing SCA:

           1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
              on each node in the OpenVMS Cluster on which SCA is
              to be executed, as described in the OpenVMS License
              Management Utility Manual.

           2. Run SYS$STARTUP:SCA$STARTUP.COM on each node of the
              cluster that has a software license.

              To ensure that SCA is installed each time the system
              is bootstrapped, include the following line in
              SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM
              (the site-specific startup file):

              @SYS$STARTUP:SCA$STARTUP.COM

           3. To use the product on other nodes in the OpenVMS
              Cluster, you must replace the version of the DCL tables
              installed on the other OpenVMS Cluster nodes. To do
              this, perform the following steps:

              a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

              b. Run INSTALL and enter the following command at the
                 INSTALL> prompt:

                 INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

              c. Repeat Steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

        8.5 SCA Server Installation

              SCA provides a server that enables remote users to access
              your local SCA libraries. The installation of this server
              is optional.

              You will be prompted during the installation as to whether
              you would like to install both the SCA server and the SCA
              client, or whether you would like to install only the SCA
              client.

              If you elect to install only the SCA client, remote users
              will not be able to access your local SCA libraries. SCA
              users on your local system will not be affected. They will
              have the ability to use local libraries and libraries on
              remote nodes where the SCA server has been installed.

              If you elect to install the optional SCA server, accounts
              named SCA$SERVER and SCA$DEFAULT are created for the SCA
              server. The accounts are given the following quotas:

              Username: SCA$SERVER              Owner:  DEC_SCA_SERVER
              Account:  DECNET                  UIC:    [370,355] ([SCA$SERVER])

              account read and execute access.

              If any problems occur at run time, the SCA server creates
              an error log file in SYS$SPECIFIC:[SCA$SERVER]. One
              possible error is server failure due to insufficient
              virtual memory. If this occurs frequently, you might want
              to increase PGFLQUO for the SCA$SERVER account.

              If you are reinstalling SCA, stop any previous SCA servers
              (network processes named SCA$SERVER_nnnn) so they will be
              restarted using the new server code. Use the DCL commands
              SHOW SYSTEM/NETWORK and STOP/IDENTIFICATION, respectively.

     8.6 Installing SCA Server on an OpenVMS Cluster

           When the SCA server is installed, it creates or modifies
           the SCA$SERVER network object and the SCA$SERVER user
           account. If a password is not manually supplied during
           installation, a random password is generated and set
           on both the object and the account for each node in the
           cluster. If the SCA server is installed in a cluster with
           a common user authorization file but distinct network
           databases, then the password will not be set correctly in
           some of the network databases.

           To resolve this problem, you must manually set the
           password in the authorization file and in all network
           databases during the main SCA installation. Make sure to
           use the same account password for all subsequent nodes in
           the cluster. See step 9 in Section 8.3 for an example of
           supplying a user-defined password during installation.

                                                  After the Installation



              Your DECset components are now installed and can be
              invoked by all users.

              The installation procedure modifies the DCL command table
              so the component invocation command is recognized and
              processed. However, the previous command table is still
              in effect for those users who are currently logged in.
              All logged-in users who want to use the updated version
              of each component must log out of the system and log in
              again.

        9.1 OpenVMS Cluster Setup

              After you install DECset in an OpenVMS Cluster, you must
              perform the following tasks on each licensed node that
              does not share common system files:

              o  Modify the SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM file and
                 execute the startup procedures for the installed
                 components.

              o  Install DCLTABLES.EXE.

              o  Register the licenses for DECset.

              You must edit SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM, the site-
              specific startup file, and add the following lines for the
              Environment Manager and each of the installed components:

                 @SYS$STARTUP:ENVMGR$STARTUP.COM
                 @SYS$STARTUP:[component]$STARTUP.COM

              The DECset installation procedure puts the startup command
              file for each component in the SYS$STARTUP directory.

              For more details, see the section on OpenVMS Cluster
              installation in the appropriate component chapter.

     9.2 OpenVMS Mail Utility

           You can use LSE to read and compose messages from the
           Mail utility. You can define the logical name MAIL$EDIT as
           CALLABLE_LSE to use the editor from MAIL. Note that LSE
           must be installed as a known image. This is accomplished
           through the editor's startup command procedure. In
           addition, CMS and SCA must be installed as known images
           to be used from LSE when LSE is invoked from the Mail
           utility. (See Chapter 8 for instructions on installing
           SCA.)

     9.3 Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

           The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for each
           DECset component checks the integrity of installed files,
           either as part of the VMSINSTAL procedure or separately,
           as described here. Compaq strongly recommends that you run
           the IVPs after you install the components. Each component
           installation puts a command procedure in SYS$TEST for you
           to invoke. Table 9-1 lists the DECset component IVPs.

           Table 9-1 DECset IVPs
           __________________________________________________________

           Component     Procedure Name
           __________________________________________________________

           ENVMGR        ENVMGR$IVP
           CMS           CMS$IVP
           DTM           DTM$IVP
           LSE           LSE$IVP
           MMS           MMS$IVP
           PCA           PCA$IVP
           SCA           SCA$IVP
           __________________________________________________________

           The following command shows how to invoke the LSE
           component IVP:

           $ @SYS$TEST:LSE$IVP.COM

           The IVP creates a temporary subdirectory in your current,
           default directory, and places a library for each component
           in this subdirectory. The IVP then creates two additional
           levels of subdirectories; therefore, your current default
           directory must not be a subdirectory deeper than six




     9-2 After the Installation

 






              levels. In addition, your current default directory must
              not be defined as a directory search list. The temporary
              subdirectory is deleted at the end of the execution of the
              IVP.

              If the IVP fails, the IVP displays a message such as the
              following:
       
              %CMS-E-IVPFAILURE, CMS V4.1 IVP failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for CMS V4.1 has failed.

              See Section C.1 for information on what to do when a
              failure occurs.

     9.4 Product Updates

           Compaq might periodically issue updates of DECset.
           Each update consists of an installation kit. You must
           install this kit as described in this document, or in any
           documentation that accompanies the update.

           In addition, the update includes new release notes. The
           release notes describe the changes made to each DECset
           component since the previous release. The release notes
           for each update are provided online. Compaq strongly
           recommends that you read the release notes before you
           install any DECset components. They are also accessible at
           any time after the product is installed. For information
           on accessing the release notes before installing any
           DECset components, follow the installation procedure
           for each component. To locate the release notes after
           installation, display or print the release notes file as
           described in Section 1.3.

     9.5 DECset as a Shared Image

           When you expect a product to be used extensively on your
           system, you would usually reduce the system overhead and
           memory requirements by installing the software as a shared
           image. However, this process is unnecessary for DECset,
           because the VMSINSTAL procedure automatically installs the
           following components as a shared image:

           o  Compaq DECset Environment Manager for OpenVMS

           o  Compaq Code Management System for OpenVMS

           o  Compaq Digital Test Manager for OpenVMS

           o  Compaq Language-Sensitive Editor for OpenVMS

         Version:      4.7

         Note: LSE and SCA share the LSE license.

 * Is one of these authorization keys registered and loaded [YES]? <Return>

         As well as verifying that the installation succeeded, the IVP also
         creates the SCA example library.  It is therefore recommended that
         you run the IVP.

 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? <Return>

         The IVP has two sections, a character-cell section and a DECwindows
         section.  In order for the DECwindows section to run correctly, the
         logical name DECW$DISPLAY must be appropriately set (using the SET
         DISPLAY command).  If at this time you are not prepared to run the
         DECwindows portion of the IVP, enter NO at the following prompt.

  You can rerun the IVP later by entering the command:

  @SYS$TEST:SCA$IVP

 * Do you wish to run the whole IVP [YES]? no <Return>
 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>

         Please indicate the components of SCA that you wish to install:

             1 - Both SCA client and server
             2 - SCA client only

 * Enter the number corresponding to the SCA components to install [1]: <Return>



     A-6 Sample Installation Procedure

 






      In order to grant access to remote users who do not have a proxy account
      for the local node, SCA creates the SCA$DEFAULT account, which is
      used as a default proxy account for SCA library access.

      This account has no special privileges.

      The password for the account should normally be automatically generated 
      by SCA. A user-supplied password may also be given (minimum size 10).  
      If a user-supplied password is provided it will not be logged in the
      Auto Answer file and cannot be used for automated installs.

      If the account does not already exist you will be asked to specify a
      unique UIC for the account.

         You must specify a unique UIC for this account in order
         to ensure proper security of your libraries.

    * Do you want to specify a password [NO]? <Return>
    * Enter UIC for SCA$DEFAULT account (include brackets) [[371,345]]: <Return>

      In order to ensure that the SCA server runs with the proper quotas,
      this installation procedure will create an account for the server.  This
      account, SCA$SERVER, has no special privileges and is set up only for
      network operation.

      The password for the account should normally be automatically generated 
      by SCA. A user-supplied password may also be given (minimum size 10), 
      a reason for a user-supplied password is when multiple network 
      databases need updating in a cluster.  If a user-supplied password is 
      provided it will not be logged in the Auto Answer file and cannot 
      be used for automated installs.

      If the account does not already exist you will be asked to specify a
      unique UIC for the account.

         You must specify a unique UIC for this account in order to ensure
         proper security of your libraries.  The SCA server account is
         automatically granted access to each library created, via Access
         Control Lists.

      If you want to change the name of this account after the installation
      has completed, you must also change the password in the NCP database
      with the SET OBJECT SCA$SERVER PASSWORD command.

    * Do you want to specify a password [NO]? <Return>
    * Enter UIC for SCA$SERVER account (include brackets) [[370,355]]: <Return>

   %DECSET-I-DONEASK, You have answered all the questions for SCA installation

                                                  Recovering from Errors



              This appendix provides information to help you with
              failures or errors that might occur during product
              installation or product use.

        C.1 Failures During DECset Installation

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks if you want to continue the
              installation. In some instances, you can enter Yes to
              continue. To stop the installation process and correct the
              situation, enter No and press return. Correct the problem
              and restart the installation.

              If errors occur during the installation itself, or when
              the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is running,
              VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
              fails, you see a message such as the following:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of CMS V4.1 has failed.

              If the IVP fails during the installation, the IVP displays
              a message such as the following:

              %CMS-E-IVPFAILURE, CMS V4.1 IVP failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for CMS V4.1 has failed.

              If you have installed the SCA Server on an OpenVMS
              Cluster, authorization problems might cause an SCA IVP
              failure, such as the following:

              **** Client testing complete ****
              %SCA-I-CONNECTING, Requesting connection to 0::

           This system message indicates that the DECset Server will
           not start. The most common cause is that the password in
           the network database and the system authorization file are
           not the same. To verify this, enable privileges and issue
           the following NCP command:

           NCP> SHOW OBJECT SCA$SERVER CHAR

           After the password is displayed, use it to attempt to log
           in to the SCA$SERVER account. You should fail and receive
           the following message:

               You are not authorized to login from this source

           If instead the password is wrong, the system displays the
           following failure message:

               User authorization failure

           See Section 8.6 for an explanation of why the password
           might be in error, and the actions to correct this
           situation.

           Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
           following conditions exist:

           o  The operating system version is incorrect.

           o  The prerequisite software version is incorrect.

           o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
              insufficient (see Section 2.3).

           o  Process quotas required by VMSINSTAL are incorrect (see
              Section 2.5).

           o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

           o  The product license was registered incorrectly, or not
              registered and loaded.

           For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
           conditions, see the OpenVMS Systems Messages: Companion Guide
           for Help Message Users, your processor-specific
           installation and operations guide, or the OpenVMS License
           Management Utility Manual.

           If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
           you must take the appropriate action as described in the
           message. You might need to change a system parameter, or
           increase an authorized quota value.
