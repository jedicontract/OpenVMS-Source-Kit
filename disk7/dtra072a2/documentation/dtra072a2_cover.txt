          Before You Install Compaq DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A for OpenVMS
          VAX Systems

          Order Number: AV-L770W-TE

          This letter includes information on Compaq[TM]DATATRIEVE [TM]
          Version 7.2A for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] systems. This is a new
          version of an existing product; see the DATATRIEVE Release Notes
          for a description of the new features and bug fixes provided in
          Compaq DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A.

          Please note that DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A clients cannot com-
          municate with DATATRIEVE servers from earlier versions. Simi-
          larly, a DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A server cannot communicate with
          DATATRIEVE clients from earlier versions. If you install DATA-
          TRIEVE Version 7.2A and then wish to ready a domain on a remote
          node, the remote node must also have DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A
          installed. This requirement is new to DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A.

          DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A now provides a feature to allow for the
          modification of the behavior of DATATRIEVE so that the century
          digits applied to a 2-digit year date may be based on a customer
          specified value. DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A now uses a so-called
          sliding window capability for the translation of DATATRIEVE 2-
          digit year dates, based on the definition of the DTR$BASE_DATE
          logical. See the DATATRIEVE Release Notes for more information.

          The primary new feature incorporated into DATATRIEVE Version 7.2
          for OpenVMS VAX Systems was HTML report generation. This feature
          provides the capability to create reports in HTML, extending the
          platforms to which you can port.

          The following modules, which previously required a separate
          installation, are integrated with DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A:

          o  The Compound Document Architecture (CDA) Postscript converter

          o  Compaq DATATRIEVE Client for Microsoft Windows

          Contents of this Kit

          This package contains the Compaq DATATRIEVE software and in-
          stallation instructions. The Compaq DATATRIEVE software was
          previously referred to as DEC DATATRIEVE and DIGITAL DATATRIEVE.
          In this letter and in the product documentation, all references
          to DATATRIEVE should be understood as referring to the product
          Compaq DATATRIEVE for OpenVMS VAX Systems.

          The software and instructions consist of:
