                                          Preinstallation Considerations



              This chapter includes important installation consid-
              erations that you must be aware of before you install
              DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A. Read this chapter carefully
              before you proceed to Chapter 2, DATATRIEVE Installation
              Procedure.

              To prepare your system for installing DATATRIEVE, you must
              perform the following tasks:

              o  Verify that your system has enough memory and available
                 disk space to install and use DATATRIEVE.

              o  Register the Product Authorization Key (PAK) that
                 is shipped with DATATRIEVE (if this is the first
                 installation of DATATRIEVE).

              o  Verify that your system has the correct versions of the
                 optional and required software you will be using with
                 DATATRIEVE.

              o  Check your system and the installing account to
                 ensure that parameters and quotas are sufficient for
                 installing and using DATATRIEVE.

              This chapter tells you what actions to take to prepare
              your system for installing DATATRIEVE.

        1.1 Prerequisite Hardware

              Installing DATATRIEVE requires a certain amount of
              free disk storage space during the installation. Once
              DATATRIEVE is installed, less storage space is required.

              The following table summarizes the storage requirements
              for OpenVMS VAX operating systems.

     1.2 OpenVMS Licensing Management Facility (LMF)

           This version of DATATRIEVE supports the License Management
           Facility provided by OpenVMS. See the OpenVMS documenta-
           tion for more information.

           If you receive a Product Authorization Key (PAK) with
           DATATRIEVE you should register the information contained
           in the PAK before you begin the installation. You can
           register by using the License command procedure using the
           following command:

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE

           You can also use the LICENSE REGISTER command to register
           the information contained in the PAK. Both methods are
           described in the OpenVMS documentation.

           DATATRIEVE asks you early in the installation procedure
           whether or not you have registered and loaded an
           authorization key. You can install this version of
           DATATRIEVE without the authorization key information, but

              you cannot run DATATRIEVE or the Installation Verification
              Procedure (IVP).

        1.3 Prerequisite Software

              You must have the correct versions of the optional
              and required software products you will be using with
              DATATRIEVE. Install those products in the order specified
              in Section 1.3.3, Order of Product Installation.

              1.3.1 Required Software Products

              This version of DATATRIEVE is a complete kit. You do not
              need any previous versions of DATATRIEVE to install it.

              On OpenVMS VAX operating systems, DATATRIEVE Version
              7.2A requires Version 5.5-2, 6.2, 7.1 or higher of the
              operating system. For Fullname support OpenVMS VAX Version
              6.2 is required. To check which version of the operating
              system is currently installed on your system, use the SHOW
              SYSTEM command at the DCL prompt. <>

              On OpenVMS Alpha operating systems, DATATRIEVE Version
              7.2A requires Version 6.2 or higher of the operating
              system. <>

              1.3.2 Optional Software Products

              The following optional products can be used along with
              DATATRIEVE:

              o  Oracle CDD/Repository

                 If you plan to install DATATRIEVE with Oracle
                 CDD/Repository support, the following requirements
                 apply:

                 -  On OpenVMS VAX operating systems, you must have
                    Version 5.0 or higher of Oracle CDD/Repository[TM]
                    before you can install DATATRIEVE. <>

                 -  On OpenVMS Alpha operating systems, you must have
                    Version 5.3 or higher of Oracle CDD/Repository
                    before you can install DATATRIEVE. <>

     Preinstallation Considerations
     1.3 Prerequisite Software

              To check which version of Oracle CDD/Repository is
              currently installed on the system, use the following
              command:

              $ DICTIONARY OPERATOR

              The CDO banner gives the version of Oracle CDD/Repository
              currently installed on your system. For example:

           o  Oracle Rdb

           o  VAX Rdb/ELN

           o  VAX TDMS

           o  Compaq FMS[TM]

           o  Compaq DECforms[TM]

           o  DEC DB Integrator Gateway

           o  LSE

              *  PATHWORKS[TM] for MS-DOS[R] and Windows (for DECnet
                 use only).

              *  A compiler or interpreter that can access DLL
                 libraries (only required if you use the DATATRIEVE
                 Call Interface).

     1-4 Preinstallation Considerations

 



                                          Preinstallation Considerations
                                               1.3 Prerequisite Software

              On OpenVMS Alpha operating systems VAX Rdb/ELN and VAX
              TDMS are not available. <>

              Refer to the DATATRIEVE Before You Install Letter to
              determine which versions of these optional software
              products are compatible with DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A.

              If an optional product is on the system but is not the
              version required by DATATRIEVE, the installation procedure
              will not install the User Environment Test Package (UETP)
              for that product. (Note that not all optional software
              products have a UETP.)

              If you want to ready domains that reside on a remote node,
              you must have Version 7.2A of the DATATRIEVE software
              installed on the remote node you wish to access.

              1.3.3 Order of Product Installation

              When you install required and optional software products
              with DATATRIEVE, you should install these products in the
              following order:

              o  Optional LSE

                 If you plan to use LSE with DATATRIEVE, you should
                 install LSE before installing other required or
                 optional software products. However, if you choose
                 to install LSE at a later date, the DATATRIEVE
                 installation procedure provides you with the option
                 of performing a modified DATATRIEVE installation to
                 provide DATATRIEVE support for LSE at that time.

              o  Optional Oracle Rdb

                 If you plan to use Oracle Rdb with DATATRIEVE, you
                 should follow the order-of-installation instructions
                 provided with Oracle CDD/Repository to insure the
                 proper operation of Oracle CDD/Repository with Oracle
                 Rdb.

              o  Oracle CDD/Repository

              o  Optional forms products ( VAX TDMS, Compaq FMS,
                 DECforms)

              o  Optional database products (Oracle CODASYL DBMS, VAX
                 Rdb/ELN, DEC DB Integrator Gateway)

     Preinstallation Considerations
     1.3 Prerequisite Software

              Install Oracle CODASYL DBMS, VAX Rdb/ELN, and DEC DB
              Integrator Gateway before installing DATATRIEVE to
              make sure the installation includes sample databases
              and User Environment Test Packages. You do not have
              to install these optional database products before
              DATATRIEVE to use the products with DATATRIEVE.

           o  Optional DECwindows Motif

           o  DECnet

           o  Microsoft Windows

           o  PATHWORKS for MS-DOS and Windows.

           o  A compiler or interpreter that can access DLL
              libraries.

           o  DATATRIEVE

              ________________________Note ________________________

              DECforms, and DECwindows Motif can also be installed
              after DATATRIEVE.

              _____________________________________________________

     1.4 VAXcluster Consideration (VAX Only)

           This installation procedure lets you install DATATRIEVE
           only on a system-rooted device. Whether you are installing
           DATATRIEVE on a VAXcluster[TM] or in a nonclustered
           environment, the installation procedure places the files
           that it generates in SYS$COMMON, not in SYS$SPECIFIC.
           The installation defines the logical name DTR$LIBRARY as
           SYS$COMMON:[DTR].

     1.5 VMScluster Consideration

           If you are using a dual-architecture (VAX and Alpha
           systems) heterogeneous cluster, before executing these
           commands, make sure the appropriate logical names have
           been set to define the scope of the SYSMAN DO commands.
           For more information, see the OpenVMS System Manager's
           Manual.

        1.6 Preparing Your System and the Installing Account

              This section tells you which characteristics of your
              system and installing account need to be checked before
              you install DATATRIEVE. These characteristics include
              process quotas, access control privileges to CDD$TOP
              (if you plan to install DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A with
              Oracle CDD/Repository support), and system parameters.
              Instructions are given for checking and modifying the
              relevant characteristics of your system and installing
              account.

              1.6.1 Required Parameters

              You must check that the value of your process quotas
              and system parameters are sufficient for installing
              DATATRIEVE. You can check these values in the Oracle
              CDD/Repository documentation (if you plan to install
              DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A with Oracle CDD/Repository
              support).

              1.6.1.1 Global Pages (or pagelets) and Global Sections
              (GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS Parameters)

              If you plan to install various DATATRIEVE images as
              SHARED, you need sufficient global pages (on OpenVMS
              VAX systems) or pagelets (on OpenVMS Alpha systems), and
              global sections. The installation procedure asks you about
              five images: DDMFxx, DTR32xx, DTRSHRxx, DTRAPIxx, and
              DTRMSGS. (The xx at the end of the file name refers to the
              optional suffix that you can specify in the installation
              procedure. See Section 2.7.4, Specifying Suffixes for
              More than One Installation of This Version of DATATRIEVE
              for more information.) You do not have to install all of
              these images; you need sufficient global pages and global
              sections only for those you do wish to install.

              DATATRIEVE automatically installs the DTRHELP image
              as SHARED. You need sufficient global pages and global
              sections for this image.

                                          Preinstallation Considerations
                    1.6 Preparing Your System and the Installing Account

              1.6.2 Oracle CDD/Repository Considerations (if support
              required)

              If you plan to install DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A with Oracle
              CDD/Repository support, you should perform the following
              tasks:

              o  Check the contents of the dictionary directory
                 CDD$TOP.DTR$LIB for user definitions and subdirecto-
                 ries. Back these up if they exist.

              o  Make sure the installation account has all access
                 privileges to CDD$TOP.

              The next two sections explain these procedures.

              1.6.2.1 Effect of Installation Procedure on Existing
              DTR$LIB Directory

              The directory CDD$TOP.DTR$LIB is reserved for use by
              Compaq. The installation procedure builds, or rebuilds,
              this directory each time you install DATATRIEVE. The
              directory should contain only directories that contain
              definitions for the plots and sample domains, records,
              and tables that are shipped with the product. Users should
              not create any dictionary objects or directories that have
              DTR$LIB as part of their path names.

              When the installation procedure rebuilds DTR$LIB, it
              deletes the existing DTR$LIB hierarchy. Therefore, you
              should check that DATATRIEVE users have not placed their
              own definitions either in DTR$LIB or in any part of its
              substructure. Extract user definitions you want to save
              and redefine them in another directory.

              1.6.2.2 Required Privileges to CDD$TOP

              Because the installation procedure builds or rebuilds
              DTR$LIB, the installation account must have all access
              control privileges to CDD$TOP. You can check these
              privileges with the following command sequence:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:DMU
              DMU> SHOW PROTECTION CDD$TOP

     Preinstallation Considerations
     1.6 Preparing Your System and the Installing Account

           The resulting privileges list should include the
           following:

           CONTROL          GLOBAL_DELETE

           DTR_EXTEND       HISTORY

           DTR_MODIFY       LOCAL_DELETE

           DTR_READ         PASS_THRU

           DTR_WRITE        SEE

           EXTEND           UPDATE

           FORWARD

           After checking the privileges list, type EXIT and press
           the RETURN key to return to DCL command level.

           If any of the required privileges are not available or if
           they are denied or banished, you must change the access
           control list (ACL) entry to provide all privileges for the
           duration of the installation. One way you can do this is
           to enter the following sequence of commands:

           $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:DMU
           DMU> SET PROTECTION/GRANT=ALL/UIC=[1,4]-
           DMU> /POSITION=1 CDD$TOP
           DMU> EXIT

           If you are using an account other than [1,4] for the
           installation, replace [1,4] with the UIC of that account.

           After the installation procedure is complete, you can
           remove the ACL entry with the following command sequence:

           $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:DMU
           DMU> DELETE/PROTECTION/POSITION=1 CDD$TOP
           DMU> EXIT

           For your convenience during future installations of
           DATATRIEVE, you might want to create command files
           containing these two sequences of commands.

                    1.6 Preparing Your System and the Installing Account

              1.6.3 Effect of Installation Procedure on the Logical
              DTR$LIBRARY

              The installation defines the logical DTR$LIBRARY as
              SYS$COMMON:[DTR]. If the installation fails, DTR$LIBRARY
              may be left deassigned, and you must redefine it. To
              redefine the logical, use the DEFINE command, as follows:

              $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC DTR$LIBRARY SYS$COMMON:[DTR]

              1.6.4 More than One Installation of this Version of
              DATATRIEVE

              You can install this version of DATATRIEVE a number of
              times to produce different sets of images and files. Note,
              however, that you cannot install multiple versions of the
              product, such as both Version 7.2 and Version 7.2A. For
              example, the installation procedure could be run first
              to install DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A with VAX TDMS. You can
              install DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A a second time to support
              Compaq FMS. (Note that DECforms is supported by default
              whenever available on the system.) The resulting images
              and file names are differentiated by a suffix added to the
              default names. The installation procedure prompts you to
              choose this suffix.

              The suffix you specify will be given to the following
              files created during installation. The two letters xx at
              the end of a file name stand for the 1- to 26-character
              suffix you specify:

              o  SYS$SHARE:DTRSHRxx.EXE

              o  SYS$SHARE:DTRAPIxx.EXE

              o  SYS$SHARE:DTRAPIxx.OLB

              ________________________Note ________________________

              o  The installation procedure does not append the
                 xx suffix to all images and files. For example,
                 DTR$LIBRARY:TERMSERVE.OLB and SYS$MESSAGE:DTRMSGS.EXE
                 do not get the installation suffix.

              o  DTRAPIxx.EXE resides in SYS$SHARE and you can
                 copy it whenever you need to link it with
                 user programs to create DATATRIEVE client
                 applications. You can also copy DTRAPIxx.EXE
                 to OpenVMS nodes that do not have a registered
                 DATATRIEVE license.

                 No DATATRIEVE license is required for the Client
                 application but only for the server. DTRAPI
                 libraries for the Windows environment are also
                 provided by the DATATRIEVE kit as optional files
                 and can be copied to a Windows environment to
                 create Windows DATATRIEVE Client applications.

              _____________________________________________________

           1.6.5  Check for Invalid DTRFUNxx.OLB

           DATATRIEVE Version 6.1 distributed, and in some cases
           installed, an incorrect DTRFUNxx.OLB library which did not
           contain the object module DTRFND.

           To find out if this applies to your system, you must check
           the DTRFUNxx.OLB library contained in DTR$LIBRARY. If the
           object module DTRFND is not found in the library, you must
           delete DTRFUNxx.OLB before installing DATATRIEVE Version
           7.2A.

           The following example shows how to check for the presence
           of the object module DTRFND in the DTRFUN.OLB and
           DTRFUNORIGINAL.OLB libraries.
           Since DTRFUNORIGINAL.OLB does not contain DTRFND, it will
           have to be deleted before installation.

                                       DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure



              Before you install DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A, make sure that
              your system meets all requirements listed in Chapter 1,
              Preinstallation Considerations.

              Your Version 7.2A installation kit consists of one
              magnetic tape or TK50. This medium makes obsolete the
              distribution media for any lower version of DATATRIEVE.

              DATATRIEVE is also available on CDROM. If you are
              installing DATATRIEVE from CDROM, follow the directions in
              the documentation packaged with the CDROM kit.

              The installation procedure is described in the sections
              that follow. Note that as the procedure progresses, the
              installation command procedure sends questions to your
              screen to guide you through the installation process. The
              sections that follow explain these questions in detail.

              On OpenVMS VAX operating systems, after you answer
              questions from the installation procedure, installation of
              DATATRIEVE takes approximately 20 to 40 minutes. <>

              On OpenVMS Alpha operating systems, after you answer
              questions from the installation procedure, installation of
              DATATRIEVE takes approximately 10 to 20 minutes. <>

        2.1 Starting the Installation Procedure

              To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command
              procedure from a privileged account. VMSINSTAL is in the
              SYS$UPDATE directory. Use the following format to invoke
              VMSINSTAL.

              @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL save-set-name device-name OPTIONS N

                                   DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure 2-1

 



     DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure
     2.1 Starting the Installation Procedure

           save-set-name

           The name of the DATATRIEVE save set you want to install:

           On OpenVMS VAX operating systems, enter DTRA072 to install
           DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A. <>

           On OpenVMS Alpha operating systems, enter DTRAXPA072 to
           install DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A. <>

           device-name

           The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
           media. For example, MTA0: is the device name for a tape
           drive. It is not necessary to use the console drive for
           this installation. However, if you do use the console
           drive, you should replace any media you removed once the
           installation is complete. If you are installing DATATRIEVE
           from a CD, you must specify a device-name and a directory
           name. The directory name should be the same as the save
           set name.

           OPTIONS N

           An optional parameter that indicates you want to review
           the release notes questions (see Section 2.3, Answering
           Questions About Release Notes for more information).

           The following example and the rest of this chapter show
           how to install DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A for OpenVMS VAX
           from CDROM DKA400. This example uses the OPTIONS N release
           note parameter.

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DTRA072 DKA400:[DTRA072] OPTIONS N

           If you do not supply any parameter, VMSINSTAL prompts you
           for the information later in the installation procedure.

           Note that you can specify the AUTOANSWERBACK option
           when you invoke VMSINSTAL. This option creates the file
           SYS$UPDATE:DTRA072.ANS, which contains the installation
           questions and your responses. This file can then be used
           in subsequent installations. (The OpenVMS documentation
           on software installation contains more information about
           VMSINSTAL.)

     2-2 DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure

 



                                       DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure
                                 2.1 Starting the Installation Procedure

              The AUTOANSWERBACK option is not recommended for
              DATATRIEVE installations. Questions asked during
              the DATATRIEVE installation are based on the system
              environment. The system environment at the time of the
              original installation determines which questions the
              installation procedure will ask. When you proceed with
              a subsequent installation, the questions change according
              to changes in the system environment. Thus, if you specify
              AUTOANSWERBACK during the original installation, you
              probably will not receive the appropriate questions during
              the subsequent installation.

              The installation procedure prompts you for input at
              various times. Whenever you are prompted for input, you
              can type a question mark (?) symbol for help.

              Most installation prompts include a default response in
              brackets. To enter the default bracketed response, you can
              either explicitly enter that response or press the RETURN
              key.

              Before the installation procedure begins, VMSINSTAL checks
              if you are logged in to the system account. If not, you
              receive this warning message:

              %VMSINSTAL-W-NOTSYSTEM, You are not logged in to the
              system account.

              In addition, before the installation procedure begins,
              VMSINSTAL checks for active processes on the system. If
              your DECnet network is running, you receive this warning
              message:

              %VMSINSTAL-W-DECNET, Your DECnet network is up and running.

              If there are still users on the system, you receive this
              warning message with a list of process names:

              %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:

                                        .
                                        .
                                        .

              The list of the process names is followed by this
              question:

              * Do you want to continue anyway? [NO]

                                   DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure 2-3

 



     DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure
     2.1 Starting the Installation Procedure

           If you want to stop the installation process to allow all
           users to exit the system, enter N or press the RETURN key.

           At the start of the VMSINSTAL procedure, you need to
           answer the following question:

           * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

           After you have performed the necessary backup, enter
           Y or press the RETURN key. If you reply with N, the
           installation stops.

     2.2 Mounting the Distribution Medium

           You should now mount the first distribution volume on the
           device you specified when you invoked VMSINSTAL.

           VMSINSTAL displays the following message:

           Please mount the first volume of the set on DKA400:

           * Are you ready?

           Type Y after you mount the distribution medium.

           The installation procedure then checks if the following
           necessary conditions for the installation have been
           fulfilled:

           o  The target of the installation is SYS$COMMON on the
              system-rooted device.

           o  A compatible version of OpenVMS is installed.

           o  At least 29,000 blocks are available on the system disk
              (50,000 blocks are required if you install DATATRIEVE
              on OpenVMS Alpha systems).

           If any of these conditions has not been fulfilled, the
           installation procedure displays a message describing
           the problem. After satisfying the requirement, you can
           rerun the installation procedure by invoking the command
           procedure VMSINSTAL again.

           If you choose to install DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A with
           Oracle CDD/Repository support, the installation procedure
           checks whether Oracle CDD/Repository is available on the
           system and if the required version and proper ACL access
           rights are available.

                                    2.2 Mounting the Distribution Medium

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Systems that do not have DECnet cannot support the
                DATATRIEVE remote server. However on systems without
                DECnet, but with TCP/IP software (see list of
                optional software products), the DATATRIEVE remote
                server image (DDMF) can behave as the DATATRIEVE
                Server for DATATRIEVE Client applications using
                the TCP/IP network transport. On such systems,
                the installation procedure next displays a message
                noting that it cannot define a DECnet object for the
                remote server. If you later install DECnet, you will
                then need to define a DECnet object for the remote
                server. See Section 3.6, DECnet Considerations for
                more information.

                _____________________________________________________

              This ends the initial series of questions generated by
              VMSINSTAL. If you have successfully completed this portion
              of the installation, a message similar to the following is
              displayed:

              The following products will be processed:

              DTRA Version 7.2

               Beginning installation of DTRA Version 7.2 at 8:15

              VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

              The installation continues with questions about release
              notes.

        2.3 Answering Questions About Release Notes

              If you specified the qualifier OPTIONS N at the beginning
              of the installation, the procedure offers these options
              regarding DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A online release notes:

              Release Notes Options:

              1.  Display release notes
              2.  Print release notes
              3.  Both 1 and 2
              4.  Do not display, print or copy release notes

     2.4 Answering Questions About Oracle CDD/Repository

           DATATRIEVE removed the dependency from Oracle CDD/Repository
           by supporting a new textfile-based dictionary in addition
           to Oracle CDD/Repository. At installation time you will
           be asked whether you want to link DATATRIEVE with Oracle
           CDD/Repository or not:

           * Do you want support for Oracle CDD/Repository [Yes]?

           If you type Yes you can dynamically enable and disable
           Oracle CDD/Repository at run time. If you type No, Oracle
           CDD/Repository will not be supported and it cannot be
           enabled at run time.

     2.5 Answering Questions About the DATATRIEVE object libraries
         (OpenVMS VAX systems only)

           DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A is built using several object
           libraries which can also be used to customize DATATRIEVE.
           On OpenVMS VAX systems, up to DATATRIEVE version Version
           7.2A, the object modules in these libraries have been
           built with the VAX C compiler. The installation procedure
           now asks whether you wish to install the product using
           the object libraries built with the VAX C compiler or the

              ordinary user. This only affects those users who program
              their own customizations in the C language on OpenVMS VAX
              systems and relink DTRSHR.exe.

                  The DATATRIEVE product is built using several object
                  libraries which can also be used to customize DATATRIEVE
                  to suit your needs (see theDATATRIEVE documentation manual,
                  'Guide to Programming and Customizing').   These object libraries
                  are now built using the DEC C compiler.    If you have been
                  programming your own customizations and wish to continue using the
                  VAX C compiler, you have the option of installing the object
                  libraries which have been built using that compiler instead.

                  If you answer YES to this question, DATATRIEVE will be
                  linked with the VAX C RTL, and the libraries in DTR$LIBRARY will
                  contain objects built with the VAX C compiler.

                  If you answer NO to this question, DATATRIEVE will be
                  linked with the DEC C RTL, and the libraries in DTR$LIBRARY will
                  contain objects built with DEC C compiler.

                  Unless you customize your use of DATATRIEVE and want to
                  continue using the VAX C compiler for your own customizations,
                  answer NO to this question:

              * Do you want to install DATATRIEVE using object libraries built with
                the VAX C compiler[NO]?

        You should accept the default answer unless you wish to continue
        compiling your customizations with the VAX C compiler.<>

            (LMF)

              DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A supports the License Management
              facility provided by OpenVMS. The installation procedure
              asks whether you have registered and loaded a Product
              Authorization Key (PAK) as required.

           * Does this product have an authorization key registered
           and loaded?

           If you answer Y or YES, the procedure continues. If you
           answer N or NO, you receive the following message:

           You have not registered the LMF authorization key as required.
           The DATATRIEVE installation will continue.  However, you
           cannot run the product until you register the license
           authorization key.

           When the DATATRIEVE installation is completed, please
           register the authorization key using the following command:

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE

           The IVP cannot be run until the authorization key is registered.
           However, the IVP command file will be put in the same directory
           as the UETPs.  Once you register the authorization key, you may
           run the IVP by entering DATATRIEVE and issuing the following
           command:

           @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR]DTR$IVP.COM

           The installation continues with a series of DATATRIEVE
           questions.

     2.7 Answering Questions During the DATATRIEVE Installation

           The installation procedure asks you a number of questions
           concerning default installation, forms management
           products, multiple DATATRIEVE installations, and
           DATATRIEVE files. The following sections give examples
           of these questions.

              2.7 Answering Questions During the DATATRIEVE Installation

              2.7.1 Installing DATATRIEVE with the Default Answers

              The installation procedure now asks if you want to install
              DATATRIEVE using default answers for all questions.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                While this question may simplify the installation
                procedure, it may not be appropriate for your
                situation. For example, if your system supports more
                than one installation of this version of DATATRIEVE,
                you should not select the default installation
                option. Read the summary of the default responses
                that follows the question before you choose this
                option.

                _____________________________________________________

              The installation procedure prompts you with the following
              question:

              *Do you want to use default answers for all questions [Yes]?

              If you type Y, the DATATRIEVE installation procedure
              automatically does the following:

              o  Performs a complete installation of DATATRIEVE; it will
                 not allow a partial installation to provide DATATRIEVE
                 support for LSE.

              o  Checks your system for a forms management product
                 (Compaq FMS or VAX TDMS). If DATATRIEVE does not
                 find either of them, the automatic installation
                 procedure provides support only for DECforms, if this
                 is available on the system.

                 If either Compaq FMS or VAX TDMS already exists on the
                 system, DATATRIEVE in addition to DECforms support:

                 -  Supplies Compaq FMS support, if only Compaq FMS is
                    on the system

                 -  Supplies VAX TDMS support, if only VAX TDMS is on
                    the system

                 -  Supplies VAX TDMS support, if both Compaq FMS and
                    VAX TDMS are found on the system

     DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure
     2.7 Answering Questions During the DATATRIEVE Installation

           o  Does not prompt you for the unique 1- to 26-character
              suffix that identifies the DTR32xx.EXE image of this
              installation. Note that if you have already installed
              this version of DATATRIEVE and did not supply a suffix
              during that installation, you will need a suffix to
              differentiate the image of the previous installation
              from the image currently being installed. In such
              a case, the default installation procedure is not
              appropriate.

           o  Does not prompt you for the default image to be used
              with the DATATRIEVE DCL command and DCL help. The
              default image will be DTR32.

           o  Checks if the DATATRIEVE remote server has been
              defined by a previous installation of DATATRIEVE. The
              DATATRIEVE remote server is called the Distributed Data
              Manipulation Facility (DDMF).

              When the installation procedure checks for a previously
              defined DDMF:

              -  If there is no remote server or if the remote server
                 is obsolete, the DDMF files from this installation
                 become the remote server for DATATRIEVE.

              -  If there is a current remote server already on the
                 system, the default installation procedure uses
                 that as the remote server for this installation of
                 DATATRIEVE.

           o  Copies the NEWUSER.COM file in DTR$LIBRARY.

           o  Checks the status of the DCL help for DATATRIEVE. If
              DCL help is unavailable or out-of-date, DATATRIEVE
              automatically updates DCL help.

           o  Installs DTRSHR.EXE, DTRMSGS.EXE, DTR32.EXE, and
              DDMF.EXE (if applicable) as SHARED.

           o  Installs DTRHELP as SHARED.

           o  Supplies the plot definitions for the current version.

           o  Does not supply the optional text and message files,
              sample programs, and callable programming aids that can
              be tailored at the installed site.

              If you type N, the installation procedure continues with
              the questions about LSE.

              2.7.2 Installing with LSE Support

              To use LSE with DATATRIEVE , LSE must already be installed
              and licensed on your system. If LSE is not already
              installed on your system, you see the following message on
              your screen:

                  *********************************************************

                  The LSE Editor is not installed on your
                  system.  To have LSE support, you must:

                      1.  Install the LSE Editor
                      2.  Install or reinstall this product

                  *********************************************************

              * Do you want to continue the installation [No]?

              If you enter Y or YES, the installation continues;
              however, you will not be able to use LSE with DATATRIEVE.
              If you enter the default value by entering N, NO, or
              by pressing the RETURN key, the installation aborts,
              giving you the opportunity to install LSE on your system.
              Once LSE is installed, you can begin the DATATRIEVE
              installation procedure from the beginning. If LSE is
              already installed on your system, you will be prompted
              with the following:

                  LSE is installed on your system.

                  You now have the following options:

                       1.  Do a complete DATATRIEVE installation including
                           DATATRIEVE support for LSE.

                       2.  Do only DATATRIEVE support for LSE without
                           installing DATATRIEVE.

                       3.  Do a DATATRIEVE installation without including
                           DATATRIEVE support for LSE.

     2.7 Answering Questions During the DATATRIEVE Installation

           If you want to install a new version of DATATRIEVE
           (including LSE support), select option 1. If you want only
           to provide DATATRIEVE support for LSE (without installing
           a new version of DATATRIEVE), select option 2. If you
           want to install a new version of DATATRIEVE without LSE
           support, select option 3. If you select option 2, this
           installation will terminate after DATATRIEVE support for
           LSE is provided.

           2.7.3  Installing with Support for Forms Products

           Each installation of DATATRIEVE on a system can support
           two forms management products:

           o  DECforms

           o  Compaq FMS (Forms Management System) or VAX TDMS
              (Terminal Data Management System)

           DECforms software is dynamically loaded at runtime and
           no specific operations are required at installation
           time. This means that DECforms, whenever installed on
           the system, is always available, while Compaq FMS and
           VAX TDMS are optional and mutually exclusive. You select
           Compaq FMS or VAX TDMS at installation time.

           A series of questions determines which product DATATRIEVE
           will support for the image currently being installed.

           The installation procedure checks which forms management
           products are on the system. If no forms products are found
           (or only lower versions of VAX TDMS or Compaq FMS not
           supported by DATATRIEVE are found), the installation
           procedure displays the following message:

                  *********************************************************

                  Neither Compaq FMS nor VAX TDMS product has been found
                  on this system. If desired, the installation may be
                  aborted at this point to install either Compaq FMS or
                  VAX TDMS.

                  If the installation continues, DATATRIEVE
                  will be built with DECforms support only.
                  The DECforms support will be automatically available,
                  provided that DECforms is installed and licensed by
                  the time DATATRIEVE is invoked.

                  *********************************************************

              * Do you wish to continue with the installation [YES]?

              If you type Y or press the RETURN key, the installation
              continues with the series of questions about more than
              one installation of this version of DATATRIEVE. (See
              Section 2.7.4, Specifying Suffixes for More than One
              Installation of This Version of DATATRIEVE for more
              information.)

              If you type N, the installation aborts, giving you an
              opportunity to install a forms product on your system.

              If one or more forms products are found, you receive a
              listing of the products on your system, followed by a
              message and question similar to the following:

                  DATATRIEVE can be built to support any one
                  of these products, or, if desired, DATATRIEVE
                  can be built without support of any of these Forms
                  Management products.

              * Do you want DATATRIEVE to support one of these
              products [YES]?

              If you do not want forms support, enter N. The installa-
              tion procedure resumes with questions on suffixes and more
              than one installation of this version of DATATRIEVE.

              If you do want forms support, enter Y or press the RETURN
              key. Then, for each forms product on the system, you
              are asked if you want DATATRIEVE to support this forms
              product. Remember each installation of DATATRIEVE can
              support only one forms product in addition to DECforms.

     DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure
     2.7 Answering Questions During the DATATRIEVE Installation

           After you enter Y to specify support for one forms
           product, you do not receive questions about the other
           forms products.

           For example, if you have both VAX TDMS and Compaq FMS on
           the system, you receive the following question first:

           * Do you wish to have VAX TDMS Forms Management support [YES]?

           If you type Y or press the RETURN key, the DATATRIEVE
           image being installed will support VAX TDMS. Then the
           installation procedure moves on to a series of questions
           on suffixes and more than one installation of this version
           of DATATRIEVE.

           If you type N, you receive a question about support for
           Compaq FMS.

           If you type N after each question in the series, you
           receive the following message:

               There are neither Compaq FMS nor VAX TDMS Forms
               Management products on this system. If desired, the
               installation may be aborted at this point to install
               either Compaq FMS or VAX TDMS. If the installation
               continues, the questions pertaining to the selection of
               a Forms Management product will be asked again.

           * Do you wish to continue with the installation [YES]?

           If you type Y or press the RETURN key, you have another
           opportunity to answer questions about forms. If you type
           N, the installation procedure aborts.

           of This Version of DATATRIEVE

           The installation procedure asks whether you intend to

                  It is possible to do more than one installation of
                  DATATRIEVE.  More than one installation of a
                  single version may be desirable for a number of reasons
                  including:

                      o  Use of multiple forms management products (such as
                         Compaq FMS and VAX TDMS; DECforms is available in
                         every image, if present on the system)

                      o  Use of multiple foreign language translations of
                         DATATRIEVE (such as French or German)

              * Do you plan to install this version more than once [NO]?

              If you type N or press the RETURN key, the installation
              procedure continues with questions about retaining
              DATATRIEVE files. (See Section 3.5, Online DATATRIEVE
              Object Library for more information.) At a later date, you
              can decide to install DATATRIEVE using file names other
              than the defaults by typing Y in response to the previous
              question.

              If you type Y, the installation procedure displays
              messages requesting that you specify a suffix for the
              image you are installing and the default image for the DCL
              command DATATRIEVE.

              The following message and question about the suffix are
              displayed:

                  To differentiate the files and images produced by this
                  installation from those produced by some other
                  DATATRIEVE installation, it is necessary to append a
                  suffix to some of the file and image names. For each
                  installation of this version of DATATRIEVE, this suffix
                  should be unique. This suffix can be 1 to 26 characters.

              * What is the suffix you intend to use for this
              installation [none]?

              Only one set of DATATRIEVE images and files can use
              the default file names that have no suffix. (See
              Section 1.6.4, More than One Installation of this Version
              of DATATRIEVE for a list of these images and files.)
              If you install this version of DATATRIEVE a second or
              subsequent time, you should identify the subsequent image
              and file names by a unique suffix. This step allows you

     2.7 Answering Questions During the DATATRIEVE Installation

           later to identify which version of DATATRIEVE you want to
           run.

           For example, on the first run through the installation
           procedure, you could respond to the question about the
           suffix by pressing the RETURN key. The result is that each
           of the DATATRIEVE file names includes no suffix. To run
           the image produced by this procedure, type:

           $ DATATRIEVE

           During the second or subsequent installation of this
           version of DATATRIEVE, for example, you might use VAX
           TDMS as the forms product supported by this image. You
           could identify the files and images by responding with
           VAX TDMS for the suffix. To run the image produced by this
           procedure, type the following line:

           $ DATATRIEVE/VARIANT=XX

           For the remainder of this manual, the two letters xx at
           the end of a file name stand for the 1- to 26-character
           suffix you specify.

           If you specify the same suffix for a later installation,
           the later image supersedes the previous image installed
           with the same suffix. If you choose to purge files during
           the installation, those earlier images will be deleted.
           See Section 2.7.9, Purging Files for more information.

           The following message and question are displayed:

               The DATATRIEVE DCL command allows you to choose which DTR32
               image to execute by means of the /VARIANT qualifier.  You
               may now choose an image to be executed by default, when the
               /VARIANT qualifier is not specified on the DATATRIEVE
               command. This default image will be the image referenced
               by DCL HELP.

           DTR32, DTR32xx

           * Which of the above images should be the default [DTR32xx]:

           The installation procedure checks which DATATRIEVE images
           are on the system. All existing image names, plus the name
           of the image you are currently installing, are listed. The
           current image name is provided as the default response to
           the question.

                                       DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure
              2.7 Answering Questions During the DATATRIEVE Installation

              Only one DATATRIEVE image can be chosen as the default
              for the DCL command DATATRIEVE. You must use the /VARIANT
              qualifier to invoke any other DATATRIEVE image using the
              DCL command DATATRIEVE.

              For example, on the first run through the installation
              procedure, you could respond to both the question about
              the suffix and the question about the DCL default by
              pressing the RETURN key. The result is that the image name
              is DTR32 and that image is the default when you invoke
              DATATRIEVE using the DCL command DATATRIEVE as follows:

              $ DATATRIEVE

              During the second or subsequent installation of this
              version of DATATRIEVE, you might choose VAX TDMS as the
              suffix. You might then choose DTR32 as the default image
              name with the DCL command DATATRIEVE. You can use the
              DCL command DATATRIEVE to invoke the DTR32TDMS image as
              follows:

              $ DATATRIEVE/VARIANT=TDMS

              If, however, you choose DTR32TDMS as the default with the
              DATATRIEVE DCL command, you must use the VARIANT qualifier
              to invoke the DTR32 image as follows:

              $ DATATRIEVE/VARIANT

              2.7.5 Defining the DATATRIEVE Remote Server

              The installation procedure checks if the DATATRIEVE remote
              server has been defined by previous installations of
              DATATRIEVE. The remote server for DATATRIEVE is called the
              Distributed Data Manipulation Facility (DDMF). Although
              there can be several shareable images of DATATRIEVE
              installed on the same system, there can be only one remote
              server for each system.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                You do not receive the question discussed in this
                section if you are installing DATATRIEVE on a
                OpenVMS system without DECnet. If you later install
                DECnet, you then need to define a DECnet object
                for the remote server. See Section 3.6, DECnet

                                  DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure 2-17

 



     DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure
     2.7 Answering Questions During the DATATRIEVE Installation

              Considerations for more information on defining a
              DECnet object.

              _____________________________________________________

           If no remote server has been defined previously or if a
           previously-defined remote server is obsolete, the DDMF
           files from this installation become the remote server for
           DATATRIEVE on the system. You do not receive a question
           about the remote server, and the installation procedure
           continues with questions about the file for new users. See
           Section 2.7.6, Creating a DCL Command File for New Users
           for more information.

           However, if an up-to-date remote server has already been
           defined (by a previous installation of this DATATRIEVE
           release, for example), the installation procedure
           asks if the remote server established by the current
           installation should be the remote server for the system.
           The DECnet object number for DDMF is defined as 30 by
           the installation procedure. You receive the following
           question:

           * Do you want DDMFxx.EXE to be used for distributed access [NO]?

           Type Y if you want the remote server (DDMF) established
           by the current installation to be the remote server for
           your system. You might want to type Y if this image will
           contain options that users on remote systems need to
           access frequently, for example, user-defined functions
           that PDP-11 users need to access. In such cases, it is
           more efficient to make the remote server file for this
           image the remote server for your system.

           Type N or press the RETURN key if these considerations do
           not apply to this installation of DATATRIEVE.

           2.7.6  Creating a DCL Command File for New Users

           The installation procedure now copies the new user
           file, NEWUSER.COM, to DTR$LIBRARY. NEWUSER.COM helps
           new users get started with DATATRIEVE by providing the
           necessary files to perform the examples in the DATATRIEVE
           documentation set. Users can invoke the NEWUSER command
           file by entering:

              2.7 Answering Questions During the DATATRIEVE Installation

              $ @DTR$LIBRARY:NEWUSER

              This procedure copies the DATATRIEVE data files from
              DTR$LIBRARY to your directory and creates the DATATRIEVE
              objects in your Oracle CDD/Repository dictionary (when
              Oracle CDD/Repository support is available) or in a user-
              specified OpenVMS directory.

              2.7.7 Installing Shared Images

              DATATRIEVE runs most efficiently when all its executable
              images are installed as shareable images. The installation
              procedure lets you choose not to do so, however. The
              installation procedure prompts you with the following
              question. Note that the file SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM is
              built according to your responses.

              * Do you want DTRSHRxx.EXE and DTRMSGS.EXE to be installed
              SHARED [YES]?

              For best performance, the images DTRSHRxx.EXE and
              DTRMSGS.EXE should be installed as SHARED. Type Y or press
              the RETURN key if you want these images to be installed as
              SHARED.

              The second question about shareable images refers to
              DTR32xx.EXE. For best performance, this should also be
              installed as SHARED.

              * Do you want DTR32xx.EXE to be installed SHARED [YES]?

              Type Y or press the RETURN key if you want this image to
              be installed SHARED.

              For best performance in environments where you anticipate
              extensive use of the distributed features of DATATRIEVE,
              the image DDMFxx.EXE should also be installed as SHARED.
              If the DDMF from this installation is to be the remote
              server, you receive the following question:

              * Do you want DDMFxx.EXE to be installed SHARED [YES]?

              Type Y or press the RETURN key if you want this image to
              be installed as SHARED.

     2.7 Answering Questions During the DATATRIEVE Installation

              ________________________Note ________________________

              You do not receive the question about DDMFxx.EXE if
              you are installing DATATRIEVE on a system that does
              not have DECnet. If you later install DECnet, see
              Section 3.6, DECnet Considerations for instructions
              on running the DDMFxx.EXE image as SHARED.

              _____________________________________________________

           2.7.8  Installing Plot Definitions and Optional Material

           The installation procedure continues with a question about
           plot definitions for DATATRIEVE graphics. DATATRIEVE
           contains graphics features you can use with a VT125,
           VT240, VT330, or VT340 terminal or on a workstation. To
           use these features, you must request plot definitions
           during installation.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              If this is your first installation of DATATRIEVE
              since Version 3.4, you must answer Y to the
              following question. The plot definitions were
              modified with Version 4.0. Plot definitions provided
              with DATATRIEVE installations prior to Version 4.0
              are not compatible with DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A.

              _____________________________________________________

           The following question is displayed:

           * Do you wish to have the plot definitions [YES]?

           Type Y or press the RETURN key if you want the instal-
           lation procedure to include plot definitions. The plot
           definitions are installed in a Oracle CDD/Repository DMU
           dictionary, in CDD$TOP.DTR$LIB.PLOTS when DEC DATATRIEVE
           is installed with Oracle CDD/Repository support. Their
           textfile definitions to be used when CDD/Repository
           support is not available or disabled are copied to
           SYS$SYSDEVICE:[VMS$COMMON.DTR.DTR$LIB.PLOTS].

           The next question pertains to components of DATATRIEVE
           that can be tailored at the installation site. This
           optional material includes Data Access Blocks files
           (used with Callable DATATRIEVE), the DATATRIEVE message

              sample programs and the files necessary for creating and
              maintaining user-defined functions.

              The following message and question are displayed:

                  Some optional material is available with this kit including
                  the components of DATATRIEVE that can be tailored at
                  the installed site.

              * Do you want the optional material [NO]?

              Type Y if you want this material. The installation
              procedure loads these files in DTR$LIBRARY. If you do
              not want this material, type N or press the RETURN key.

              After you respond to this question, the installation
              procedure continues with a question about purging files
              replaced by the installation procedure.

              2.7.9 Purging Files

              The installation procedure continues with the following
              question:

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

              If you wish, you can have all files that were created
              by this installation procedure purged in the various
              directories where they were created. No files are purged
              except those created in this installation. Type Y or press
              the RETURN key to purge the files.

              2.7.10 Running the IVP

              The last question regarding the installation concerns
              the IVP. You can choose whether to run the IVP after the
              installation or not. The following message is displayed:

             The DATATRIEVE IVP will be put in the
             SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR] directory. You may run the IVP
             immediately after the completion of the installation procedure
             answering YES to the next question or later issuing the
             following command:

             @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR]DTR$IVP.COM DTRxx.EXE

           * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?
           * Proceed with this installation [YES]?

              ________________________Note ________________________

              The PAK must be registered before either the IVP or
              any of the UETPs can be run. If you answered no to
              the following question, the message about IVP will
              not be displayed and the IVP will not be run at this
              time:

              * Does this product have an authorization key registered
              and loaded?

     2.8 Finishing the Installation

           If you did not request the default installation, the
           following message is displayed:

               All questions regarding the installation have now been asked.

               The installation of DATATRIEVE will now continue for
               20 minutes to 40 minutes.

           If the DTRFNDxx.MAR file provided by this installation
           is newer than an existing one, the installation procedure
           will display the following message:

           An existing DTRFNDxx.MAR has been found
           on the system, but its version does not
           match the current level for this installation.
           The existing DTRFNDxx.MAR and DTRFUNxx.OLB
           have been respectively renamed to
           DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFNDxx.OLD and

              During installation, you should receive the following
              message:

                  During the installation, a file called
                  DTRSTUPxx.COM has been added to SYS$STARTUP:
                  The site-dependent startup file, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM,
                  should have the following line added:

                       $ @SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM

              Be sure to update SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM after
              installation.

              On OpenVMS VAX systems Version 5.4 or earlier, the file
              SYSTARTUP.COM is called SYSTARTUP_V5.COM. <>

              The installation procedure next displays information about
              User Environment Test Packages (UETPs). The installation
              provides up to five UETPs, depending on the optional
              products already on the system ( VAX TDMS, Compaq FMS,
              Oracle CODASYL DBMS, Oracle Rdb) and your responses to
              the questions about forms products and plots. Besides
              a general test of DATATRIEVE, there are also UETPs for
              plots, forms, Oracle Rdb, and Oracle CODASYL DBMS.

              The installation displays a message showing how to invoke
              each UETP it provides:

           DATATRIEVE User Environment Test Packages (UETPs)
           have been provided and can be run after the installation is
           complete.  They are invoked from DATATRIEVE as follows:

           DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]DTR   ! The general test
           DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]plots ! The plots test
           DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]dbms  ! The Oracle CODASYL DBMS test
           DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]rdb   ! The Oracle Rdb test
           DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]forms ! The Forms test

           Before invoking these files from a user's account you must
           execute the procedure :
             @DTR$LIBRARY:NEWUSER.COM
           This procedure loads the DATATRIEVE definitions into the
           user's dictionary and the data files in the user's directory.
           This procedure must be executed by each user needing
           the DATATRIEVE examples.
           *************************************************************

           The file type for the UETP files in the directory
           SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR] is .DTR.

           Chapter 4, User Environment Test Packages discusses the
           test packages.

           The installation procedure now runs the general IVP test
           and, if you chose to run the IVP after the installation,
           it displays the following message:

           Executing IVP for:  DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A

           Running the general IVP test...
               Test completed successfully

                                         Postinstallation Considerations



              This chapter discusses some important postinstallation
              considerations concerning DECnet, operating systems,
              relational databases, Oracle CODASYL DBMS databases,
              and user-defined functions. This chapter also contains
              information on installing DATATRIEVE Client for Windows.

        3.1 Updating SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM

              During installation, a file called DTRSTUPxx.COM was added
              to SYS$STARTUP. Note that xx represents the 1- to 26-
              character suffix you specify during installation. After
              installation, you must update the site-dependent startup
              file SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM by adding the following
              line:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM

        3.2 VAXcluster Considerations (VAX Only)

              If you are installing DATATRIEVE on a VAXcluster, the
              shareable image created by this installation of DATATRIEVE
              is available only from the node where the installation is
              done. Therefore, after the installation is complete, you
              should repeat the following steps on each of the other
              nodes in the VAXcluster where DATATRIEVE will be used:

              1. Issue the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the OpenVMS
                 license.

              2. Execute the DATATRIEVE startup command file as follows:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM

     Postinstallation Considerations
     3.2 VAXcluster Considerations (VAX Only)

           3. Install the new version of DCLTABLES.EXE that has been
              updated to include the DCL command DATATRIEVE. Install
              the file as follows:

              $ INSTALL
              INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES

           The second step is not necessary if you plan to reboot the
           entire VAXcluster after the installation is complete.

     3.3 Moving the DATATRIEVE Environment Between Operating Systems

           To move your DATATRIEVE environment from an OpenVMS VAX
           system to an OpenVMS Alpha system, do the following:

           o  Copy all DATATRIEVE data files and procedures to the
              other system.

           o  If your application programs use the DATATRIEVE Call
              Interface, or if you have customized DATATRIEVE by
              modifying certain source files, you must recompile
              and relink the application programs and the DATATRIEVE
              customization source files.

           o  For DATATRIEVE related products (for example, Oracle
              CDD/Repository, DECforms), refer to their specific
              documentation.

           o  To migrate OpenVMS VAX applications calling DATATRIEVE
              via the DEC Migrate utility (VEST), refer to the DEC
              DATATRIEVE V7.1 Release Notes.

     3.4 Updating Process Command Tables

           The DATATRIEVE installation creates a new version of
           DCLTABLES.EXE including the DCL command DATATRIEVE. To
           use the DCL command DATATRIEVE, users must log out of
           their processes and log back in to update their process
           command tables.

        3.5 Online DATATRIEVE Object Library

              The installation keeps the library online in case it is
              necessary to relink a DATATRIEVE image.

              You may have to relink DATATRIEVE if you:

              o  Add a user-defined function (however it is possible to
                 add user functions stored in shareable images without
                 relinking DEC DATATRIEVE).

              o  Customize the text file DTRTEXT.MAR.

              o  Install or patch a new version of Oracle CDD/Repository.
                 (Check the Oracle CDD/Repository documentation to see
                 if relinking is necessary.) This only applies if DEC
                 DATATRIEVE was installed with the Oracle CDD/Repository
                 support.

              o  Install a new version of the OpenVMS Run-Time Library.

              o  Install a new version of Compaq FMS.

              You may enter the following command to relink DATATRIEVE:

              $ @DTR$LIBRARY:DTRBLDxx

        3.6 DECnet Considerations

              This section describes what you need to do to run the
              DATATRIEVE remote server if DECnet is installed after
              DATATRIEVE on a OpenVMS system. It also describes how
              to create a default DECnet account for remote users of
              DATATRIEVE on your system.

              3.6.1 Defining a DECnet Object

              DECnet is normally installed on a OpenVMS system. Unless
              you install DATATRIEVE on a OpenVMS system without DECnet,
              the installation procedure automatically defines a DECnet
              object for the DATATRIEVE remote server.

              However, if you install DATATRIEVE on a OpenVMS system
              that does not have DECnet, the installation procedure
              cannot use the DECnet Network Control Program (NCP)

     Postinstallation Considerations
     3.6 DECnet Considerations

           utility[1], or the Network Control Language (NCL)
           utility[2] to define a DECnet object.

           This section describes how to use NCP and NCL to define a
           DECnet object for the remote server if DECnet is installed
           on your system after DATATRIEVE is installed.

           The remote server for DATATRIEVE is called the Distributed
           Data Manipulation Facility (DDMF). The installation
           procedure creates two files, DDMFxx.EXE and DDMFxx.COM,
           in SYS$SYSTEM. In a DECnet Phase IV network, to define
           a DECnet object for DDMFxx.EXE and assign it an object
           number of 30, type the following commands:

           $ NCP == "$NCP"
           $ NCP DEFINE OBJECT DDMF NUMBER 30
           $ NCP SET OBJECT DDMF NUMBER 30
           $ NCP DEFINE OBJECT DDMF FILE DDMFxx.COM
           $ NCP SET OBJECT DDMF FILE DDMFxx.COM

           In a DECnet/OSI network, to define a DECnet object for
           DDMFxx.EXE and assign it an object number of 30, type the
           following commands:

           $ NCL == "$NCL"
           $ NCL CREATE SESSION CONTROL APPLICATION DDMF
           $ NCL SET SESSION CONTROL APPLICATION DDMF ADDRESS=(NUMBER=30)
           $ NCL SET SESSION CONTROL APPLICATION DDMF IMAGE NAME=DDMFxx.COM

           Note that, in a DECnet/OSI network, if the account used
           to perform the DATATRIEVE installation does not have the
           NET$MANAGE right identifier, you cannot create the DDMF
           session control application. Therefore you must use the
           Authorize Utility to grant the installing account the
           NET$MANAGE access right:

           UAF> GRANT/ID NET$MANAGE account-name

           In the example "account-name" is the name of the account
           used to perform the DATATRIEVE installation.

           ___________________
           [1]       For DECnet Phase IV environments, you use the
                     Network Control Program to configure, control,

                     monitor, and test the network.
           [2]       For DECnet/OSI environments, you use the Network

                     Control Language to perform the same tasks.

                                         Postinstallation Considerations
                                               3.6 DECnet Considerations

              The procedure to grant the correct DECnet/OSI identifiers
              is explained in more details in DECnet/OSI Network
              Management.

              For best performance in environments where you anticipate
              extensive use of the distributed features of DATATRIEVE,
              you should run the remote server as SHARED. To run
              the image DDMFxx.EXE as a SHARED image, edit the file
              SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM. This file begins with the
              following lines:

              $!+
              $!   DATATRIEVE Start-up File
              $!-

              Check the file for the following line and add it if it is
              not already there:

              $ DTR$INSTALL := $SYS$SYSTEM:INSTALL/COMMAND_MODE

              You will see a dollar sign and the word exit at the end
              of the file. Enter the following text on the line above $
              exit:

              ADD/OPEN/SHARED SYS$SYSTEM:DDMFxx.EXE

              3.6.2 Creating a Default DECnet Account for Distributed
              Access

              The installation procedure defines a DECnet object called
              DDMF and assigns it the number 30. After the installation,
              you may want to create a default DECnet account, such
              as DTR$DECNET, for this DECnet object. Remote users
              can then omit the user name and password from the node
              specification when accessing domains on your node.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                This section applies to systems on which DECnet
                was installed before DATATRIEVE. If DATATRIEVE is
                installed on a OpenVMS system that does not have
                DECnet, you cannot define a default DECnet account.
                If DECnet is installed afterwards, you must define
                a DECnet object (see Section 3.6.1, Defining a
                DECnet Object before you can create a default DECnet
                account.

     Postinstallation Considerations
     3.6 DECnet Considerations



           If you wish to set up such a default DECnet account for
           distributed access, follow these steps:

           1. Add an entry to the user authorization file (UAF)
              on your system for DTR$DECNET. Specify the same file
              limits and quotas as you would for any other DATATRIEVE
              user.

           2. Invoke NCP (or NCL) to associate DDMF (known object
              30) with the default DECnet account DTR$DECNET. Use the
              DEFINE OBJECT command in NCP (or the CREATE/SET SESSION
              CONTROL APPLICATION command in NCL) to modify the
              object parameters for DDMF in the permanent database on
              your system.

           You can use the following sample session as a model for
           your own system. Note that for security reasons, you
           should use a different password than the one provided.
           Also note that the UIC used in the sample session is used
           to illustrate the command; you should use a UIC that is
           appropriate for your system.

           OpenVMS Programming and the DECnet for OpenVMS Networking
           Manual.

           As always, when working in a remote, or networking
           environment, follow the security guidelines described
           in the Guide to VMS System Security.

     3.7 Maintaining User-Defined Functions

           If this is your first installation of DATATRIEVE since
           Version 4.1, and if your site maintains site-specific or
           user-defined functions, you should complete the following
           steps to re-enable user-defined functions.

           After an initial installation of DATATRIEVE Version 4.2
           or higher, DATATRIEVE will always use the DTRFNDxx.MAR
           and DTRFUNxx.OLB files that are on the system. You will

                                  3.7 Maintaining User-Defined Functions

              no longer have to re-create and relink DATATRIEVE as
              described in this section.

              1. Transfer the user-defined function definitions
                 from DTRFNDxx.OLD (renamed during installation) to
                 DTRFNDxx.MAR. To do this, edit DTRFNDxx.MAR and add the
                 appropriate definitions. (Merely renaming the old file
                 does not enable user-defined functions in the file.
                 They must be transferred to DTRFNDxx.MAR.)

              2. Assemble DTRFNDxx.MAR with the MACRO command:

                 $ MACRO DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFNDxx.MAR

                 This command creates the object file DTRFNDxx.OBJ.

              3. Replace the object module in the function library with
                 the newly created object file:

                 $ LIBRARY/REPLACE DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFUNxx DTRFNDxx

              4. Skip to the next step if the user-defined functions for
                 your site consist only of calls to OpenVMS Run-Time
                 Library routines. However, if your site has user-
                 defined functions that call their own routines, there
                 is an additional step before relinking DATATRIEVE.
                 The object files for those functions routines must be
                 inserted into the new version of the function library.

                 There are two ways to do this:

                 o  If the object files (.OBJ files) for the routines
                    are still available, insert them directly into the
                    function library:

                    $ LIBRARY/INSERT -
                    _$    DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFUNxx.OLB filename.OBJ

                 o  If the object files for the routines are not
                    available, extract the modules from the old function
                    library before inserting them into the new:

                    $ LIBRARY/EXTRACT=module-name/OUTPUT=filename.OBJ -
                    _$    DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFUNxx.OLD
                    $ LIBRARY/INSERT -
                    _$    DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFUNxx.OLB filename.OBJ

              ________________________Note ________________________


              o  If your site maintains no user-defined functions,
                 you may choose to delete the .OLD files.

              o  DATATRIEVE is no longer linked with the Compaq
                 Fortran Runtime Library.

     3.8 Providing Control Information to DATATRIEVE

           The logical name DTR$ENVIRONMENT provides control
           information to the DATATRIEVE image.

           The equivalence name of DTR$ENVIRONMENT is a string that
           concatenates qualifiers. Currently, only the qualifiers
           /EXIT_ON_PRINT_ERROR and /NOCDD are defined. If the
           equivalence name of DTR$ENVIRONMENT exists and it contains
           the string qualifier /EXIT_ON_PRINT_ERROR, the DATATRIEVE
           interactive image exits when an abnormal condition is met
           while printing output lines. See the following example:

           $ DATATRIEVE "SHOW CDD$DEFAULT.P1"

           PROCEDURE P1
           READY CDD$TOP.DTR$LIB.DEMO.YACHTS ;
           FOR YACHTS
                   BEGIN
                   PRINT TYPE ;
                   FN$WAIT(1) ;
                   END ;

              If the equivalence name of DTR$ENVIRONMENT exists and it
              contains the string qualifier /NOCDD, DATATRIEVE starts
              without using the Oracle CDD/Repository dictionary, even
              if the DATATRIEVE image had been linked with the Oracle
              CDD/Repository image at installation time.

        3.9 Preparing to Install DATATRIEVE Client for Windows

              During installation of DATATRIEVE a file called DTRWN11A.ZIP
              is added to SYS$COMMON:[DTR]. This zip file contains the
              image files required to install DATATRIEVE Client for
              Windows.

              To prepare the disks used to install DATATRIEVE client for
              Windows, use the following steps:

              1. Copy the zip file DTRWN11A.ZIP onto your PC drive.

     Postinstallation Considerations
     3.9 Preparing to Install DATATRIEVE Client for Windows

           2. Unzip the file. This creates three image files and one
              DOS file as follows:

              o  DTRWDSK1.IMG

              o  DTRWDSK2.IMG

              o  DTRWDSK3.IMG

              o  DOSIMAGE.EXE

              You must copy each image file onto a separate floppy
              disk. These three disks are then used to install
              DATATRIEVE Client for Windows.

           3. Insert a blank floppy disk into the disk drive.

           4. From the MS-DOS command line run the following:

              $ DOSIMAGE RESTORE DTRWDSK1.IMG A:

              This writes the first image file onto the first floppy
              disk (Disk 1).

           5. Repeat this procedure by writing DTRWDSK2.IMG and
              DTRWDSK3.IMG onto Disk 2 and Disk 3 respectively.

           Proceed to install DATATRIEVE Client for Windows using the
           steps outlined in Section 1.2 of the DATATRIEVE Client for
           Windows User's Guide.

     3.10 Deleting Unused Files for DATATRIEVE DECwindows Motif
          Support

           If the DATATRIEVE DECwindows Motif interface is not
           required at your site, you can delete the following
           files after the DATATRIEVE installation has successfully
           completed:

           o  SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]DTRHELP.EXE

           o  SYS$COMMON:[DECW$BOOK]DTR_DECW_HELP_MOTIF.DECW$BOOK

           o  SYS$COMMON:[DECW$BOOK]DTR_DECW_HELP_MOTIF.DECW$BOOKSHELF

           o  SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]VAX_DATATRIEVE.UID

           o  SYS$COMMON:[DTR]REMOTE_DECTERM.COM

           If you delete any of the DATATRIEVE DECwindows Motif
           files, ensure that you delete all of the listed files.

              your SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM files.

        3.11 Getting Help and Reporting Problems

              If you encounter a problem while using DATATRIEVE, report
              it to Compaq. Depending on the type of support you have
              and the nature of the problem, take one of the following
              actions:

              o  If you have a Software Product Services Support
                 Agreement, contact your Compaq Customer Support Center
                 (CSC), either by telephone or using the electronic
                 means provided with your support agreement (such
                 as DSNlink). The CSC provides telephone support for
                 high-level advisory and remedial assistance. When
                 you initially contact the CSC, please indicate the
                 following:

                 -  The name (e.g. OpenVMS Alpha) and the version number
                    of the operating system you are using.

                 -  The product name (DATATRIEVE) and the version number
                    of DATATRIEVE you are using.

                 -  The hardware system you are using, such as a model
                    number.

                 -  A very brief description of the problem (one
                    sentence if possible).

                 -  How critical the problem is.

                 When you submit information electronically or are
                 speaking on the phone to the appropriate DATATRIEVE
                 support specialist, you can provide more detailed
                 information. This includes the specific commands used
                 to compile and link the program, the error messages
                 displayed, and relevant detailed information (possibly
                 including source program listings). Please attempt to
                 narrow the cause of the problem to a specific module or
                 lines of code.

     3.11 Getting Help and Reporting Problems

              CSC personnel may ask for additional information,
              such as listings of any command files, INCLUDE
              files, relevant data files, and so forth. If the
              program is longer than 50 lines, submit a copy of
              it electronically or provide machine-readable media
              (floppy diskette or magnetic tape).

           o  If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement, you
              can submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

           o  If you do not have any type of software services
              support agreement and you purchased DATATRIEVE within
              one year, you can submit an SPR if you think the
              problem is caused by a software error.

           When you submit an SPR, please take the following steps:

           1. Describe as accurately as possible the circumstances
              and state of the system when the problem occurred. In
              the description, please provide:

              -  The version number of DATATRIEVE being used.

              -  The name and version number of the operating system
                 being used.

              -  A concise description of the problem with specific
                 examples. Include any error messages displayed, the
                 commands used to compile and link the program, and
                 so on.

           2. Reduce the problem to as small a size as possible.

           3. Provide a listing of the program.

           4. When you submit an SPR, remember to include listings of
              any command files, INCLUDE files, relevant data files,
              and so forth.

           5. When you submit an SPR, if the program is longer than
              50 lines, submit a copy of it on machine-readable media
              (floppy diskette or magnetic tape). If necessary, also
              submit a copy of the program library used to build the
              application.

           6. Report only one problem per SPR. This will facilitate a
              faster response.

           7. Mail the SPR package to Compaq.

     User Environment Test Packages
     4.1 Invoking DATATRIEVE

     4.1 Invoking DATATRIEVE

           To run the UETPs, you must first invoke DATATRIEVE in one
           of the following ways:

           o  Use the DCL command DATATRIEVE, as follows:

              $ DATATRIEVE

              The DCL command DATATRIEVE is useful if you are working
              in a DECwindows Motif environment. You should not
              run the UETPs using the DATATRIEVE DECwindows Motif
              interface, as you may get unexpected results. By
              using the DATATRIEVE command to invoke DATATRIEVE, you
              can specify the /INTERFACE=CHARACTER_CELL qualifier
              to invoke DATATRIEVE without the DECwindows Motif
              interface.

              If you have installed more than one DATATRIEVE image,
              you can specify the /VARIANT=image-suffix qualifier to
              run the image of DATATRIEVE you want to test.

              To invoke DATATRIEVE using these qualifiers, enter the
              following command:

              $ DATATRIEVE/INTERFACE=CHARACTER_CELL/VARIANT=xx

              The characters xx represent the 1- to 26-character
              suffix added at installation to identify a particular
              image of DATATRIEVE Version 7.2A.

           o  Use the DCL command RUN as follows:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:DTR32xx.EXE

              The xx represents the 1- to 26-character optional
              suffix added to an image of DATATRIEVE at installation.

           o  Use a symbol you have defined to represent the RUN
              command. For example:

              $ DTR32

           At the DTR> prompt, enter the command to execute the UETP
           you want to run. The UETPs and the commands to invoke them

        4.2 DATATRIEVE UETP

              To run the DATATRIEVE UETP, invoke DATATRIEVE as described
              in Section 4.1, Invoking DATATRIEVE and type the following
              command:

              DTR> @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR]DTR

              The DATATRIEVE UETP is approximately 20 pages long, so the
              entire UETP is not repeated here.

              You respond to prompts during the DATATRIEVE UETP. The
              parts of the UETP that require a response are included
              here along with suggested responses. The responses you
              enter are printed in bolded ink.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The DATATRIEVE UETP suggests at one point that
                you use LP: to print a report directly to a line
                printer. The LP: option may not work unless LP is
                defined as the system printer.

     4.6 DATATRIEVE and Forms UETP

           You need a VT52-, VT100-, VT200-, or VT300-family terminal
           or a workstation to run the DATATRIEVE and forms UETP.

           If DATATRIEVE was installed with support for VAX TDMS or
           Compaq FMS, you can run the forms UETP to test the forms
           interface.

           To run the forms UETP, set your OpenVMS default to a
           directory that contains YACHT.DAT and OWNER.DAT. Be
           sure that you have WRITE access (W) to these files.
           You can copy YACHT.DAT and OWNER.DAT from the directory
           DTR$LIBRARY if you do not have them in your directory.
           Then invoke DATATRIEVE as described in Section 4.1,
           Invoking DATATRIEVE and type the following command:

           DTR> @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR]FORMS

           When DATATRIEVE uses a form to print records, the screen
           clears before the first record is printed. The DATATRIEVE
           and forms UETP asks you to enter a character and press
           RETURN before each statement, causing the forms product to
           erase the screen.

           The following is a summary of the DATATRIEVE and forms
           UETP:

           1. The UETP sends instructions to your screen and waits
              for you to enter a character and press RETURN. After
              you respond, the UETP defines three domains that use
              the forms product: YACHTS, SAILBOATS, and FAMILIES.
              The definitions use forms libraries that are located in
              DTR$LIBRARY.

              2. The UETP readies YACHTS and prints a few records
                 without using the forms product. Then the UETP sends
                 more instructions to your screen and waits for you to
                 enter a character and press RETURN. After you respond,
                 the UETP prints a record using the forms product. Press
                 RETURN after the forms product displays the record.

              3. The UETP sends instructions to your screen and waits
                 for you to enter a character and press RETURN. After
                 you respond, the UETP prints several records using the
                 forms product. Press RETURN after the forms product
                 displays each record.

              4. The UETP tests the STORE statement. The UETP sends
                 instructions to your screen and waits for you to enter
                 a character and press RETURN. After you respond, the
                 forms product puts a form on the screen for you to
                 fill in. To move the cursor from one field to another,
                 use the TAB and BACK SPACE keys. The TAB key moves
                 the cursor to the next field; the BACK SPACE key moves
                 the cursor back to the previous field. Help is also
                 available for some fields if you have trouble entering
                 an acceptable value. Position the cursor on that field
                 and press the HELP key. After you fill in the form,
                 press RETURN.

              5. The UETP tests the MODIFY statement controlling the
                 DISPLAY_FORM statement. The UETP sends instructions
                 to your screen and waits for you to enter a character
                 and press RETURN. After you respond, the forms product
                 displays the first record for you to modify. Use the
                 TAB and BACK SPACE keys to move from one field to
                 another. Modify only the BEAM field in each record.
                 Any other modifications are not written to the data
                 file. After you modify each record, press RETURN.

              6. The UETP tests the PRINT statement again, using
                 the SAILBOATS view domain. The UETP waits for you
                 to enter a character and press RETURN before each
                 PRINT statement. After the forms product displays the
                 SAILBOAT records, the UETP sends the following message
                 to your screen:

                                             DATATRIEVE CBT Installation



              This chapter describes the installation procedure for the
              DATATRIEVE computer-based training (CBT).


              1. Before Starting

                    Before starting the DATATRIEVE CBT installation,
                    please completely review this chapter. Be sure to
                    gather information to answer the prompts before
                    starting the installation.

                    If you already have a previous version of the
                    DATATRIEVE CBT installed, the CBT can remain. This
                    new kit will add to or overwrite the existing CBTs
                    as appropriate.

              2. Pre-installation of the DATATRIEVE CBT

                    Perform the following steps before running the
                    VMSINSTAL procedure:

                    -  Copy the new kit from the tape containing the
                       savesets, DTC010.A and DTC010.B.

                    -  Set your process privileges to ALL.

                                  SET PROC/PRIV=ALL

                    -  Check to see if the DATATRIEVE CBT was previously
                       installed:

                                  SHOW LOGICAL EASY$MANAGER

                       If the logical exists, the DATATRIEVE CBT has
                       been installed before. Invoke shutdown command
                       for each node in the cluster:

                                  @SYS$MANAGER:EASY$SHUTDOWN.COM

                                         DATATRIEVE CBT Installation 5-1

 



     DATATRIEVE CBT Installation


                    Next, invoke the startup command for the node on
                    which you are installing:

                               @SYS$MANAGER:EASY$STARTUP.COM

                    If you find that the DATATRIEVE CBT has been
                    previously installed, go on to Step 3, SITE WITH
                    A PREVIOUS EASYAUTHOR INSTALLATION, and do the
                    actual installation.

                 -  Find a UIC (if EasyAuthor CBTs not previously
                    installed on system).

                    Find an available UIC to become the owner of
                    the files to be installed. A new account name
                    (EASYMGR) is created during install. This account
                    has the DISUSER flag set.

                 -  Find a disk to use (if this is the first time you
                    install on the system).

                    The installation will require approximately
                    12,000 blocks.

           3. Installation of the DATATRIEVE CBT

                 Perform the install by running VMSINSTAL. The
                 following is a log file of the installation.
                 Notations (<<-) are included to show where entry
                 is required. These notations will not appear on the
                 screen during the install.

              4. Post-install of the DATATRIEVE CBT

                    Run the following command file:

                                 @EASY$PROGRAM:SETUP.COM

                    Before any of the system's users can access this
                    CBT, the EASY and LOADDRAW symbols must be added
                    to SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM or user's LOGIN.COM as
                    follows:

                                 EASY :== $EASY$PROGRAM:SOLORTP.EXE
                                 LOADDRAW :== $EASY$PROGRAM:LOADDRAW.EXE

                    Upon completion of the above steps, the DATATRIEVE
                    CBT is installed on a single node. To test the
                    installation, run it from a user account by typing:

                                 EASY

                    Edit the main course menu file to remove duplicate
                    lines (if the course was previously installed). The
                    file is EASY$PROGRAM:EASY.CAT.

              5. Start-up in clustered systems

                    To enable the lessons on all nodes in the cluster,
                    run the EASY$STARTUP command on EACH NODE as
                    follows:

                                 @SYS$MANAGER:EASY$STARTUP.COM

              6. De-installation of the DATATRIEVE CBT (if ever
                 necessary)

                    A shutdown command file can be found in SYS$MANAGER.
                    The name of the file is EASY$SHUTDOWN.COM. This
                    command file removes all logicals, logical name
                    tables, and shared images associated with this
                    package.

                 To completely remove this package from the system:

                 o  Examine the EASY$LESSONS logical. This logical
                    will tell you where the CBT has been installed.

                 o  Execute the command file (for all nodes if
                    clustered),

                              @SYS$MANAGER:EASY$SHUTDOWN

                 o  Remove the entire [EASYMGR] directory tree.

                 o  Remove EASYMGR from the user authorization file.

                              RUN AUTHORIZE
                              REMOVE EASYMGR
                              EXIT

                 o  Delete the command files,

     Sample Installation Session (VAX Only)


         The DATATRIEVE product is built using several object
         libraries which can also be used to customize DATATRIEVE
         to suit your needs (see the DATATRIEVE documentation manual,
         'Guide to Programming and Customizing').   These object libraries
         are now built using the DEC C compiler.    If you have been
         programming your own customizations and wish to continue using the
         VAX C compiler, you have the option of installing the object
         libraries which have been built using that compiler instead.

         If you answer YES to this question, DATATRIEVE will be
         linked with the VAX C RTL, and the libraries in DTR$LIBRARY will
         contain objects built with the VAX C compiler.

         If you answer NO to this question, DATATRIEVE will be
         linked with the DEC C RTL, and the libraries in DTR$LIBRARY will
         contain objects built with DEC C compiler.

         Unless you customize your use of DATATRIEVE and want to
         continue using the VAX C compiler for your own customizations,
         answer NO to this question:

     * Do you want to install DATATRIEVE using object libraries built with the VAX C compiler [NO]?

             Product:      DTR or DTR-USER
             Producer:     DIGITAL
             Version:      V7.2A
             Release Date: 22-OCT-1997

     * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded? yes
     * Do you want to use default answers for all questions [YES]? no

         VAXLSE is installed on your system.

         You now have the following options:

             1.   Do a complete DATATRIEVE installation including
                  DATATRIEVE support for LSE.

             2.   Do only DATATRIEVE support for LSE without
                  installing DATATRIEVE.

             3.   Do a DATATRIEVE installation without including
                  DATATRIEVE support for LSE.
     * Select option [1]: 1

                The following Forms Management products have been found on
                this system:
                TDMS (Terminal Data Management System)
                FMS  (Forms Management System)

                DATATRIEVE can be built to support any one of these
                products, or, if desired, DATATRIEVE can be built without
                support of any of these Forms Management products

        * Do you want DATATRIEVE to support one of these products  [YES]? yes
        * Do you wish to have TDMS Forms Management support [YES]? no
        * Do you wish to have FMS Forms Management support [YES]? yes

            It is possible to do more than one installation of DATATRIEVE.
            More than one installation of a single version may be desirable
            for a number of reasons including:

                o Use of multiple forms management products (such as
                  FMS and TDMS; DECforms is available in every image,
                  if present on the system)

                o Use of multiple foreign language translations of
                  DATATRIEVE (such as French or German)

        * Do you plan to install this version more than once [NO]? no
        * Do you want DTRSHR.EXE and DTRMSGS.EXE to be installed SHARED [YES]?
        * Do you want DTRAPI.EXE to be installed SHARED [YES]?
        * Do you want DTR32.EXE to be installed SHARED [YES]?
        * Do you want DDMF.EXE to be installed SHARED [YES]?
        * Do you wish to have the plot definitions [YES]?

            Some optional material is available with this kit including
            the components of DATATRIEVE that can be tailored at
            the installed site.
        * Do you want the optional material [NO]? yes
        * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

            The DATATRIEVE IVP will be put in the SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR]
            directory. You may run the IVP immediatly after the completion of
            the installation procedure answering YES to the next question or
            later issuing the following command:

            @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR]DTR$IVP.COM DTR32.EXE

     Sample Installation Session (VAX Only)


     * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?
     * Proceed with this installation [YES]?


         All questions regarding the installation have now been asked.

         The installation of DATATRIEVE will now continue for
         20 minutes to 40 minutes.

         DATATRIEVE User Environment Test Packages (UETPs)
         have been provided and can be run after the installation is
         complete. They are invoked from DATATRIEVE as follows:

         DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]dtr     ! The general test"
         DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]plots   ! The plots test
         DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]dbms    ! The DEC DBMS test

         DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]forms   ! The Forms test

         Before invoking these files from a user's account you must
         execute the procedure :
                         @DTR$LIBRARY:NEWUSER.COM
         This procedure loads the DATATRIEVE definitions into the
         user's dictionary and the data files in the user's directory.
         This procedure must be executed by each user needing
         the DATATRIEVE examples
