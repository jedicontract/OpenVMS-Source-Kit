                                                                 Preface



              The Digital SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator (TE) is a software
              product that lets OpenVMS operating system users
              interactively communicate with programs running on an
              IBM host computer using one of Digital's interconnect
              systems.

              This document tells you how to install the Digital SNA
              3270 Terminal Emulator software on the OpenVMS operating
              system. It is intended primarily for system managers
              or anyone else who is responsible for installing and
              maintaining application software.

              Keep this document with your distribution kit. You will
              need it to install maintenance updates or to reinstall the
              software.

              For more information on installing the Digital SNA
              3270 TE software on OpenVMS systems, refer to the
              installation/operations guide for your particular
              processor.

              This guide describes the installation procedure step by
              step. The system prompts you to answer questions and to
              perform tasks, such as changing volumes, and waits for you
              to tell it to continue.

              Default values appear in brackets ([]) throughout the
              installation procedure. This means that if you simply
              press return in response to any of the installation
              questions where an answer or value appears in brackets,
              the system uses that answer or value.



                                                                       v

                                              Preparing for Installation



              Before you install the Digital SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator
              (TE) for OpenVMS software, you must prepare your system,
              its communications components, and the remote system to
              ensure proper operation of the software.

              This chapter describes the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing the Digital SNA 3270 TE.

              Your bill of materials (BOM) specifies the number and
              contents of your media. Be sure to check the contents of
              your kit against this information. If your kit is damaged
              or if you find that parts of it are missing, contact your
              Digital representative before continuing the installation.

        1.1 Required Operating System Components

              The Digital SNA 3270 TE requires the following OpenVMS
              versions:

              o  OpenVMS Alpha Versions 6.1, 6.2, or 7.0

              o  OpenVMS VAX Versions 6.1, 6.2, or 7.0

        1.2 Prerequisite Software Requirements

              Version 1.6 of the TE requires OpenVMS VAX, Versions
              6.1, 6.2, or 7.0, or OpenVMS Alpha, Versions 6.1, 6.2,
              or 7.0, and the corresponding version of DECnet or TCP/IP.
              The Terminal Emulator software also requires one of the
              following system configurations for proper operation:
              Either the Digital SNA Gateway-ST, Digital SNA Gateway-CT,
              Digital SNA Domain Gateway-CT, Digital SNA Domain Gateway-
              ST, Digital SNA Peer Server, or OpenVMS/SNA (OpenVMS VAX
              Version 6.1 only) systems must be part of your DECnet or
              TCP/IP network . For more information on these products,
              see the following documentation:

     1.2.1 Accessing the On-line Release Notes

           The Digital SNA 3270 TE provides on-line release notes.
           You should read the release notes before you install
           the product. The release notes contain the latest
           enhancements to the product, which may include changes
           to the installation procedure. The installation procedure
           asks you if you want to display or print the release notes
           during step five of the installation procedure, if you
           executed the VMSINSTAL command procedure with the OPTIONS
           N parameter.

           After you have installed the product, you can read the
           release notes by either typing or printing the file
           SYS$HELP:SNATE016.RELEASE_NOTES. Do not delete the release
           notes for previous versions of the Terminal Emulator.

     1.3 OpenVMS License Management Facility

           The license registration information you need is contained
           in the Product Authorization Key (PAK) that is shipped
           with the Digital SNA 3270 TE for OpenVMS software. The PAK
           is a paper certificate that contains information about the
           license you have to run a particular piece of software.

     1-2 Preparing for Installation

 






              It is best to register your Digital SNA 3270 TE license
              before you perform the installation. During the instal-
              lation, VMSINSTAL asks you if you have registered the
              Digital SNA 3270 TE license and loaded the appropriate
              authorization key. If you have not already done so, you
              can complete the installation procedure, although you will
              not be able to run the TE software. Once you perform the
              license registration and have loaded an authorization key,
              you will be able to run the TE software.

              To register a license, first log in to the system
              manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice of two
              ways to perform the registration:

              o  Execute the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM command
                 procedure. When it prompts you for information,
                 respond with the information that is on your Product
                 Authorization Key (PAK) form.

              o  Issue the LICENSE REGISTER DCL command with the
                 appropriate qualifiers that correspond to information
                 on the PAK.

              For complete information on using LMF, see the manual
              on the OpenVMS License Management Utility in the OpenVMS
              documentation set.

        1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The following sections detail the various requirements for
              installing the Digital SNA 3270 TE for OpenVMS software.

              The installation should take approximately 5 to 15
              minutes, depending on the type of media and your system
              configuration. Before installing the Terminal Emulator
              software, you must have the following privileges:

              o  SETPRV privilege, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
                 privileges. Note that VMSINSTAL disables BYPASS
                 privilege at the start of the installation.

              Table 1-1 shows the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha
              resources required for installation.

              TE, you must raise those values by the number indicated.
              (See Section 1.4.1.2.)
              __________________________________________________________

              The following sections show you how to check system
              parameter values, with the OpenVMS System Generation
              Utility (SYSGEN), and calculate values for the GBLPAGES
              and GBLSECTIONS system parameters, and change parameter
              values with the OpenVMS AUTOGEN command procedure.

        1.4.1.1 Checking System Parameter Values

              To check the values of your system parameters, enter the
              following command at the DCL prompt to invoke the SYSGEN
              utility:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN>

              At the SYSGEN> prompt, enter the SHOW command to display
              the value of each system parameter. The values displayed
              should equal or exceed the value of each parameter listed
              in Table 1-2. The following command displays the value for
              the WSMAX system parameter:

              SYSGEN> SHOW WSMAX

              After you finish checking the parameters with the SHOW
              command, you can enter the EXIT command at the SYSGEN>
              prompt to return to DCL level.

              Dynamic parameters changed with the SYSGEN utility become
              active immediately without any need to reboot your system.
              In fact, rebooting returns dynamic system parameter values
              to their previous settings, so you should complete the
              installation before rebooting the system.

     1.4.1.2 Calculating the Values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS

           To install and run the Digital SNA 3270 TE, you must set
           the correct values for the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS system
           parameters.

           The n + nnn values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS in
           Table 1-2 indicates the required number of unused global
           pages or global sections available on your system for the
           installation to process successfully. To calculate how
           many unused global pages and global sections your system
           has, perform the following steps:

           1. Run the OpenVMS Install Utility (INSTALL) using the
              following DCL commands:

              $ INSTALL LIST /GLOBAL /SUMMARY

              The INSTALL utility displays a summary of global pages
              and global sections used by your system, as well as the
              current number of unused global pages. For example:

                               Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

              258 Global Sections Used,  22580/3420 Global Pages Used/Unused

           2. Determine if the number of unused pages (3420 in
              the example) is equal to or greater than the number
              specified in Table 1-2. If the number of unused pages
              is less than the number listed in the table, you need
              to increase the value for GBLPAGES.

           3. Note the amount shown for "Global Sections Used" (258
              in the example).

           4. Run the SYSGEN utility and use the SHOW command to
              determine the number of global sections that have been
              allocated:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS

              Parameter Name  Current  Defaul  Minimum   Maximum Unit  Dynamic
              --------------  ------- -------  -------   ------- ----  -------
              GBLSECTIONS        512     250       20      4095 Sections

     1-6 Preparing for Installation

 






              5. Subtract the amount shown in the summary (258 in the
                 example) from the amount allocated. If the difference
                 is less than the number required in Table 1-2, you need
                 to increase the value of the GBLSECTIONS parameter.

              Section 1.4.1.3 describes the procedures for increasing
              these values as well as those of other system parameters.
              Refer to the OpenVMS documentation on system management
              and operations for more information.

        1.4.1.3 Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN

              You use the AUTOGEN command procedure to change system
              parameters. AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for
              parameters that are associated with the ones you reset
              manually. To change system parameters with AUTOGEN, you
              must edit the following file:

              SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

              For example, to change the setting for the WSMAX system
              parameter, add this line to the file:

              WSMAX = 1024

              Or for incremental SYSGEN parameters:

              ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000

              Now, run the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
              parameters. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

              AUTOGEN performs an automatic system shutdown and reboots
              when it has finished. Rebooting your system makes the
              new parameter values active. Also on OpenVMS Version 6.1
              systems you may wish to add the [NO]FEEDBACK parameter
              to the AUTOGEN command line. For more information
              about using AUTOGEN, see the instructions on modifying
              system parameters in the OpenVMS documentation on System
              Management and Operations.

     1.4.2 VMSINSTAL Requirements

           When you run the VMSINSTAL command procedure, it checks
           the following criteria:

           o  Whether you have set your default device and directory
              to SYS$UPDATE

           o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account

           o  Whether you have adequate quotas for the installation

           o  Whether any users are logged in to the system

           If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
           it notifies you of the problem and asks if you want to
           continue the installation. In some instances, you can
           enter YES to continue. To stop the installation process
           and correct the situation, enter NO or press RETURN. Then
           correct the problem and restart the installation.

     1.4.3 Backing Up Your System Disk

           At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if
           you have backed up your system disk. Digital recommends
           that you do a system disk backup before installing any
           software on top of the operating system.

           Use the backup procedures that have been established at
           your site. For details on performing a system disk backup,
           see the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS
           documentation set.

     1.4.4 License Management Utility Requirements

           You will need to register and load your license for the
           Digital SNA 3270 TE before you start the installation in
           order to run the Installation Verification Procedure.

           Refer to the OpenVMS documentation on the License
           Management Utility for information about registering your
           license.

                                                            Installation



              This chapter describes how to install the Digital SNA 3270
              Terminal Emulator (TE) for OpenVMS. It contains a step-by-
              step description of the installation procedure and tasks
              you must perform after the installation. The final section
              contains an actual system log of an installation using PAK
              information and VMSINSTAL.

              Note that throughout the installation default values
              appear in brackets. To abort the installation procedure
              at any time, press <Ctrl/Y>. Doing this causes the
              installation procedure to delete all files it has created
              up to that point, and returns to DCL. If you want to retry
              the installation after aborting it, you must proceed from
              step two.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                You can install the TE software from two locations:
                the Consolidated Software Distribution CD-ROM or
                a remote node in your local area network using the
                Remote Installation Service (RIS). The VMSINSTAL
                procedure presented in this chapter assumes the TE
                software is being installed from your local area
                network.

                To install the TE software from the Consolidated
                Software Distribution CD-ROM, see the master
                index table in the document Consolidated Software
                Distribution Disk User's Guide for the directory
                containing the TE files.

     2.1 General Information

           This section includes information about accessing release
           notes, determining what files are added to your system,
           running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP), and
           aborting the installation.

           On-line help also directs you to the release notes file.
           After the installation, you can enter the following
           command to review them through the help facility:

           $ HELP SNA_TERMINALS RELEASE_NOTES

     2.1.1 Determining the Files Added to the System

           The TE installation procedure adds a number of new files
           to your system. Appendix B contains a complete listing of
           all files the installation procedure adds.

     2.1.2 Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

           The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for the
           Digital SNA 3270 TE verifies that the installation
           was performed correctly. During the installation, you
           are asked if you want to run the IVP as part of the
           installation procedure. If you respond YES, VMSINSTAL
           runs the IVP. It is recommended that you run the IVP to be
           sure that the Digital SNA 3270 TE is installed correctly.

           After the Digital SNA 3270 TE is installed, you can run
           the IVP independently to verify that the software is
           available on your system. You might also want to run the
           IVP after a system failure to be sure that users can use
           the Digital SNA 3270 TE software. See Section 3.2 for
           information on how to run the IVP.

     2.2 The Installation Procedure

           The Digital SNA 3270 TE installation process consists
           of a series of questions and informational messages.
           The installation procedure takes between ten and fifteen
           minutes to complete.

           Digital recommends that you use a hardcopy terminal to
           install the Terminal Emulator if you want a copy of the
           installation process. If you do not have a hard-copy

     2-2 Installation

 






              terminal, you can produce a copy of the installation
              procedure by using the following command:

              $  SET HOST 0/LOG=file-name

              where file-name is the name of the file in which you wish
              to store the installation procedure log information.
              After the installation completes, you can log off from
              the current session, and print the file that contains the
              log of the installation procedure. If you do not specify a
              file name, the system automatically creates a file called
              SETHOST.LOG.

        2.2.1 Steps to Install the Digital SNA 3270 TE

              To start the installation, execute the VMSINSTAL command
              procedure from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM
              account. Use the following command to start VMSINSTAL:

              @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL product-name device-name OPTIONS N

























                                                        Installation 2-3

 






           where

           product-name
           is the installation name for the component. For the
           Digital SNA 3270 TE, use the following installation name:

           SNATE016

           device-name
           is the name of the device on which you plan to mount the
           media. For example, MTA0: is the device name for a tape
           drive. It is not necessary to use the console tape drive
           for this installation. However, if you do use the console
           tape drive, you should replace any media you removed once
           the installation is completed.

           OPTIONS N
           is an optional parameter that indicates you want to be
           prompted to display or print the release notes. If you do
           not include the OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not
           prompt you to display or print the release notes. You are
           advised to read the release notes before proceeding with
           the installation.

           VMSINSTAL has several other options. For further
           information, see the OpenVMS documentation on software
           installation.

           The following example displays the command to invoke
           VMSINSTAL to install the Digital SNA 3270 TE from tape
           drive MTA0: and the system response. This example uses
           the OPTIONS N parameter for printing or displaying release
           notes.

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SNATE016 MTA0: OPTIONS N

                 OpenVMS VAX Software Product Installation Procedure V6.1

           It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
           Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

           If you do not supply either the product name or the device
           name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information later on
           in the installation procedure. VMSINSTAL also prompts you
           for any options you want to use with the installation.

        2.2.2 Installation Questions

              This section describes the questions that appear during
              the installation. See Appendix A for a sample installation
              procedure.

              Each question in the installation is marked with an
              asterisk (*) at the beginning of the line. Some questions
              show the default response in brackets, for example [YES].
              If you want to give the default response for a particular
              question, simply press <Return>.

              1. System backup

                 VMSINSTAL asks you if you have made a backup copy of
                 your system disk. You should always back up your system
                 disk before performing an installation.

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                 If you are satisfied with the backup of your system
                 disk, press <Return>. Otherwise, enter NO to discon-
                 tinue the installation. After you back up your system
                 disk, you can restart the installation.

              2. Mounting the media

                 You should now mount the first distribution volume on
                 the device you specified when you invoked VMSINSTAL.
                 The device name appears in the line preceding the
                 question. VMSINSTAL then asks you if you are ready
                 to continue with the installation.

                 If you respond YES to indicate that you are ready,
                 VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing
                 the Digital SNA 3270 TE has been mounted on the
                 specified device and that the installation has begun.
                 For example:

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on MUA0:.
                 * Are you ready? YES
                 %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, SNATE016 MOUNTED ON _MUA0:  (NODE 1)
                 The following products will be processed:
                   SNATE V1.6

                     Beginning installation of SNATE V1.6 at hh:mm

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

                                                        Installation 2-5

 






              If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
              VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, enter
              NO in response to the "Are you ready?" question. To
              abort the installation for any other reason, press
              <Ctrl/Y>.

           3. Release Notes

              If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL,
              you are now given five options for reviewing the
              release notes:

              Release Notes Options:

                  1. Display release notes
                  2. Print release notes
                  3. Both 1 and 2
                  4. Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
                  5. Do not display, print or copy release notes

              * Select option [2]:

              If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes immediately on the console terminal. You can
              terminate the display at any time by pressing <Ctrl/C>.

              If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for the
              name of the print queue to which you want to send the
              file:

              * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

              Either type in a queue name or press <Return> to send
              the file to the default output print device.

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes immediately on the console terminal and then
              prompts you for a queue name for the printed version.

              If you choose option 4, VMSINSTAL copies the release
              notes to the file SYS$HELP:SNATE016.RELEASE_NOTES.

              If you select option 5, VMSINSTAL does not display,
              print, or copy the release notes.

           4. Continuing the installation

     2-6 Installation

 






                 Regardless of the option you choose, the installation
                 procedure now asks if you want to continue the
                 installation. To continue the installation, enter YES.
                 Otherwise, press <Return> to terminate the installation
                 procedure.

                 * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES

                 The release notes are located in the following file:

                 SYS$HELP:SNATE016.RELEASE_NOTES.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The name of the release notes file VMSINSTAL copies
                consists of the current product name and version
                number. Do not delete release notes for previous
                versions of the TE software.

                _____________________________________________________

              5. License Registration

                 The installation procedure asks if you have registered
                 and loaded your product authorization key for the TE
                 and displays information specific to the product, for
                 example:

                 Product:          SNA-3270-TE
                 Producer:         DEC
                 Version:          1.6
                 Release Date:     dd-mmm-yyyy

                 The installation inquires:

                 *Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

                 If you have not registered and loaded your authoriza-
                 tion key, you must answer "NO" to this question. You
                 can still complete the installation procedure at this
                 time, although you will not be able to run the TE
                 software. See Section 1.3 for more information.

              6. Choosing to run the Installation Verification Procedure
                 (IVP)

                                                        Installation 2-7

 






              The installation procedure now asks if you want to
              run the Installation Verification Procedure. The IVP
              for the Digital SNA 3270 TE checks to be sure that the
              installation is successful. It is recommended that you
              run the IVP.

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

           7. Choosing to purge files

              You have the option to purge files from previous
              versions of the Digital SNA 3270 TE that this
              installation supersedes. Purging is recommended,
              although if you need to keep files from previous
              versions, enter NO in response to this question.

              *Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation[YES]?

     2.2.3 Informational Messages

           At this point, the installation procedure displays a
           number of informational messages that report on the
           progress of the installation. There are no further
           questions, except for any that apply to the IVP. If the
           installation procedure has been successful up to this
           point, VMSINSTAL moves the new or modified files to their
           target directories, updates help files, and updates DCL
           tables, if necessary. If you asked for files to be purged,
           that work is done now. The following message is displayed:

           To make the terminal emulator shareable each time the system
           reboots, you must add the following line to your system startup
           procedure:

            @SYS$STARTUP:SNATE$STARTUP

           This command installs the TE software as a shareable
           image. If you are installing the TE software on a
           VAXcluster, you must execute this command file on each
           node in the cluster. See the chapter on post-installation
           consideration for more information. The installation
           procedure also displays the following message:

           %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target
           directories...

        2.2.4 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              If you chose to run the IVP, VMSINSTAL runs it now. When
              the IVP runs successfully, you see the following display:

              Starting Digital SNA 3270 TE V1.6 IVP
              Digital SNA 3270 TE V1.6 IVP completed successfully

        2.2.5 Completing the Installation Procedure

              The following messages indicate that the entire installa-
              tion procedure is complete:

                 Installation of SNATE V1.6 completed at hh:mm

              Enter the products to be processed from the next distribution
                  volume set.
              * Products: EXIT

                 VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

              The installation procedure also asks you if there are
              any more products you want to install. If there are more
              products to install, enter the name of the next software
              product. If there are no more products to install, type
              EXIT and press <Return>.

              The installation of the Terminal Emulator is now complete,
              and you can log out of the privileged account:

              $ LOGOUT
              SYSTEM     logged out at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ss

              Note that VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the
              process symbol table during the installation. Therefore,
              if you are going to continue using the system manager's
              account and you want to restore these symbols, you should
              log out and then log back in again.

        2.3 Error Recovery

              If errors occur during the installation itself or when
              the IVP is running, VMSINSTAL displays failure messages.
              If the installation fails, the following message is
              displayed:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of SNATE V1.6 has failed.

                                                        Installation 2-9

 






           If the IVP fails, the following messages are displayed:

           Digital SNA 3270 TE V1.6 IVP failed.

           Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
           following conditions exist:

           o  The operating system version is incorrect.

           o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

           o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
              insufficient.

           o  System parameter values for successful installation are
              insufficient.

           o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

           o  The product is not properly licensed.

           For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
           conditions, see the OpenVMS documentation on system
           messages, recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software
           installation. If you are notified that any of these
           conditions exist, you should take the appropriate action
           as described in the message. (You might need to change a
           system parameter or increase an authorized quota value.)
           For information on installation requirements, see Chapter
           1.

                                                  After the Installation



              After installing the Digital SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator
              (TE) for OpenVMS, you may need to perform some or all of
              the following tasks:

              o  Edit the system startup file

              o  Run the IVP

              o  Reboot the system

              o  Set user account quotas

              o  Install the TE on a VMScluster

        3.1 Editing System Files

              You must edit the system startup file to provide for
              automatic startup of the Digital SNA 3270 TE when your
              system is rebooted.

              Add the command line that starts the Digital SNA 3270 TE
              to the system startup file, SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.

              @SYS$STARTUP:SNATE$STARTUP

              You must position this new command line after the line
              that invokes the network startup command procedure for
              DECnet Phase IV. The following example shows the network
              startup command line followed by the startup command line
              for the Digital SNA 3270 TE:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:STARTNET.COM
                   .
                   .
                   .
              $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNATE$STARTUP

                                              After the Installation 3-1

 






     3.2 Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

           The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for the
           Digital SNA 3270 TE verifies the installation. During the
           installation, you are asked if you want to run the IVP as
           part of the installation. If you respond YES, VMSINSTAL
           runs the IVP. It is recommended that you run the IVP to be
           sure that the TE software is installed correctly.

           After the Digital SNA 3270 TE is installed, you can run
           the IVP independently to verify that the software is
           available on your system.

           The IVP for the Digital SNA 3270 TE is a command procedure
           that is stored in the directory SYS$TEST after you install
           the software. To run the IVP interactively after the
           installation, issue the following command:

           $ @SYS$TEST:SNATE$IVP

           Executing this command procedure runs the IVP indepen-
           dently of the installation procedure.

     3.3 Rebooting the System

           You can reboot your system after you have installed the
           Digital SNA 3270 TE, edited the system startup file,
           and reset the system parameters (if necessary). A system
           reboot verifies that Digital SNA 3270 TE is ready for use,
           and ensures that the edits to the system startup command
           file are correct, and establishes any new parameter
           settings. Note, however, that rebooting is optional.

     3.4 User Account Requirements

           To use the Digital SNA 3270 TE, user accounts on your
           system must have certain privileges and quotas. The next
           two sections contain information on these requirements.

     3.4.1 Privileges

           To use the Digital SNA 3270 TE, each account must have
           at least TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges. Use the OpenVMS
           Authorize Utility to determine whether users have the
           privileges they require.

        3.5 Installing the TE on a VMScluster System

              If you want to run the TE software on multiple nodes of a
              VMScluster system, first check to see that you have the
              appropriate software license. Then, follow these steps
              after installing the software:

              Issue the following commands on each node of the cluster:

              $ LICENSE LOAD SNA-3270-TE
              $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNATE$STARTUP.COM

        3.6 Determining and Reporting Problems

              If an error occurs while the Digital SNA 3270 TE is being
              used and you believe that the error is caused by a problem
              with the Digital SNA 3270 TE software, you should take one
              of the following actions:

              o  If you have a BASIC or DECsupport Software Agreement,
                 you should call your Customer Support Center. (With
                 these services, you receive telephone support that
                 provides high-level advisory and remedial assistance.)

              If you find an error in the Digital SNA 3270 TE documenta-
              tion, you should fill out and submit the Reader's Comments
              form at the back of the document in which the error was
              found. Include the section and page number where the error
              was found.

                                                     Sample Installation



              This appendix contains a sample installation of the
              Digital SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS. This
              sample was run on a system that had no previous version of
              the TE installed.

              You should assume that in the sample installation, no
              users are logged on to the system, and that OPTIONS N is
              specified to print the release notes. The Installation
              Verification Procedure (IVP) runs at the end of the
              installation.
