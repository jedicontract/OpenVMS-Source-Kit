Preparing to Install the Software

  Perform the following tasks before you install the communications server 
  software on your system (referred to as the load host in this procedure):

  1.  Check your load host for the following:

      a. VMS V5.0 or any subsequent maintenance release up to the next major 
         product release is installed.

      b. DECnet VAX(TM) Phase IV is running.

      c. The Ethernet controller is on the same Ethernet as the communications 
         server.

  2.  Ensure that the CMKRNL and SYSPRV privileges are set.

  3.  Verify that the load host has 2600 blocks of available disk space (2200 
      after installation) and an additional 2048 blocks for each up-line dump.

  4.  Backup the system before installing the software.

  5.  Mount the software media on an appropriate device drive, unless you are 
      installing from save sets copied from another load host.

  6.  Make a note of the communications server DECnet node address and DECnet 
      node name, supplied by the network manager, and the Ethernet hardware 
      address, supplied by the hardware installer.

  Installation requires approximately 5 minutes to complete.
 
                               (NOTE)

            License Management Facility (LMF) is not required.



Using VMSINSTAL

  Perform the following to install the communications server software on the 
  load host.  To stop the installation at any time, press Ctrl/Y.

  7.  Log in to the system manager account.

  8.  Enter the @SYS$UPDATE VMSINSTAL DS9010 your-device-identifier 
      OPTIONS N command to start VMSINSTAL.  Substitute your device identifier 
      for your-device-identifier where the distribution medium is mounted.

  9.  If there are any active processes, VMSINSTAL lists them and asks if you 
      want to continue.  Enter YES to continue the installation. 

  10. Press Return if you have backed up your system disk, and enter YES if 
      you mounted the software media on the appropriate device.

Using VMSINTAL (cont.) 

  13. Press the Return key to run the Installation Verification Procedure 
      (IVP), which is recommended.  The IVP verifies that the DECSERVER 
      directory exists, all the files from the distribution kit are in the 
      directory, and the release notes are in the SYS$HELP directory.

  14. If your system is part of a VAXcluster] system, use the 
      CREATE/DIRECTORY command on each VAXcluster node after exiting 
      VMSINSTAL so that the other nodes can execute the communications server 
      software.  You can do this after you finish this installation procedure.



Using VMSINSTAL (cont.)

  15. If you receive one of the following messages, perform the procedure 
      described within the message to update the MOM$LOAD logical name.

      One possible message:

  _____________________________________________________________________________

  Your installation is now complete. After exiting from VMSINSTAL:

  1. Modify the definition of MOM$LOAD in your system start-up file, 
  SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM, to resemble the following:

  $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/NAME=NO_ALIAS/NOLOG -
	MOM$LOAD -
	SYS$SYSROOT:[MOM$SYSTEM], -
	SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]

  This command ensures that the location of the server image is defined each 
  time the system is rebooted, necessary for successful down-line loading.
  _____________________________________________________________________________

      Another possible message:

  _____________________________________________________________________________

  Your installation is now complete. After exiting from VMSINSTAL:

  1. Add the following command to your system start-up file, 
  SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM, to resemble the following:

  $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/NAME=NO_ALIAS/NOLOG -
	MOM$LOAD -
	SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]

  This command ensures that the location of the server image is defined each 
  time the system is rebooted, necessary for successful down-line loading.
  _____________________________________________________________________________

  MOM$LOAD is a logical name that your load host uses to find the image file of 
  any product that must be down-line loaded. For each product, MOM$LOAD has an 
  associated equivalent string that specifies the location of the product image 
  file.

  If you do not get either of these messages, no modifications to the system 
  start-up file are necessary.



Using VMSINSTAL (cont.)

  16. VMSINSTAL is completed. Proceed to step 17.   Note that step 18 starts 
      the DSVCONFIG.COM procedure mentioned in the example.

  This IVP command procedure described in  the example is for informational 
  purposes.   You do not need to run it again at this time.

  _____________________________________________________________________________


  2. Configure the server into your host's database.  Execute a command 
  procedure called DSVCONFIG.COM.  This command procedure is in the 
  SYS$ROOT:[DECSERVER] directory.  If you have already executed this 
  procedure from previous installations, you only need to configure 
  additional units.  All previously defined units will still be configured.

  The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for the DECserver 90TL can 
  be found in SYS$TEST and may be run at any time by executing the command 
  procedure DS90$IVP.COM.

  VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories...

Using DSVCONFIG

  17. If you are using the optional Terminal Server Manager (TSM) software, 
      do not use the DSVCONFIG procedure; instead, refer to Terminal Server 
      Manager Installation and Use to configure the load host database.

  DSVCONFIG checks for data file DSVCONFIG.DAT in SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] or 
  SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER] for VAXcluster systems.  It finds one of three 
  situations:

  o The file does not exist. The procedure creates DSVCONFIG.DAT.

  o The file exists and is formatted correctly.

  o The file exists but not in the correct format. The procedure reformats 
    the file.

  Each VAXcluster node might have an older version of DSVCONFIG.DAT. In this 
  case, DSVCONFIG copies the communications server entries from that data file 
  into the DSVCONFIG.DAT file on SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER], and renames any 
  versions in SYS$SPECIFIC so that the DSVCONFIG.DAT file in SYS$COMMON is used 
  thereafter.


				(CAUTION)
			
              Do not execute any DECnet commands that are part of 
              DSVCONFIG separate from the DSVCONFIG procedure.  
              Otherwise, DECnet databases could be changed without 
              changing DSVCONFIG.DAT, causing a synchronization problem.





Using DSVCONFIG (cont.)

  18. Set the default to MOM$LOAD and start DSVCONFIG as shown in the 
      example.  You might get merging messages if you are on a VAXcluster 
      system.

  19. Select option 2 to add a new communications server.             

  _____________________________________________________________________________

  $ SET DEFAULT MOM$LOAD: 
  $ @DSVCONFIG 

  You must assign a unique DECnet node name and DECnet node address for each 
  new DECserver unit.

  Press <RET> to start, or <CTRL/Z> to exit...

Using DSVCONFIG (cont.)

  20. Enter the following:

      -	DS90TL for the DECserver type

      -	DECnet node name and address

        DSVCONFIG determines the validity of the node name entered.  If you 
        get an error here, choose another node name.  The one you specified is 
        in use.

      -	Communications server Ethernet address

  21. DSVCONFIG determines the load host service circuit-ID and displays this 
      ID as the default.  Press the Return key to select the default service 
      circuit-ID.

      DSVCONFIG adds the entry for the new communications server to the 
      databases and sets SERVICE ENABLED on the specified service circuit, 
      which is necessary for down-line loading.  If you get an error from 
      DECnet while adding a communications server, use option 4 to remove the 
      entry, correct the problem, then try again.

  If you get an error message now, the new DECserver unit will not be 
  completely added, and you should use menu item #4 (Delete an existing 
  DECserver) to remove it from the list of known DECservers.

Down-Line Loading the Software

  During power up of the hardware, down-line loading of the software image 
  occurs automatically.  If this is the case, do not perform steps 24 through 
  28; instead, proceed to step 29.

  24. Enter the NCP CONNECT NODE node-name command to connect to the 
      communications server. Substitute your communications server DECnet node 
      name for node-name.  If a maintenance password has been defined by the 
      communications server manager, use the following command: CONNECT NODE 
      node-name SERVICE PASSWORD password.  Substitute your communications 
      server maintenance password for password. 

  25. Press the Return key to get the communications server prompt.  Enter 
      the log-in password.  ACCESS is the communications server default log-in 
      password.

  26. Enter your user name (any string of 1 to 16 characters).

  27. Use the SET PRIVILEGED command and enter the password. The default 
      password is SYSTEM.

  28. Use the INITIALIZE command to down-line load the communications 
      server image to the communications server.  The qualifier, DELAY xx, 
      causes the communications server to wait xx minutes before initializing.  
      This permits any existing users time to log off.  You must also wait xx 
      minutes before you can continue with the procedure.

Down-Line Loading the Software (cont.)

  Perform steps 29 through 34 to verify the down-line load. 

  29. Enter the NCP CONNECT NODE node-name command to connect to the 
      communications server.  Substitute your communications server DECnet 
      node name for node-name.  If a maintenance password has been defined by 
      the communications server manager, use the following command: CONNECT 
      NODE node-name SERVICE PASSWORD password.  Substitute your communications 
      server maintenance password for password.

  30. Press the Return key to get the communications server prompt.  Enter 
      the log-in password.  ACCESS is the communications server default log-in 
      password.

  31. Read the identification message to ensure the latest version (Vn.n) of 
      the communications server image was down-line loaded. 

  32. Enter your user name (any string of 1 to 16 characters).

  33. Press Ctrl/D to return to the NCP prompt. 

  34. Enter EXIT to return to the VMS system prompt. 

  If this installation is a software upgrade, either you or the network manager 
  can now reload all existing communications servers.

Completing the Installation

  Perform the following if the installation is complete:

  35. Optionally, you should install the kit on at least two load hosts.  
      Also, you should have one load host for every 10 communications servers.

  36. Inform the system or network manager that the installation is complete.

  37. Give this document and any other software manuals to the person who 
      will be managing the communications server.

                               (NOTE)

         The installation manual fits in the pocket of the Ethernet 
         communications server documentation binder.

Installing Software on Additional VMS Hosts

  To install the server distribution software onto an additional VMS load host 
  that is not a member of a VAXcluster system, follow these steps:

  1.  Invoke VMSINSTAL at the original load host, as follows.  Substitute 
      your device drive identifier for your-device-identifier.

      $ @VMSINSTAL DS9010  your-device-identifier OPTIONS G SYS$UPDATE:

      OPTIONS G stores the save sets in the SYS$UPDATE directory.

  2. Copy the save sets from the original load host to the alternate load 
     host's SYS$UPDATE directory. The save sets are DS9nnn.A and DS9nnn.B, 
     where nnn is the version number of the DECserver 90TL software.  For 
     example, nnn equals 010 for version 1.0.

  3. Run VMSINSTAL on the alternate load host.



What to Do If the Installation Fails

  Perform the following if the installation fails:

  1.  If the down-line load fails, it could be that service on the circuit is 
      disabled.  The following command shows how to check service circuit 
      BNA-0.  Substitute your load host service circuit-ID for BNA-0. 

      $ MCR NCP 
      NCP> SHOW CIR BNA-0 CHAR 


      a. If the display shows that the service is disabled, enter the following 
         command to check if there are any users or applications using the 
         circuit:

         NCP> SHOW KNOWN LINKS 

      b. If there are no known links active, enter the following commands to 
         enable service circuit BNA-0.  Enabling the circuit disconnects the 
         active links. 

         NCP> SET CIR BNA-0 STATE OFF
         NCP> SET CIR BNA-0 SERVICE ENABLED
         NCP> SET CIR BNA-0 STATE ON
         NCP> EXIT
         $

  2.  If your load host has more than one Ethernet controller, be sure that 
      the correct service circuit-ID was used during the DSVCONFIG procedure.  
      If you do not know the load host service circuit-ID, use the NCP command 
      SHOW ACTIVE CIRCUITS to display active circuit characteristics.
