        1.1 Introducing Message Router

              Message Router is part of MAILbus. MAILbus comprises
              Message Router and its Gateways, for example, the Message
              Router VMSmail Gateway. Refer to the Introduction to
              MAILbus for details of MAILbus.

              Message Router has three components:

              o  A message transfer component, called the Transfer
                 Service, that transfers messages from one node to
                 another. The management utility MRMAN is used to manage
                 this component.

              o  A directory component, called the Directory Service,
                 which keeps a record of users in the network who can
                 send and receive mail. The management utility MBMAN is
                 used to manage this component.

              o  A set of management service routines, called the
                 Management Service, which comprises the exception
                 reporting routines and the management command
                 procedures.

              These components are installed together and the instruc-
              tions for installing them are in this book.

        1.2 Installing and Configuring Message Router

              You cannot use Message Router until you have installed
              and configured it. It is important that you plan the
              installation and configuration of Message Router before
              you start the installation. Read the VAX Message Router
              Configuration Guide for information about planning your
              mail network before installing Message Router Version 3.5.

              This book deals with the installation of Message Router on
              OpenVMS Version 5.5-2, 6.2 and 7.1.

                                                        Introduction 1-1

 






           Customers who have Message Router V3.2 or later can
           upgrade to V3.5 directly. Customers who have earlier
           Versions need to install atleast V3.2 and then upgrade
           to V3.5.

           Message Router checks for the DECnet product license.
           You must use the VMS License Management Utility to
           register the DECnet product license before starting the
           installation procedure. See the VMS License Management
           Utility Manual for details of how to use the VMS License
           Management Utility.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              An attempt to run Message Router Version 3.5 on
              OpenVMS Version 5.5-2, 6.2 and 7.1 will fail if you
              have not registered the DECnet license.

              _____________________________________________________

           The Message Router X.400 Gateway (MRX) requires Message
           Router to be configured before you install it. The
           other MAILbus Gateways do not. Therefore, after you
           have installed Message Router, you can either install
           all the MAILbus Gateways, except MRX, that you want
           to use, or configure Message Router. It is slightly
           quicker to install everything you need first. However,
           you must configure Message Router before installing MRX
           or configuring any of the other Gateways that you want to
           use.

     1.2.1 The Installation Procedure

           You do not need to install Message Router on every node
           that is going to use its services. Some User Agents
           and Gateways can use the Transfer Service and Directory
           Service components of Message Router remotely.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              The Message Router VMSmail Gateway does not use the
              Directory Service.

              _____________________________________________________

     1-2 Introduction

 






              It does not matter on which node you install Message
              Router first in a VAXcluster[TM] or a network. However,
              if you are going to use the Directory Service, the first
              node you configure must be the Directory Service master
              node. See the VAX Message Router Configuration Guide for
              more information about configuration. There are special
              considerations when installing on a VAXcluster or Local
              Area VAXcluster (see Section 2.6).

              This guide explains how to install Message Router on an
              OpenVMS operating system using VMSINSTAL. VMSINSTAL is
              a command procedure used to install optional software
              products on an OpenVMS operating system. Basic knowledge
              of VMSINSTAL is required to perform the installation.

              You can check that the installation has succeeded by
              running the installation verification procedure (IVP)
              after the installation is complete. The IVP, if you
              request it, runs automatically after the installation and
              is described fully in Chapter 4. If the IVP is successful,
              the Message Router software resides on your system, but
              cannot be used until it is configured.

              The procedure to install Message Router and run the IVP
              should take about 60 minutes, depending on the system
              configuration and type of media used. The installation
              procedure is the same, regardless of the distribution
              media.

              You can use your Message Router Version 3.5 system
              alongwith Message Router Version 3.2 and 3.3 system in
              the same network.

        1.2.2 The Configuration Procedure

              The configuration procedure for Message Router is
              described in the VAX Message Router Configuration Guide.
              For details of how to install and configure other MAILbus
              products, such as the Message Router VMSmail Gateway,
              refer to the relevant installation and management guides.

     1.3 Handling Installation Errors

           It is a good idea to take a log of the installation
           procedure to keep a record of any errors. If you receive
           an unexpected error message during the installation, do
           the following:

           1. Check that you have responded to the prompts correctly.

           2. If you have made a mistake and have been re-prompted,
              enter the correct information.

           3. If re-entering the information fails, restart the
              installation.

                                     Preparing to Install Message Router



        2.1 Preparation Checklist

              Prepare for installation as follows:

              1. Check that the distribution kit is complete and correct
                 according to the bill of materials included with the
                 kit.

                 The distribution medium contains all the files
                 listed in Appendix A and may be a magnetic tape or
                 an optical disk. The type of media depends on your
                 system hardware.

              2. Check that you have a Software Product Description
                 (SPD).

              3. Check that your system has the prerequisite software
                 and hardware. See Section 2.2.

        2.2 Prerequisite Software and Hardware

              To install Message Router Version 3.5 you must have:

              o  Version 5.5-2, 6.2 and 7.1 Year 2000 ECO patches
                 installed

              o  A valid VAX or MicroVAX system configuration.

                 Note that you cannot use node names longer that six
                 characters with Message Router. Therefore, on DECnet
                 /OSI systems, the node name synonym database must
                 be accessible on the node where Message Router is
                 installed.

              o  A registered Product Authorization Key (PAK) for
                 DECnet. Section 2.2.1 describes how to make sure that
                 the DECnet PAK is registered.

                                 Preparing to Install Message Router 2-1

 






           o  A minimum of 19000 free blocks on the system disk
              available for installation and 9000 blocks available
              permanently.

           o  Disk space to hold messages, directory database files,
              and queue files. Initially, you need about 30000 free
              blocks on the target disk. This is the disk where the
              Message Router directories are to be created.

           o  OpenVMS[TM] for VAX[TM] Version 5.5-2, Version 6.2, or
              Version 7.1.

           o  OpenVMS[TM]/VAX Version 5.5-2 either DECnet VAX Version
              5.5-2 or DECnet/OSI [R] Version 5.6B.

           o  OpenVMS[TM]/VAX Version 6.2 either DECnet VAX Version
              6.2 or DECnet/OSI [R] Version 6.3.

           o  OpenVMS[TM]/VAX Version 7.1 either DECnet VAX or DECnet
              /OSI [R] Version 7.1.

     2.2.1 Checking the DECnet Product Authorization Key (PAK)

           You must ensure that a DECnet PAK is registered and active
           before starting the installation. To do this, type the
           following command:

           $ LICENSE LIST /FULL license

           where license is either DVNETRTG or DVNETEND.

           Details of the DECnet license are displayed. Check that
           the license is active. If it is not, you must load and
           register either of the PAKs for DECnet as described in the
           VMS License Management Utility Manual.

     2.2.2 Tailoring OpenVMS

           You must check that appropriate OpenVMS software is
           available on your system. Do this using the OpenVMS
           Tailoring utility. The tailoring utility enables you to
           add and remove software from the OpenVMS system. You can
           use the OpenVMS Tailoring utility on any VAX system, but
           you are more likely to need it on a MicroVAX.

           Message Router Version 3.5 requires the following classes
           of OpenVMS files:

           o  OpenVMS Required Saveset

     2-2 Preparing to Install Message Router

 






              o  Network Support

              o  Programming Support

              o  Secure User's Environment

              o  Utilities

              If any of these classes are missing, use the OpenVMS
              Tailoring utility (VMSTAILOR) to install them. Refer to
              OpenVMS Version 5.5 Upgrade and Installation Manual for
              details of VMSTAILOR.

        2.3 SYSTEM Account Quotas

              You must ensure that the SYSTEM account is set up with
              sufficient quota to install and run Message Router.
              Table 2-1 shows the minimum values applicable to the
              SYSTEM account.

              Table_2-1_Account_Quota_Values____________________________

              Account_______________Quota_______________________________

              PRCLM                    10

              TQELM____________________20_______________________________

              You can modify the account quotas using the Authorize
              utility. Refer to the VMS Authorize Utility Manual for
              details of how to do this. You need to log out and log in
              again for the new values to take effect.

     2.4 System Resource Requirements

           You must ensure that the SYSGEN parameters are set to
           allow sufficient quota to install and run Message Router.
           It is important that your system is tailored before
           you make the checks. Tables 2-2 and 2-3 show the SYSGEN
           parameters required by Message Router.

           Before you begin the installation, ensure that the system
           parameter settings are sufficiently high, taking into
           consideration the requirements of other applications on
           your system.

           Table_2-2_SYSGEN_Parameter_Values_________________________

              PQL_MTQELM_______________20_______________________________

              To modify the values for any of these parameters, edit the
              file
              SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT. For the GBLPAGES, GBLSECTIONS
              and GBLPAGFIL parameters, make incremental changes
              to the parameter values by including ADD_parameter in
              MODPARAMS.DAT; for example, ADD_GBLPAGES=6000.

              For the other parameters, specify minimum values for the
              parameters by including MIN_parameter in MODPARAMS.DAT;
              for example,
              MIN_PQL_MASTLM=24.

              Run AUTOGEN to recalculate and set your system parameters.
              Type:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN SAVPARAMS SETPARAMS [NO]FEEDBACK

              The next time you reboot your system these parameters take
              effect.

        2.5 Completing Preparation

              Follow these steps before invoking VMSINSTAL:

              1. Log in to the privileged system manager's account.

              2. Back up your system disk.

                 If a system failure occurs at a critical point during
                 the installation, some files may be corrupted. Also,
                 you are given the choice of purging old files during
                 the installation.

              3. Ensure that there are at least 19000 blocks available
                 on the system disk for the installation of Message
                 Router. A new installation of Message Router needs
                 9000 blocks on the system disk and 30000 blocks on the
                 target disk. You may need more space on the target disk
                 if you have a large message area.

                                 Preparing to Install Message Router 2-5

 






           4. Make sure you have enough disk space to hold your
              expected message traffic. In addition to the Message
              Router software, Message Router needs disk space to
              hold messages, directory database files, and queue
              files in its database. You need to estimate your
              expected message traffic and make sure that you have
              enough disk space to hold these messages.

              As a guide, the initial software in the Message Router
              directories needs approximately 1000 blocks of disk
              space. Allow a further 29000 for messages and database
              files.

           5. If you have not already done so, check that there
              are no active users on the system using the following
              command:

              $ SHOW USERS

              The system lists the active users currently on the
              system.

              If there are any users active on the system, ask them
              to log out by typing:

              $ REPLY /BELL /USERNAME "PLEASE LOG OUT"

           6. You may want to keep a record of the installation
              procedure. You can do this either by using the
              operator's console, which is usually a hardcopy
              terminal, or by keeping a log, as follows:

              $ SET HOST 0 /LOG=filename

              where filename is the name of the file that is to
              contain the installation log.

           7. If you are installing Message Router for the first time
              on the system, decide which device the Message Router
              directories (the MB$ directory tree) are to reside on
              initially. You are advised to use a device other than
              the system disk for the Message Router directories.

              The device name that you supply must be a logical
              device name and not a physical device name. For
              example, use USER1 and not $1$DUA1.

              You are recommended not to use a rooted logical, such
              as SYS$SYSROOT, as a device name.

     2-6 Preparing to Install Message Router

 






                 If you have already installed Message Router Version
                 3.2 or Version 3.3, you must continue to use the same
                 device for the Message Router directories.

                 Note the name of the device here:

                 _________________________________

              8. If you are installing Message Router for the first time
                 on the system, choose a user identification code (UIC)
                 for the MBMANAGER account and record it in the space
                 below. Do not choose a DECnet or system UIC; if you
                 do, the installation may fail. The UIC must be unique
                 to Message Router. Digital recommends that the Message
                 Router UIC is in a group of its own.

                 If you have already installed Message Router Version
                 3.2 or Version 3.3, you must continue to use the same
                 UIC for the MBMANAGER account.

                 UIC of the MBMANAGER account [________,________].

                 You must also choose a password for the MBMANAGER
                 account.

                 The password must contain at least eight and not more
                 than 31 characters.

              9. Ensure that you have started the system job queue
                 manager. Use the following command to see whether the
                 queue manager is running:

                 $ SHOW QUEUE /BATCH

                 If this command completes successfully, the queue
                 manager is running. If it does not, edit the system
                 startup file to include the following line:

                 $ START /QUEUE /MANAGER /BUFFER_COUNT=10 /EXTEND_QUANTITY=25

                 You can execute the above command immediately without
                 having to wait until the next system restart to start
                 the queue manager.

              If the DECnet PAK is not loaded and registered, refer to
              the VMS License Management Utility Manual for details
              of how to load and register it before starting the
              Installation Procedure.

           The rest of the preparation depends on the type of
           installation, as follows:

           o  If you are installing on a VAXcluster, see Section 2.6

           o  If you are upgrading from Version 3.2, 3.3 or
              reinstalling, see Section 2.7

           In all other cases, for example a new installation on a
           single node, you have finished preparing for installation.
           Turn to Chapter 3.

     2.6 Preparing to Install Message Router on a VAXcluster or
         Local Area VAXcluster

           This section describes ways of installing Message Router
           in a cluster. Refer to the VMS VAXcluster Manual for
           details of definitions and terminology used. The section
           also describes the different cluster configurations that
           you can set up for Message Router.

           If you are upgrading Message Router on a VAXcluster, make
           sure that you delete all versions of the MB$LOCATION.COM
           file from the SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSMGR] directory on all nodes
           in the cluster before you install Message Router V3.5.

           When you upgrade your Message Router system, you must
           re-create the configuration database when you first run
           the MAILbus[TM] Configuration Procedure on your V3.5
           system. To do this, use the MB$CONFIG CREATE MB command.
           Full instructions on how to do this are given in the VAX
           Message Router Configuration Guide.

           You can run Message Router on any OpenVMS Version 5.5-
           2 VAXcluster or Local Area VAXcluster configuration.
           However, you must make sure that the DECnet license is
           registered on each node in the cluster. (The VMS License
           Management Utility Manual describes how to register your
           license.)

           In a VAXcluster, all the nodes may share a single
           SYSUAF.DAT file and DECnet database or one group of nodes
           may share one set of resources, and another group may
           share a different set of resources. Also, in a cluster,
           there may be a single system disk or multiple system
           disks.

     2-8 Preparing to Install Message Router

 






              Irrespective of how your cluster is defined, there must be
              only one Message Router environment within the cluster.
              However, Message Router does not need to be installed and
              configured on all nodes in a cluster.

              Choose the set of nodes that you want Message Router
              to run on, and make sure you install it such that the
              installation satisfies the following two constraints:

              o  It modifies all the SYSUAF.DAT files and DECnet
                 databases that are shared by those nodes

              o  It modifies all the system disks that are used by those
                 nodes

              To satisfy both of these constraints, you may need to
              perform more than one installation. However, all the
              installations of Message Router on a cluster must use
              the same Message Router environment, that is, the same MB$
              directory structure and associated data files.

              When you have installed Message Router, you must configure
              it. As part of configuration you can choose whether to
              enable the use of the cluster alias, if one is defined.
              You can also choose to start a minimum set of Message
              Router processes on some of the nodes in the cluster.
              These options are described in the VAX Message Router
              Configuration Guide.

              If you are upgrading or reinstalling Message Router,
              continue at Section 2.7. Otherwise, turn to Chapter 3
              for details of the installation procedure.

        2.7 Further Preparations for an Upgrade Installation or
            Reinstallation

              You can upgrade to Message Router V3.5 from either V3.3 or
              V3.2. You cannot upgrade from earlier versions of Message
              Router to V3.5.

              Message Router runs on either DECnet/VAX Phase IV or
              DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX. However, Message Router
              does not accept node names longer than six characters.
              Therefore, the node name synonym database must be
              accessible when Message Router is running on DECnet/OSI
              for OpenVMS VAX.

                                 Preparing to Install Message Router 2-9

 






           It is not supported to run Message Router V3.5 on a
           VAXcluster[TM] that is running a mixture of DECnet/VAX
           Phase IV and DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX.

           Prepare your system for installation as follows:

           o  If Message Router is running, stop it and all MAILbus
              components with the following command:

              $ @SYS$MANAGER:MB$CONTROL STOP=(ER,...,DDS,TS,MS)

              where ... is a list of the identifiers of other MAILbus
              components that are installed on your system.

              You must use this command on every node in a VAXcluster.

              If you are reinstalling Message Router Version 3.5 and
              have customized any files to your own requirements,
              do not select purging in Step 3 in Section 3.2. After
              installation, you will find a later version of the
              files superseding your customized version. To use
              your customized files, check that they meet your
              requirements and then delete the newer version of the
              files you do not need.

           o  Back up your queue file, MRMAILBOX.DAT, mailbox direc-
              tory file,
              MRMDIRECT.DAT, and message file(s), MRn.NBS. If a
              system failure occurs at a critical point during the
              installation, some files may be corrupted.

           o  Back up the Directory Service database directory,
              [MB$.DDS.DB], in case of system failure during the
              installation.

           o  During the installation, you are given the option of
              purging files from a previous installation. If you
              purge your files, as recommended, you must also remove
              the following jobs from the batch queue:

              -  MR$TIDY.COM

              -  DDS$TIDY.COM

              -  DDS$DEFER.COM

              -  DDS$REFRESH.COM

     2-10 Preparing to Install Message Router

 






                 If you do not remove all these jobs from the batch
                 queues, they will fail when they execute, because the
                 files they refer to have been purged.

                 To remove these jobs from the batch queue, type the
                 following commands:

                 $ SHOW QUEUE queuename /ALL

                 where queuename is the name of the batch queue the jobs
                 are running on. The default queue name is MB$BATCH.

                 This shows the list of all the jobs queued to run on
                 the specified batch queue.

                 Examine the queue for the above entries and make a note
                 of the entry numbers. You can delete the entries from
                 the queue by typing:

                 $ DELETE /ENTRY=entrynumber queuename

                 where entrynumber is the entry number noted and
                 queuename is the name of the batch queue. Delete each
                 entry noted.

              o  If you were running exception reporting in your
                 previous installation, you must also delete the
                 following jobs:

                 -  MB$NET from the batch queue MB$BATCH_nodename

                 -  MB$DDS from the batch queue MB$BATCH_nodename

                 -  MB$TS from the batch queue MB$BATCH_nodename

                 where nodename is the name of the node you are using.

                 You must delete these jobs for each node in the
                 cluster.

              o  If you are upgrading Message Router, you must install
                 Message Router Version 3.5 on the same device as
                 Message Router Version 3.3. If you want to move either
                 all or part of Message Router to another disk, use
                 the configuration procedure, MB$CONFIG. Refer to the
                 VAX Message Router Configuration Guide for information
                 about moving Message Router files.

              Turn to Chapter 3.

                                               Installing Message Router



        3.1 Starting the Installation

              This chapter explains how to install Message Router. It is
              assumed that you have completed the preparations described
              in Chapter 2 before you install Message Router. If you
              have not registered and loaded the DECnet PAK, refer to
              the VMS License Management Utility Manual.

              VMSINSTAL is interactive and takes you step by step
              through the installation. Each step is fully described
              in this chapter. Remember that you can get on-line help by
              typing a question mark (?) in response to a prompt.

              With the exception of the VMSINSTAL command (shown below)
              to install Message Router V3.5, the installation procedure
              is the same as for Message Router V3.3. Refer to the
              VAX Message Router Installation Guide for details of the
              installation procedure.

              Customers who have Message Router V3.2 or later can
              upgrade to V3.5 directly. Customers who have earlier
              Versions need to install atleast V3.2 and then upgrade
              to V3.5.

              If possible keep a log of the installation procedure. To
              do this type:

              $ SET HOST 0 /LOG=filename

              where filename is the name of the file that is to contain
              the installation log.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Do not use the VMSINSTAL alternate root option,
                OPTION R. Message Router does not support this

           1. Log in to the SYSTEM account and type the following
              command:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL MR035 device OPTIONS N

              where:

              a. MR035 identifies the product being installed

              b. device is the name of the device where the
                 distribution medium is to be mounted, for example,
                 MTA0

              c. OPTIONS N provides the option of reading or printing
                 the on-line release notes

              ________________________Note ________________________

              If this is a reinstallation of Message Router
              Version 3.5, you can omit the parameter OPTIONS
              N, if you have already read the release notes.

              _____________________________________________________

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                 If the system disk has not recently been backed up,
                 type NO to abort the installation, and make a backup
                 copy. Otherwise, press RETURN to accept the default
                 answer of YES.

              5. The procedure instructs you to mount the distribution
                 volume:

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on device

                 * Are you ready?

                 where device is the device name you supplied in step 1.

                 Mount the first distribution volume on the device. When
                 you have mounted the distribution volume, type YES.

              6. The procedure confirms that the volume has been
                 successfully mounted and displays:

              the procedure displays:

              * Queue name[SYS$PRINT]:

              Enter the name of a print queue. The procedure then
              displays a message indicating that the release notes
              have been successfully queued to the printer. If you do
              not specify a print queue, the output is directed to
              SYS$PRINT by default.

           8. The procedure asks:

              * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]?

              You are advised to exit from the installation and read
              the release notes. Press RETURN to accept the default
              answer of NO. Otherwise, type YES.

              When you have read the release notes, you can restart

        4.1 Introduction

              The installation verification procedure (IVP) checks
              that all components of Message Router have been installed
              correctly. If you selected the IVP in the installation,
              VMSINSTAL automatically runs the IVP when the installation
              is completed. It is advisable to select the IVP because it
              checks that Message Router has been installed properly.

              The IVP sets up a test database to check that the
              installation is correct, so you do not need to configure
              Message Router before running the IVP.

              A successful IVP does not mean that Message Router is
              ready to use. Before you use Message Router, you must
              use the MAILbus Configuration Procedure, MB$CONFIG,
              to configure or reconfigure Message Router to your own
              requirements. See the VAX Message Router Configuration
              Guide for details of how to configure or reconfigure
              Message Router.

              The IVP produces a message to either confirm that all com-
              ponents of Message Router have been installed successfully
              or to indicate that it has failed. Section 4.3 provides
              more information about the success and failure messages.

        4.2 Running the IVP

              If you requested to run the IVP, VMSINSTAL runs it. The
              following is an example of the display from the IVP:

                              IVP   for   Message  Router

               This is the installation verification procedure (IVP) for Message
               Router. It checks that the components of Message Router are
               installed successfully on your system.

                           TRANSFER SERVICE V3.5-317 IVP

                   This is the installation verification procedure (IVP) for the
                   Transfer Service. It tests whether or not the Transfer Service

                   is successfully installed on your system.
                   The procedure starts by checking that all the files for the
                   Transfer Service exist and are the correct size. It then
                   starts MRMAN.

                   The verification procedure creates a test mailbox, using the
                   MRMAN utility, and sends a test message to the mailbox.

                   The verification procedure fetches the test message from the
                   mailbox and displays it, and then shuts down MRMAN.

                   The IVP has not completed successfully until you have
                   received this test message.

              If the IVP fails, but does not indicate the reason for the
              failure, you can set VERIFY on the installation procedure,
              so that the IVP displays more information on your screen.

              You can specify the component of Message Router you want
              verified by using one of the following commands before
              starting the installation procedure:

              $ VFY$TSCVP=1
              $ VFY$DDSVP=1
              $ VFY$MBMBVP=1

              where:

              o  TSCVP specifies the Transfer Service component

              o  DDSVP specifies the Directory Service component

              o  MBMBVP specifies the Management Service component

              You can use any or all of these commands before the same
              installation procedure. You then install Message Router in
              the usual way.

              Turn to Chapter 5 for details of what to do after a
              successful installation.

                                                  After the Installation



              After the installation has been completed, you should:

              1. Pass on details of the installation to the person doing
                 the configuration. Specifically, note the name of the
                 device on which you installed Message Router and pass
                 this information to the person who will be configuring
                 Message Router.

              2. Tune some of the system values to enhance performance
                 for your users. Details of how to tune your OpenVMS
                 system are given in the Guide to VMS Performance
                 Management.

              3. Remove any unwanted OpenVMS utilities or files using
                 VMSTAILOR, see Section 5.1.

              When you have completed the tasks you can install
              other MAILbus components, as described in the relevant
              installation guides, or you can configure Message Router
              Version 3.5 as described in the VAX Message Router
              Configuration Guide. You cannot run Message Router unless
              it is configured.

              Specifically, on a VAXcluster you can choose whether to
              enable the use of the cluster alias, if one is defined.
              You can also choose to start a minimum set of Message
              Router processes on some of the nodes in the cluster.
              These options are described in the VAX Message Router
              Configuration Guide.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Before you can install the Message Router X.400
                Gateway (MRX) you must configure Message Router.

                                              After the Installation 5-1

 






              However, you can install the other MAILbus Gateways
              before you configure Message Router.

     5.1 Tailoring OpenVMS

           The Object and Shareable Image Libraries are needed only
           during the installation of Message Router. As they are
           not needed to run Message Router, you can release some
           disk space by removing them from your VAX or MicroVAX. If
           you are using a MicroVAX, releasing disk space might be
           particularly useful.

           To remove the libraries from your system, first check
           that no one is using the software. If it is not being
           used, log in to the SYSTEM account and use the OpenVMS
           Tailoring Utility (VMSTAILOR) to tailor the software off
           your system. Refer to OpenVMS Version 5.5 Upgrade and
           Installation Manual for details of VMSTAILOR.

              This appendix contains example logs of an installation
              of Message Router on OpenVMS Version 5.5-2. There are
              minor differences between an installation log on a node
              where DECnet is running and on a node where DECnet/OSI is
              running. This appendix contains examples of both logs.

                        TRANSFER SERVICE V3.5-317 IVP

                This is the installation verification procedure (IVP) for the
                Transfer Service. It tests whether or not the Transfer Service
                is successfully installed on your system.
                The procedure starts by checking that all the files for the
                Transfer Service exist and are the correct size. It then
                starts MRMAN.

                The verification procedure creates a test mailbox, using the
                MRMAN utility, and sends a test message to the mailbox.

                The verification procedure fetches the test message from the
                mailbox and displays it, and then shuts down MRMAN.

                The IVP has not completed successfully until you have
                received this test message.

              This appendix contains a description of the Message Router
              Directory structure and location of the Message Router
              files. It also lists the Message Router images that are
              installed with privileges.

              Figure C-1 shows the directory structure of the Message
              Router software.

              Tables C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4 show the files that are
              installed by Message Router. When you have completed
              the installation, the Message Router software occupies
              about 10000 blocks of disk space. The file protection
              codes are the recommended settings that are issued in the
              distribution kit.

              For Version 3.5 reinstallations, any existing messages are
              moved to new message areas. Standard files are moved into
              the new database structure, but the old directories (with
              any extra files they held) are not deleted.

              Table C-5 shows the Message Router images that are in-
