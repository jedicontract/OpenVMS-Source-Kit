        ________________________________________________________________

                                                                 Preface



              The DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport (called
              the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST or Gateway-ST in this manual)
              is a hardware and software system that provides an
              interface between IBM and Digital Equipment Corporation
              networks that use SDLC lines and circuits. By handling the
              different communications protocols between an IBM network
              and a Digital network, the Gateway-ST enables certain
              nodes in a Digital DECnet network to communicate with one
              or more hosts in an IBM SNA network.

              The Gateway-ST software runs on either the four-port DEC
              MicroServer (DEMSA) or single-port DEC MicroServer-SP
              (DEMSB).

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Throughout this manual, the hardware server box is
                referred to generically. Where differences occur,
                distinctions between the
                DEC MicroServer (the four-port server product)
                and the DEC MicroServer-SP (the single-port server
                product) are noted.

                _____________________________________________________

              This manual tells you how to install the Gateway-ST and
              Gateway-ST Management software on an OpenVMS host, how to
              configure the system, and how to load the software into
              the DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-SP. Use this manual
              in conjunction with other Digital and IBM documentation.

     Intended Audience

           This manual is written for Digital system or network
           managers responsible for planning and installing a
           Gateway-ST system.

     New Features

           This release of DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous
           Transport enables the loading of software from DECnet
           /OSI for OpenVMS V5.6, and is also available for OpenVMS
           VAX as of V1.2 ECO3.

     Document Structure

           This document contains the following sections:

           o  Chapter 1, Before Installing the Gateway-ST, explains
              how you should plan and prepare for product installa-
              tion.

           o  Chapter 2, Installing the Gateway-ST and Gateway-ST
              Management Software, explains how you should install
              the software on the DECnet node(s) that you plan to use
              as a load host.

           o  Chapter 3, Configuring the Gateway-ST, explains how to
              configure the Gateway-ST once you have installed the
              software. This chapter also lists the IBM information
              required during configuration.

           o  Chapter 4, Loading the Gateway-ST Software, explains
              how to load the Gateway-ST system image from the load
              host to the Gateway-ST hardware.

           The postage-prepaid Reader's Comments form on the last
           page of this document requests the user's critical
           evaluation to assist us in preparing future documentation.

           When you issue NCP, NCL, and SNANCP commands, many
           component names, parameters, and qualifiers require
           additional information. In most cases, the syntax of this
           additional information follows a standard set of rules.
           (Exceptions to these rules are noted where appropriate.)

                                        Before Installing the Gateway-ST



              The DECnet SNA Gateway-ST is a system of hardware and
              software that handles the protocol differences between IBM
              SNA networks and Digital DECnet networks. Access routines
              such as the DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator (TE) for
              OpenVMS use the Gateway-ST to access IBM applications
              and programs. Version 1.2 of this software combines
              management and Gateway-ST software in a single package.
              This chapter discusses the planning and preparation needed
              for a Gateway-ST installation.

              Gateway-ST system installation has four parts:

              1. Installing the Gateway-ST hardware (see Installing the
                 DEC MicroServer or Installing the DEC MicroServer-SP).

              2. Installing the Gateway-ST software, including
                 management (see Chapter 2).

              3. Configuring the Gateway-ST system (see Chapter 3).

              4. Loading the Gateway-ST software (see Chapter 4).

              Before installing a Gateway-ST system, you must make
              preparations to ensure that all parts of the Gateway-
              ST system work cooperatively and efficiently. As part of
              your preparation, determine the major application of the
              Gateway-ST. The application affects how you configure your
              Gateway-ST system.

           After determining your application, you must identify what
           hardware and software you need in each of the following
           areas:

           o  IBM SNA network

           o  DECnet network

           o  DECnet SNA Gateway-ST

           o  Communications equipment

     1.1 Preparing the IBM SNA Environment

           To allow the DECnet SNA access routines to communicate
           with an IBM SNA network through the Gateway-ST, you
           have to prepare certain software components in the
           IBM environment. The DECnet SNA Gateway-ST Guide to
           IBM Parameters identifies the IBM parameters required
           for successful communication between the IBM host and
           the Gateway-ST. To ensure that the IBM parameters are
           correctly defined, the IBM system administrator must
           be familiar with the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST Guide to
           IBM Parameters. This book contains a checklist of the
           information and parameters the system programmer must use
           to set up the IBM system. For details of how IBM parameter
           settings affect parameter settings for various Gateway
           components, see Chapter 3 of this manual.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              Since IBM system programmers reconfigure and
              generate their systems according to a set schedule,
              give them as much advance notice as possible to
              prepare for the Gateway-ST installation.

              _____________________________________________________

     1.2 Preparing the DECnet Environment

           Before installing the Gateway-ST software, you must
           identify the DECnet nodes where you will install Gateway
           Management and Gateway-ST software. Make sure these nodes
           are properly configured.

     1-4 Before Installing the Gateway-ST

 






              A DECnet SNA network has the following DECnet nodes:

              o  Gateway node: The DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-SP
                 that serves as the Gateway-ST hardware base. (Although
                 the Gateway itself is a DECnet node, this manual refers
                 to it as the Gateway node rather than a DECnet node.)

              o  Gateway load host node: The DECnet node on which you
                 install the Gateway-ST software. This is the node from
                 which you load the Gateway-ST system image into the
                 DEC MicroServer hardware. Because the Gateway load host
                 node must contain the Gateway management software, you
                 must install the complete Gateway-ST software package
                 on this node.

              o  Access node: A DECnet node with one or more access
                 routine products (for example, DECnet SNA Data Transfer
                 Facility) installed. A DECnet SNA network can have one
                 or more access nodes. A Gateway load host node can also
                 be an access node.

                 For information on installing DECnet SNA access routine
                 software, see the documentation for the respective
                 product.

        1.2.1 Gateway Node

              The Gateway-ST can run on either a single-port or four-
              port version of the DEC MicroServer. When running on the
              single port DEC MicroServer-SP, Gateway-ST V1.2 software
              can support a single synchronous line operating up to
              19.2K bps. This hardware base supports up to 32 concurrent
              sessions running on GAS, and 16 concurrent sessions
              running on RJE or DHCF servers. Table 1-1 outlines the
              maximum session support when using the DEC MicroServer-
              SP.

           up to 256K bps. This hardware base supports any DECnet
           SNA access routine that uses GAS, RJE, or DHCF servers.
           Table 1-2 outlines the maximum session support when using
           the DEC MicroServer.

           Refer to the installation guide packaged with the DEC
           MicroServer or the DEC MicroServer-SP for details on
           specific hardware requirements.

     1.2.2 Gateway Load Host Node

           You must install the complete Gateway-ST software package
           on a Gateway load host node. In environments where
           reliability is critical, you should install the Gateway
           software on at least one additional load host. All load
           hosts must have the complete Gateway-ST software package
           installed.

     1-6 Before Installing the Gateway-ST

 






              The second load host can load the software to the Gateway
              node if the first load host is unavailable. The second
              load host can also receive dumps from the Gateway node.
              You can use any DECnet node as a load host for the
              Gateway-ST provided the node is running OpenVMS VAX V5.4
              (or later), or OpenVMS AXP V1.5, and the node is connected
              to the same Ethernet as the Gateway node.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Refer to the DECnet/OSI Network Management book for
                DECnet/OSI information.

                _____________________________________________________

              Before you begin the installation (on DECnet/VAX), do the
              following:

              1. Check that the load host is physically connected to the
                 Ethernet cable.

              2. Verify the status of the load host's Ethernet line and
                 circuit with the following NCP commands:

                 NCP>SHOW LINE line-id STATUS
                 NCP>SHOW CIRCUIT circuit-id STATUS

                 where

                 line-id   UNA-n, QNA-n, or BNA-n, depending on your system.

                 circuit-  UNA-n, QNA-n, or BNA-n, depending on your system.
                 id

                 The line and circuit must both be ON. If they are not,
                 use the NCP SET LINE and SET CIRCUIT commands to set
                 them to the ON state.

              3. Check the DECnet definition of the load host's Ethernet
                 line and circuit with the following NCP commands:

                 NCP>SHOW LINE line-id CHARACTERISTICS
                 NCP>SHOW CIRCUIT circuit-id CHARACTERISTICS

                 where

                 line-id   UNA-n, QNA-n, or BNA-n, depending on your system.

              circuit-  UNA-n, QNA-n, or BNA-n, depending on your system.
              id

              The preceding commands display parameters for the line
              and circuit you specify. Table 1-3 shows the default
              values for some of these parameters. If the parameters
              for your line and circuit do not correspond to the
              values shown, you can change these values with NCP
              commands.

           4. Check that there is enough free disk space to install
              and use the Gateway software. Installation requires a
              minimum of 5250 free blocks. If you are installing just
              the management portion of the
              Gateway-ST, the system still requires 5250 free
              blocks for installation, but only 1700 blocks for
              VAX, and 2250 blocks for AXP are allocated after the
              installation is complete. See Section 2.1.4 for further
              details.

           5. Enable event logging at the DECnet load host if not
              already enabled. Event logging records all system
              and network events or errors. Event logging is also
              used to diagnose problems that might occur with the
              Gateway. Use the NCP SET LOGGING command to enable
              event logging. For complete information on DECnet event
              logging, refer to the OpenVMS Networking Manual.

        1.2.3 Access Nodes

              The access nodes must be running the OpenVMS version
              required by the individual access routine. Digital
              Equipment Corporation recommends installing Gateway
              Management software on any access node running an
              application programming interface access routine.

              For information on installing individual access routines,
              refer to the appropriate documentation for that software
              product.

        1.3 Preparing Communications Equipment

              The following sections discuss possible combinations of
              communications equipment you can use for the Gateway-ST.
              For further information about the products available to
              you, consult your Digital sales representative.

        1.3.1 Connecting the Gateway-ST to Ethernet

              As a node in an Ethernet local area network (LAN), the
              Gateway-ST can be either directly or indirectly connected
              to the Ethernet. For direct connection to the Ethernet
              cable, use an Ethernet transceiver, such as an H4005. The
              H4005 transceiver, with its accessories, connects a single
              system to the Ethernet cable.

              For indirect connection to the Ethernet cable, use a Local
              Network Interconnect (DELNI). A DELNI can group together
              more than one Ethernet device and can then connect the
              devices to the Ethernet using a single line.

              These two types of local area network connections appear
              the same to the Gateway user.

        1.3.2 Connecting the Gateway-ST to the SNA Network

              The following sections describe the line support available
              when using the DEC MicroServer-SP or the DEC MicroServer.





                                    Before Installing the Gateway-ST 1-9

 






           DEC MicroServer-SP Line Support

           The line interface that connects the DEC MicroServer-SP
           to the IBM SNA network has one port for one synchronous
           communication link. The DEC MicroServer-SP can handle
           data communications speeds of up to 19.2K bps. Table 1-4
           shows the line configuration available with the DEC
           MicroServer-SP.

           Table_1-4_DEC_MicroServer-SP_Port_Speeds__________________

           Data Speeds           Number
           (in_bits_per_second)__of_Lines____Ports___________________

           Up_to_19.2K_bps_______1___________0_______________________

           DEC MicroServer Line Support

           The line interface that connects the DEC MicroServer
           to the IBM SNA network has four ports for up to four
           synchronous communication links. The DEC MicroServer can
           handle data communication speeds of up to 256K bps. The
           range of speeds is divided into three bands. In each band,
           a certain number of the synchronous ports are available
           for use. Table 1-5 shows the three speed bands, the number
           of ports available in each band, and the identification of
           these ports.

           Table_1-5_DEC_MicroServer_Port_Speeds_____________________

           Data Speeds           Number
           (in_bits_per_second)__of_Lines____Ports___________________

           Up to 64K             4           0,1,2,3

           Above 64K to 128K     2           0 and 1

           Above_128K_to_256K____1___________0_only__________________

           Use the information in the preceding table in the
           following way:

           1. Determine the maximum line speed you wish to use.

           2. Locate the band for that speed in the table.

           3. Use only the ports listed for your speed band.

     1-10 Before Installing the Gateway-ST

 






              For example, if you use one line at 64K bps and another at
              128K bps, the maximum data speed lies in the middle band
              and only two ports (0 and 1) can be used. Therefore, using
              a third port at 9600 bps is not supported.









































                                   Before Installing the Gateway-ST 1-11

 






     1.3.3 Modems

           The SDLC lines used with the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST must be
           attached to a modem, modem eliminator, or an IBM direct
           attach line. The type of modem or modem eliminator you
           need for each line depends on factors such as line speed,
           duplex setting of the line, distance between modems, and
           data transfer rate. (For example, a Bell 2096 modem can
           be used at 9.6K bps full duplex on most networks.) You
           can use any modem that provides synchronous communication
           at between 2.4K bps and 256K bps on full-duplex or half-
           duplex lines. Each communication link connects ultimately
           to an IBM 37xx communications controller.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              The Gateway-ST does not provide internal clocking.
              The Gateway-ST clock parameter internal setting is
              for diagnostic purposes only. The clock parameter
              is set to external as part of the configuration
              procedures supplied with Gateway-ST.

              _____________________________________________________

     1.3.4 Adapter Cables

           The synchronous communication ports on the Gateway-ST are
           identical: each is a 50-pin male connector. Depending on
           modem type, you need one of the adapter cables listed in
           Table 1-6 to connect the port to the modem:

           Table_1-6_Modem_Adapter_Cables____________________________

           Modem         Part

                                   232-C interface with adapter. The
                                   adapter enables the adapter cable
                                   to be used on RS-232-C lines.

                                      Installing the Gateway-ST Software



              This chapter explains how to use VMSINSTAL to install
              the Gateway-ST software on the load host. Gateway-ST V1.2
              combines Gateway management software with the Gateway-
              ST software. Gateway management software allows you to
              configure, manage, and down-line load the Gateway-ST after
              the initial installation.

              For information on installing DECnet SNA access routine
              software, see the documentation for the respective
              product.

        2.1 Preparing to Install the Gateway-ST Software

              Before you start an installation that involves writing to
              your system disk, Digital Equipment Corporation recommends
              that you make a backup copy of your system disk.

              Your bill of materials (BOM) specifies the number and
              contents of your media. Check the contents of your kit
              against the list in the BOM. If your kit is damaged or if
              parts are missing, call your Digital representative.

              Distribution volumes must be mounted in numerical order.
              The installation procedure will prompt you to mount the
              volumes in proper sequence.

              For more information on mounting the distribution media,
              see the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual for your system.
              This manual describes several options to the installation
              procedure.

     2.1.1 OpenVMS System Tailoring

           The DECnet SNA Gateway-ST software supports OpenVMS
           tailoring for installation on systems with limited system
           disk space. See the section on OpenVMS tailoring in the
           DECnet SNA Gateway-ST SSA (System Support Addendum) for
           a list of necessary OpenVMS system classes. For more
           information on classes and OpenVMS tailoring, see the
           OpenVMS operating system Software Product Description
           (SPD).

     2.1.2 Prerequisite Software and Licensing

           Version 1.2 of the Gateway-ST requires OpenVMS VAX
           Version 5.4, or OpenVMS AXP Version 1.5, including the
           corresponding version of DECnet. You must install the
           management software on every node that will contain the
           Gateway-ST software.

           Gateway-ST V1.2 supports the OpenVMS License Management
           Facility (LMF), which requires that a Product Authorization
           Key (PAK) be registered and loaded before you start the
           Gateway-ST. Required registration information is contained
           on the PAK sheet shipped with the Gateway-ST.

           To register a license number under OpenVMS, log into the
           system manager account, SYSTEM. You can choose either of
           the following two ways to perform the registration:

           o  At the DCL prompt, invoke SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM.
              When it prompts you for information, respond with the
              information from your PAK form.

           o  At the DCL prompt, issue the LICENSE REGISTER DCL
              command with the qualifiers that correspond to the
              PAK information.

           For complete information on using LMF, see the manual on
           the License Management Utility in the OpenVMS VAX V5.4, or
           OpenVMS AXP V1.5 documentation sets.

        2.1.3 On-Line Release Notes

              The Gateway-ST installation kit provides on-line release
              notes. A prompt to display or print the release notes
              appears when you run VMSINSTAL with the OPTIONS N
              parameter. You can read the release notes by displaying
              or printing the file SYS$HELP:SNACSTnnn.RELEASE_NOTES,
              where nnn represents the major version number and all
              maintenance updates in that version. The first and second
              digits represent the major version number, the third digit
              represents the maintenance update version number. For
              example, SNACST012.RELEASE_NOTES correspond to Version 1.2
              of the Gateway-ST software.

        2.1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements

              Before you install the Gateway-ST software, verify that
              the following installation requirements have been met:

           The Gateway-ST installation also requires the following:

           o  A unique node name and address for the Gateway node.

           o  NETPROXY.DAT, SYSUAF.DAT, and RIGHTSLIST.DAT located in
              SYS$SYSTEM, or you have defined system logical names
              that point to the location of the files.

           o  For DECnet/OSI, you must also grant the NET$MANAGE
              rights identifier to the account from which the
              configuration SNACSA$CONFIGURE.COM is being performed.
              The procedure will prompt you for this, and will not
              run until the identifier is granted.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              If NETPROXY.DAT and RIGHTSLIST.DAT do not exist,
              you have the option of creating them during the
              Gateway-ST installation.

              _____________________________________________________

           For background information on installing optional
           products on an OpenVMS system, refer to the OpenVMS System
           Manager's Manual.

           Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
           your current system quota values with those required for
           the Gateway-ST. The following example uses an account
           called SYSTEM.

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Ret>
           $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Ret>

        2.2 Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for the
              DECnet SNA Gateway-ST verifies the installation. During
              the installation, you are asked if you want to run the
              IVP as part of the installation. If you respond YES,
              VMSINSTAL runs the IVP. It is recommended that you run
              the IVP to ensure that the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST software
              is installed correctly.

              After the Gateway-ST software is installed, you can run
              the IVP independently to verify that the software is
              available on your system. For example, if the Gateway-
              ST fails to load, or fails to load properly, you can run
              the IVP to assist in determining the cause of the problem.

              The IVP for the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST is a command
              procedure that is stored in the directory SYS$TEST after
              you install the software. To run the IVP interactively
              after the installation, issue the following command:

              $ @SYS$TEST:SNACST$IVP

              Executing this command procedure runs the IVP independent
              of the installation procedure.

     2.3 Installing Files on an OpenVMS System

           The procedure for installing files on an OpenVMS system
           is automated. You simply answer questions displayed while
           VMSINSTAL runs. Most questions require a simple yes (Y)
           or no (N) answer. The questions display default answers
           (where available) in the following way:

           [YES]:

           To answer a question with the default YES, press <Ret>.

           To install the distribution kit on your OpenVMS host, do
           the following:

           o  Log in to the system manager's account.

           o  Ensure that all users are logged out and all batch jobs
              are complete.

           o  Disable logins and DECnet.

           o  Check that you have backed up the system disk.

           o  Verify that you have at least 5250 free blocks on the
              system disk.

        2.3.1 Using VMSINSTAL

              VMSINSTAL is a command procedure that installs OpenVMS
              layered software products. The VMSINSTAL command line has
              the following format:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SNACSTnnn ddcu: [OPTIONS N]

              nnn
              Represents the major version number and all maintenance
              updates in that version. The first and second digits
              represent the major version number, and the third digit
              represents the maintenance update version number. For
              the version number of your kit, refer to the label on
              the distribution kit or the BOM. If you do not supply the
              product name and version number, VMSINSTAL prompts you for
              them.

              ddcu:
              Represents a device name for the Gateway-ST installation
              media; where dd is the device code, c is the controller
              id, and u is the unit number. It is not necessary to use
              the console drive. If you do not supply the device name,
              VMSINSTAL prompts you for it. MTA0: is the device name
              used in examples in this document.

              OPTIONS N
              Include this optional parameter if you want to display or
              print the release notes. If you do not include the OPTIONS
              N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not prompt you to display
              or print the release notes. It does, however, copy the
              release notes to SYS$HELP.

              When you install a product using VMSINSTAL, you have two
              installation options. You can either enter the VMSINSTAL
              command line specifying the product name, version number,
              device name, and release notes option as shown in the
              step-by- step procedure, or you can enter the following
              command:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL

              If you enter the preceding command, VMSINSTAL prompts you
              for the product name, version number, device name, and
              options during the installation.

     2.4 Installing the Software

           This section contains the script you see when running
           VMSINSTAL to install the Gateway-ST software. This section
           also contains explanatory text for each prompt.

           When you run VMSINSTAL, press the Return key <Ret> to
           accept the default value. Unless otherwise stated, end
           every command line by pressing <Ret>.

           If at any time during the installation, you want to
           terminate the procedure, press <Ctrl/Y>. This halts the
           installation procedure and deletes all files created up to
           that point. To restart the installation procedure after
           pressing <Ctrl/Y>, you must begin again from Step 2.

           Enhancements to VMSINSTAL in future releases of the
           OpenVMS operating system might result in additional
           prompts appearing during the course of the installation.
           Although such prompts might not be documented in this
           installation guide, the installation should proceed
           normally.

           Step 1: Log in to the system manager's account.

     <Ret>

           Username: SYSTEM <Ret>
           Password: password <Ret>

           Step 2: Invoke VMSINSTAL.

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SNACSTnnn MTA0: OPTIONS N <Ret>

           Replace nnn in the product name with the version number of
           the software, for example, SNACST012.

                 VAX/VMS Software Product Installation Procedure V5.4

           It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
           Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

           * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?<Ret>

           If you are satisfied with the backup of your system
           disk, press <Ret>. Otherwise, type N and press <Ret>
           to discontinue the installation. Make a backup of your
           system, and proceed from Step 2.

     2-8 Installing the Gateway-ST Software

 






              Step 3: Product installation begins.

              VMSINSTAL prompts you to mount the distribution kit
              volume.

              The following products will be processed:

                SNACST  Vn.n

               Beginning installation of SNACST Vn.n at hh:mm

              %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

              n.n is automatically replaced with the version number of
              the Gateway-ST software you provide in Step two, in this
              case V1.2.

              Step 4: Select a release notes option.

              The following prompts appear only if you specified OPTIONS
              N in Step 2.

              Release Notes Options:

                  1. Display release notes
                  2. Print release notes
                  3. Both 1 and 2
                  4. Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
                  5. Do not display, print, or copy release notes

              * Select option [2]: <Ret>

              If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes immediately on your screen. You can terminate the
              display at any time by pressing <Ctrl/C>.

              If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue
              name.

              * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Ret>

              Either type a queue name, or press <Ret> to send the file
              to the default output print device.

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a
              queue name and then displays the release notes. After
              the release notes display or print, the following prompt
              and message appear:

                                  Installing the Gateway-ST Software 2-9

 






           Do you want to continue the installation [NO]?: Y <Ret>
           %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A ...
           %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to
           SYS$HELP.

           To continue the installation, type Y and press <Ret>. If
           you type N and press <Ret> or just press <Ret>, VMSINSTAL
           stops the installation.





































     2-10 Installing the Gateway-ST Software

 






              Step 5: Select Software Installation Options

              The installation procedure now displays the Gateway-ST
              software installation options:

                  You can install:

                  [1] The Gateway management utilities
                  [2] The entire Gateway-ST kit (including management)

              * Enter an option [2]: <Ret>

              You have two installation options. The default selection
              (2), installs the entire Gateway-ST software kit. Press
              <Ret> to begin this process. Selecting the default option
              requires that the PAK be registered and loaded. Failure
              to do this causes the installation process to fail with
              an error message notifying you that the license must be
              installed. Refer to the PAK installation procedure in
              Chapter 1 for further details. In this event, you must
              restart the installation procedure.

              If you want to install just the Gateway-ST management
              software, enter 1 and press <Ret>. You do not require a
              license to install this option.

              Step 6: Starting Event Logging

              The installation procedure now prompts you to start event
              logging as follows:

              * Do you want to start the event logger on this node [YES]? <Ret>

                Add the following command to your system startup procedures:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNAGM$STARTUP

                You can edit SNAGM$STARTUP.COM if you wish to change whether or not
                the DECnet SNA Event Logger is run on this node or cluster.

              Press <Ret> to start event logging. If you want to
              manually start event logging later, type NO and press
              <Ret>. Because the event logger must be running for a
              DECnet node to log SNA Gateway event messages, Digital
              recommends that you start the event logger at this time.

                                 Installing the Gateway-ST Software 2-11

 






           Once you respond to the prompt for event logging, the
           installation procedure prompts you to add event logging
           and NETTRACE to your system startup file. Doing this
           causes event logging and NETTRACE to begin automatically
           at system startup.








































     2-12 Installing the Gateway-ST Software

 






              If you responded NO to event logging startup, the event
              logger command in SNAGM$STARTUP.COM is disabled. To enable
              the command at a later time, edit SNAGM$STARTUP.COM file
              and remove the exclamation point (!) from in front of the
              following command:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNAGM$EVL_STARTUP

              Step 7: Select NETPROXY options.

              The installation procedure now asks you a series of
              questions.

              * This product needs a DECnet proxy login database (NETPROXY)
              * Do you want to create NETPROXY.DAT [YES]? <Ret>
              %UAF-I-RDBCREMSG, NETPROXY.DAT created

              If you do not have a NETPROXY file, you must create it.
              The NETPROXY file contains the proxy login entries. If
              you type NO, the installation ends; the software is not
              installed.

              If you have a NETPROXY file, the NETPROXY option will not
              appear.

              * This product needs a rights database (RIGHTSLIST)
              * Do you want to create RIGHTSLIST.DAT [YES]? <Ret>
              %UAF-I-RDBCREMSG, RIGHTSLIST.DAT created

              If you do not have a RIGHTSLIST file, you must create
              it. The RIGHTSLIST file is the system rights identifier
              database. If you type NO, the installation ends; the
              software is not installed.

              If you have a RIGHTSLIST file, the RIGHTSLIST option will
              not appear.

        A directory and account must be created for use by the
        Gateway software. This account allows only network logins,
        and is used by the Gateway for execution of initialization
        procedures.  The account details are as follows:




                                 Installing the Gateway-ST Software 2-13

 






             Directory:      SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]
             Username:       SNA$CSV
             Password:       randomly generated
             UIC:            specified by you

     * UIC for SNA$CSV account [56,56]:<Ret>

     %VMSINSTAL-I-ACCOUNT, This installation creates an account named SNA$CSV.
     %UAF-I-ADDMSG, user record successfully added
     %UAF-I-RDBADDMSGU, identifier SNA$CSV value: [000056, 000056] added to RIGHTSLIST.DAT
     %VMSINSTAL-I-ACCOUNT, This installation updates an account named SNA$CSV.
     %UAF-I-MDFYMSG, user record(s) updated.
     %VMSINSTAL-I-SYSDISK, This product creates system disk directory VMI$ROOT: [SNA$CSV].
































     2-14 Installing the Gateway-ST Software

 






              You are then prompted to specify a UIC for the account
              where the configuration files reside. A default account of
              [56,56] is provided. If that default is acceptable, press
              <Ret>. You can specify a different UIC if you choose.
              However, for security reasons, make sure that you specify
              a unique UIC that is not a system UIC and is not in a
              group with any other UICs.

              You are prompted for a UIC only if the account does not
              already exist. If the account does exist, you are so
              informed, and no question is asked.

              A directory and an account are created for the configura-
              tion files. If the directory SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV] already
              exists, the Gateway-ST uses the existing directory. If
              the directory SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV] does not exist, it is
              created during the installation procedure.

              Step 8: Select the IVP option.

              The installation procedure now prompts you to run the
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP).

              You will be prompted to run the IVP as part of this installation, but you
              may also manually invoke the IVP at any time by issuing the command:

                  $ @SYS$MANAGER:SNACST$IVP

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? <Ret>

              The IVP runs tests to check whether the installation
              procedure was successful. Press <Ret> to run the IVP after
              the installation. If you do not want to run the IVP, type
              N <Ret> in response to the prompt.

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Ret>

              The system disk might contain previous versions of
              the Gateway-ST files. The files are replaced during
              installation with new files, but the old files are not
              automatically purged. Digital recommends purging. In
              response to the purging prompt, press <Ret> to purge the
              files, or type N to keep them.


                                 Installing the Gateway-ST Software 2-15

 






           Step 9: Read informational messages.

           The installation procedure now displays the following
           informational messages:

           No more questions...

           To create the initial configuration files for your Gateway, invoke the
           configuration procedure, thus:

                       $ @SYS$MANAGER:SNACST$CONFIGURE

           If this is an update to a previous version, invoke the above configuration
           procedure and execute PART 1 of the procedure only. This will define the
           gateway node and the new gateway system image in the LOAD HOST's database, but
           leave the GATEWAY's DECnet and SNA configuration files unchanged.

           %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories...

           If you typed Y in response to the prompt that requests a
           file purge (Step 8), previous versions of the files are
           now purged.

           If the installation procedure is successful, the exe-
           cutable files are moved to their target directory. Release
           notes are moved to SYS$HELP and named SNACST012.RELEASE_
           NOTES.

           Step 10: Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

           The installation procedure now calls the IVP to verify
           that the Gateway-ST software was successfully installed.
           The system displays the following messages:

           The DECnet SNA Gateway-ST Vn.n
           Installation Verification Procedure.

           The IVP checks that the directory SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV] was
           successfully created, that all Gateway files have been correctly
           installed from the kit, and that the username SNA$CSV was
           correctly set up.

           Executing the IVP ...
           Directory ok  ...

           Management files ok ...
           Gateway files ok...
           Username ok ...

           IVP for DECnet SNA Gateway-ST Vn.n completed successfully.

     2-16 Installing the Gateway-ST Software

 






              Step 11: End the installation procedure.

                      Installation of SNACST Vn.n completed at hh:mm

                      VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

              When the installation procedure is complete, you can
              continue to install more products or end the installation
              procedure. To end the procedure, press <Ctrl/Z> or the
              <Ret> key.

              VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process symbol
              tables during the installation. Therefore, if you are
              planning to continue using the system manager's account
              and want to restore those symbols, you should log out and
              log in again.

        2.5 Files Created or Modified During Installation

              The VMSINSTAL procedure for the Gateway-ST creates the

        2.8 Maintenance Updates

              Digital Equipment Corporation periodically issues
              maintenance updates of the Gateway-ST software. Each
              update consists of an installation kit. You should
              install this kit as described in this document or in any
              documentation that accompanies the maintenance update.

              Each time a maintenance update is released, the version
              number changes. For example, if the current version is
              1.1, the version number of the next maintenance update
              will be 1.2. In addition, the maintenance update usually
              includes release notes. The release notes describe the
              changes made to the Gateway-ST software since the previous
              release.

              The updated release notes are provided on line. You can
              read the release notes before you install the Gateway-ST
              software and at any time after the product is installed.
              For information on reading the release notes before the
              Gateway-ST software is installed, follow the installation
              procedure up to Step 4 (see Section 2.4). To read the
              release notes after installing the product, display or
              print the file SYS$HELP:SNACST012.RELEASE_NOTES.

                                                                       3

                                              Configuring the Gateway-ST



              After installing the entire Gateway-ST software kit on
              the load host, you must configure the Gateway-ST system.
              Digital provides a command procedure to assist you with
              the initial configuration. SNACST$CONFIGURE.COM performs
              the following steps by using both default information and
              information that you provide:

              1. Defines the Gateway node and SNAINI object in the load
                 host's DECnet database. A copy of the commands you need
                 to define the gateway node is saved in the following
                 file:

                 SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]DEFINE_gateway-node-name_ON_load-host-node-name.COM

                 This file remains on the system should you need to re-
                 execute the commands in the future; for example, if you
                 reconfigure DECnet.

              2. Creates and displays a command procedure that
                 configures the SNA components in the Gateway database.
                 This procedure contains SNANCP commands and has the
                 following file specification:

                 SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]SNAGATEWAY_gateway-node-name_SNA.COM

                 This file is used every time the Gateway-ST is
                 reloaded.

              3. Creates and displays a command procedure that
                 configures DECnet components in the Gateway-ST
                 database. This procedure contains NCP commands and
                 has the following file specification:

                 SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]SNAGATEWAY_gateway-node-name_DNA.COM

                 This file is used every time the Gateway-ST is
                 reloaded.

                                          Configuring the Gateway-ST 3-1

 






           After the Gateway-ST is initially configured and loaded,
           you can customize the configuration for your site. Digital
           provides SNANCP and NCP commands that you can enter
           interactively to change the characteristics of your
           system. For descriptions of how to use these commands,
           refer to
           DECnet SNA Gateway-CT and Gateway-ST Management.

           When you enter commands interactively, the definitions
           or changes you make take effect immediately. However,
           these definitions or changes stay in effect only while the
           Gateway-ST is running. When the Gateway-ST is reloaded,
           the values used are those in the command procedures that
           you created during the initial configuration.

           Digital suggests the following procedure for reconfiguring
           your Gateway-ST system. Use interactive commands to make
           changes to the Gateway-ST system while it is running.
           If you want to keep those changes, edit the appropriate
           command procedures to change the default values and reload
           the system.

     3.1 Preparing to Configure the Gateway-ST

           The Gateway-ST configuration procedure is in the file
           SNACST$CONFIGURE.COM in the SYS$MANAGER directory.
           During the execution of SNACST$CONFIGURE.COM, the system
           prompts you for information about the Gateway node, the
           Gateway components, and the Gateway DECnet database.
           Example 3-1 lists the specific information you need
           for communication between the Gateway-ST and the SNA
           network. Use Example 3-1 as a reference, and collect the

              appropriate information for each component you intend to
              define before running
              SNACST$CONFIGURE.COM.

        3.2 Configuring the Software

              The following sections display the prompts you see while
              running
              SNACST$CONFIGURE.COM and explain the information you are
              asked to provide.

              Once you have gathered the information shown in Example 3-1
              for each component you want to configure, you can start
              the configuration procedure.

              If you are upgrading your Gateway-ST software, complete
              part one in Section 3.2.1 only. You should skip over parts
              two and three by replying to the system prompts. If you
              are performing a completely new installation, you should
              complete all three steps.

              To run the configuration procedure, log in to the SYSTEM
              account, and then enter the following command:

              $ @SYS$MANAGER:SNACST$CONFIGURE

              To get help during the procedure, enter a ? (question
              mark) in response to any prompt that you do not un-
              derstand. Information about the prompt displays on the
              screen.

              When you run the configuration procedure, substitute
              your own values for the values shown. To take the default
              value, press the <Ret> key. Unless otherwise stated, end
              every command line by pressing <Ret>.

        3.2.1 Introductory Remarks

              When you start the configuration procedure, you see the
              following display:

                      SNACST$CONFIGURE V1.2 DECnet SNA Gateway-ST configuration procedure.

                      Configuration is divided into three parts:

                      .       Part 1: Define the Gateway node in the load host's
                                      DECnet database.

                      .       Part 2: Create a command file that will be used to
                                      configure the SNA database in the Gateway
                                      each time it is loaded.

                                          Configuring the Gateway-ST 3-5

 






                   .       Part 3: Create a command file that will be used to
                                   configure the DECnet database in the Gateway
                                   each time it is loaded.

                   This configuration procedure prompts you to see if you want
                   to run each of the three parts.  All parts must be completed
                   before the Gateway can be loaded. Enter "?" at any time for
                   help.

     3.2.2 Gateway Node Name

           DECnet SNA Gateway-ST node name  [] :

           When you see the prompt for a Gateway node name, type 1 to
           6 alphanumeric characters. The name must be unique within
           the DECnet network.

     3.2.3 Part 1: Information for the Gateway Node Definition

           The DECnet database on the load host needs information
           about the Gateway node for the following two processes:

           o  Loading the Gateway node

           o  Dumping from the Gateway node

           This part of the configuration also defines the SNAINI
           object and creates a proxy account for the Gateway-ST
           initialization. The proxy account maps the remote
           username, gateway_name::SNA$GO, to the local username,
           SNA$CSV.

           If you intend to use more than one member of an VMScluster
           as a load host, you must execute this part of the
           configuration procedure on each individual load host.
           This is necessary because the load host's DECnet SERVICE
           CIRCUIT parameter is hardware dependent.

           You see the following prompt at the beginning of Part 1:

           Define the Gateway node in load-host-name's DECnet database?
           (Y|N) [Y]:

           If you are certain that the load host already has the
           Gateway node definition, and that the SNAINI object and
           the appropriate proxy login information are defined (from
           a previous installation), type N. If you type Y, the

     3-6 Configuring the Gateway-ST

 






              system prompts you for the information in the following
              sections. The default answer is Y.

        3.2.3.1 DECnet Address of the Gateway Node

              DECnet node address of gateway-node-name ([aa.]nnnn) []:

              Specify the DECnet address of the Gateway node in the
              following way:

              aa    Specifies the (optional) DECnet area number and is a
                    decimal number ranging from 1 to 63.

              nnnn  Specifies the DECnet node number and is a decimal
                    number ranging from 1 to 1023.

        3.2.3.2 Dump File Device and Directory

              Device and directory for dump file [SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]]:

              Specify the device and directory on the load host that
              will contain the dump file if the Gateway node performs
              an up-line dump. The dump file is not created until it is
              required.

              The default device and directory is SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV].
              Ensure that the specified device always has enough free
              space for the dump file. Each version of the dump file is
              approximately 4500 blocks. If less than 4500 blocks are
              available on the specified device, a warning message is
              issued.

        3.2.3.3 Ethernet Hardware Address

              Ethernet hardware address (12 hex digits) []:

              Specify the Ethernet hardware address of the Ethernet
              port for the Gateway node. Enter this address either as 12
              hexadecimal digits or as six pairs of hexadecimal digits
              separated by hyphens. For example, these two expressions
              specify the same address:

                      08002B08E3BE
                      08-00-2B-08-E3-BE

                                          Configuring the Gateway-ST 3-7

 






     3.2.3.4 Ethernet Circuit

           Host's Ethernet circuit name (circuit-id) [dev-c]:

           Specify the name of the Ethernet circuit that connects
           the load host to the Gateway-ST. The Gateway node makes
           service requests for loading and dumping on this circuit.

     3.2.3.5 End of Part 1

           When you have answered all the questions for Part 1 of
           the configuration procedure, the following informational
           messages are displayed:

                   All questions for this section have been answered.

                   The following NCP commands will be used to define the Gateway
                   node and SNAINI object in the load host's DECnet database.
                   In addition, a proxy login will be established for the Gateway
                   initialization process.

           SNACST$CONFIGURE displays the commands that are used to
           define the Gateway node in the DECnet permanent database
           on the load host. The system then asks:

           Are you satisfied with these answers? (Y|N) [Y]:

           If you type Y, the command procedure that immediately
           follows the question executes the commands.

           If you type N, you can provide different values for the
           configuration.

              ________________________NOTE ________________________

              The following message might appear:

              %NONAME-W-NOMSG, Message number 00000000

              You can safely ignore this message.

              _____________________________________________________

           After the NCP commands execute, the following prompt
           appears:

           Do you wish to redo this section? (Y|N) [N]:

           If you type Y, this part of the configuration is run
           again, and you can provide different values for the items.
           N is the default.

     3-8 Configuring the Gateway-ST

 






              If you type N, you see the following message:

              The file you have created has been saved in:

              SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]DEFINE_gateway-node-name_ON_load-host-node-name.COM

              This command file may be used to redefine the Gateway node
              and SNAINI object in the load host's DECnet database,
              should you need to do so at some future time.

              You can now proceed to Part 2 of the configuration
              procedure.

        3.2.4 Part 2: Information About Gateway Components

              In Part 2 of the configuration procedure, you specify
              parameters for the following Gateway-ST components:

              o  Lines

              o  Circuits

              o  Physical units (PUs)

              o  Access names

              o  Servers

              The information you provide goes into the following
              configuration file in the form of SNANCP commands:

              SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]SNAGATEWAY_gateway-node-name_SNA.COM.

              This configuration file initializes the SNA components
              each time the Gateway-ST is loaded. You can edit this file
              to customize your configuration.

              If you edit this file, you must make sure that the state-
              ment that sets the line, circuit and PU characteristics
              appears before the statement that sets the line and
              circuit states to ON.

              At the beginning of Part 2 the system prompts you as
              follows:

              Do you wish to create this command file? (Y|N) [Y]:

                                          Configuring the Gateway-ST 3-9

 






           If you type Y, you are prompted to define the number of
           lines configured:

           Number of lines to be configured (1-4) [1]:

              ________________________Note ________________________

              If you are using a DEC MicroServer-SP, do not
              attempt to configure more than one line.

              _____________________________________________________

     3.2.4.1 Lines

           The line parameters in this section define the physical
           lines the Gateway uses to transfer data to the IBM
           communications controller.

           For each line you configure, you will see the following
           identifying banner:

                        +--------------------------+
                        |        Line SYN-n        |
                        +--------------------------+

           o  Line Duplex

              Is the line full duplex? (Y|N) [N] :

              The line duplex controls modem signaling. The duplex
              mode of the line can be HALF (half duplex) or FULL
              (full duplex). Type YES if you want the mode to be
              FULL. The mode must be the same as that defined for the
              IBM modem. To determine the IBM modem setting, refer to
              the DUPLEX and ADDRESS parameters for the IBM ACF/NCP
              LINE macro.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              This line duplex parameter sets only the physical
              characteristics of the communications line, not
              the data transfer mode. To set the data transfer
              mode, see the corresponding CIRCUIT parameter
              (Section 3.2.4.2).

              _____________________________________________________

              o  Multidropped

                 Is the line multidropped? (Y|N) [N]:

                 Specify the data line protocol to be used on the line.
                 Type Y (YES) if the line is a tributary end of a SDLC
                 multipoint link. Press <Ret> if the line is one end of
                 a point-to-point SDLC link.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                When using the Gateway-ST, half-duplex lines are
                always point-to-point SDLC links.

                _____________________________________________________

              o  Signaling convention

                 Does the line use NRZI signaling? (Y|N) [N]:

                 Specify the signaling convention to be used on the
                 line. Type YES if the line uses non-return-to-zero
                 inverted (NRZI) bit encoding; press <Ret> if not. This
                 setting must correspond with the NRZI parameter setting
                 for the IBM ACF/NCP LINE macro.

              o  Modem type

                 Is the modem an IBM diagnostic modem? (Y|N) [N]

                 Specify whether the modem is an IBM diagnostic modem.
                 If the line uses modems without diagnostics, press
                 <Ret>. The default, which is NO, specifies a modem that
                 does not have diagnostic capabilities.

                 This parameter controls how the Gateway device driver
                 interprets the Test Indicator (TI) modem lead (CCITT
                 142). IBM diagnostic modems use this lead to indicate
                 the modem is handling signals from a host Link Problem
                 Determination Aid (LPDA) test.

                ______________________ Caution ______________________

                If you are not using IBM diagnostic modems, be
                sure to answer NO to the prompt (that is, set the
                modem to NORMAL operations). Some modems provide a
                clocking signal on the TI lead. If the modem type
                is set to DIAGNOSTIC, any clocking signals on the

              TI lead will severely degrade the performance of the
              Gateway.

              _____________________________________________________

           o  MAXDATA size

              MAXDATA size (bytes) [265] :

              This value must match that specified for MAXDATA in the
              IBM ACF/NCP PU macro. Obtain this value from the IBM
              systems programmer. The value you specify for MAXDATA
              size sets the RECEIVE BUFFER size and the PU SEGMENT
              size. The default is 265.

     3.2.4.2 Circuits

           After prompting you for line parameters, the configuration
           procedure prompts for circuit information. The circuit
           controls the flow of data over the physical line. The IBM
           Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) line protocol is used
           over the lines from the Gateway to the IBM system.

           For each circuit you configure, you will see the following
           identifying banner and configuration question:

                        +--------------------------+
                        |     Circuit SDLC-n       |
                        +--------------------------+

           o  Response mode

              Extended response mode on circuit? (Y|N) [N] :

              Specify whether the circuit operates with NORMAL
              (modulo 8) or EXTENDED (modulo 128) frame numbering.
              Modulo 128 frame numbering is supported only on IBM
              ACF/NCP V4 or later. The setting must correspond with
              the MODULO parameter for the IBM ACF/NCP LINE macro.

           o  Circuit duplex

              Is the data transfer mode full duplex? (Y|N) [N] :

              The circuit duplex specification controls how the data
              is transferred. Specify whether the data transfer is
              to be two-way simultaneous (FULL) or two-way alternate
              (HALF). On a circuit in FULL duplex mode, frames can be
              sent and received at the same time. On a HALF duplex

     3-12 Configuring the Gateway-ST

 






                 mode circuit, each end must wait until the other end
                 has finished sending before it can send.

                 The circuit duplex must agree with the DATMODE
                 parameter in the IBM ACF/NCP GROUP or PU macro. If the
                 DATMODE parameter is specified as FULL, the circuit is
                 full duplex and if the DATMODE parameter is specified
                 as HALF, the circuit is half duplex.

                 The following combinations of circuit duplex and line
                 duplex are allowed:

                 o  A full-duplex line and a full-duplex circuit

                 o  A full-duplex line and a half-duplex circuit

                 o  A half-duplex line and a half-duplex circuit

                 Remember, for full-duplex data transfer, not only
                 the line but also the circuit must be operating in
                 full-duplex mode. If you set the circuit to FULL, the
                 corresponding line duplex parameter must also be set to
                 FULL. However, you can run a half-duplex circuit over a
                 full-duplex line if you wish.

              o  Station address

                 Station address (2 hex digits) [01] :

                 Specify the SDLC station address. Enter two hexadecimal
                 digits. The value must correspond with the ADDR
                 parameter setting for the IBM ACF/NCP PU macro. The
                 default address is 01.

              o  Station identifier

                 Station identifier (8 hex digits) [00000000] :

                 The SDLC station identifier (XID) is used on dial-up
                 (switched) lines to verify the identity of the station.
                 Specify the identifier as eight hexadecimal digits. The
                 first three digits must correspond with the setting of
                 the IDBLK parameter for IBM ACF/VTAM PU macro. The last
                 five digits must correspond with the setting of the
                 IDNUM parameter for the IBM ACF/VTAM PU macro.

     3.2.4.3 Physical Units

           The configuration procedure prompts for PU information for
           the circuit(s). Physical units (PUs) provide the physical
           services for the Gateway node.

           For each PU you configure, you will see the following
           identifying banner and configuration question:

                        +--------------------------+
                        |          PU SNA-n        |
                        +--------------------------+

           o  LU list

              Enter the list of available LU addresses (number or range) [1-255]:

              The LU list specifies the logical units (LUs) that
              are defined for the PU; the number of defined LUs
              is not equal to the number of concurrent sessions
              supported by the Gateway-ST (see the Gateway-ST Release
              Notes). Enter the LUs as a list of decimal number
              ranges separated by commas. For example, define LUs
              1 through 10, LU 12, and LUs 20 through 30 as follows:

              1-10,12,20-30

              A process on the SNA host node can use only those LUs
              defined in the list. Any request for communication with
              an LU not in the list is rejected. The LUs listed must
              correspond with the LU addresses defined in the LOCADDR
              parameter for the IBM ACF/VTAM LU macro.

     3.2.4.4 Access Names

           An access name is a name assigned by the Gateway manager
           to represent a list of parameters that define a session
           with the IBM system. Refer to the documentation for
           the individual DECnet SNA access routines for specific
           information on using access names.

           For each PU you configure, you will see the following
           identifying banner and configuration question:


     3-14 Configuring the Gateway-ST

 






                           +--------------------------+
                           |Access names for PU SNA-n |
                           +--------------------------+

              You will now be prompted for one or more access names.
              Press <RETURN> when you have no more to enter.

              Access name (1-16 chars)[]:

              Enter the access name as 1 to 16 alphanumeric characters;
              for example, CICS.

              If you type an access name, additional prompts appear.
              After you define all the information for a particular
              access name, the initial access name prompt appears again.
              If you enter a second access name, the process begins
              again, starting with the prompt for LU list.

              When you have finished defining access names, press <Ret>
              in response to the access name prompt. If there are more
              circuits to be configured,
              SNACST$CONFIGURE returns to the questions in Section 3.2.4.2.
              If there are no more circuits to be configured, SNACST$CONFIGURE
              proceeds to the server questions in Section 3.2.4.5.

              The prompts for access names are:

              o  LU list

                 LU list     (number or range)[]:

                 A list of LU addresses allocated to session requests
                 using the access name. Enter a list of numbers and/or
                 number ranges separated by commas. For example, the
                 following list specifies LUs 1 through 10, LU 15, and
                 LUs 20 through 30 for sessions using the access name
                 specified:

                 1-10,15,20-30

              o  IBM application name

                 IBM application name    (1-8 chars)[]:

                 The name of the IBM application for the access name.
                 Enter 1 through 8 alphanumeric characters. Sessions
                 established with this access name connect to the
                 designated IBM application. If you need to specify

              this parameter, ask the IBM systems programmer for the
              name.

           o  IBM logon mode name

              IBM logon mode name (1-8 chars)[]:

              Enter 1 through 8 alphanumeric characters to specify
              an IBM ACF/VTAM Logon Mode Table entry for use at the
              start of each session. The Logon Mode Table entry can
              specify the protocol rules for the session. If you
              specify no logon mode name, the default entry for the
              LU address as defined on the IBM system is used. The
              name should correspond with the operand label of an IBM
              ACF/VTAM MODEENT macro.

           o  IBM user data

              IBM user data (1-32 chars)[]:

              Enter 1 through 32 characters. This specifies an
              optional string of user data, which will be passed
              to the session partner. The format of the data is
              specific to the IBM application acting as the session
              partner. Check with the IBM systems programmer for the
              requirements of this field.

     3.2.4.5 Servers

           After you define all your lines and their associated PUs,
           LUs, and access names, the configuration procedure prompts
           you to define information about the DHCF server.

           All parameters for the SNA-ACCESS and RJE servers are
           automatically defined by the system. (After initial
           configuration, use SNANCP commands to modify any server
           information.) In addition, the configuration procedure
           defines all parameters for the DHCF server except for LU
           list information. The configuration procedure prompts you
           for this optional DHCF information. If you are not using a
           DHCF server, press <Ret> at the prompt.




     3-16 Configuring the Gateway-ST

 






              An identifying server banner and configuration questions
              appear:

                                  +-----------+
                                  |  Servers  |

              Server SNA-ACCESS
              No questions for this server.

              Server RJE
              No questions for this server.

              Server DHCF
              You will now be prompted for the list of LUs allocated to DHCF for each PU.
              Press <RETURN> if you do not wish to define any LU for a given PU.

              LU list allocated to DHCF for PU SNA-0 (number or range) []:

              Enter a list of LUs to be allocated to the DHCF server,
              for example, 20-30. If the number of LUs allocated exceeds
              the total number of DHCF sessions allowed, this command
              will be rejected.

        3.2.4.6 End of Part 2

              When you have answered all the questions for Part 2 of
              the configuration, the following informational messages
              appear:

                      All questions for this section have been answered.

                      The following SNANCP commands will be used to set the SNA database
                      in the Gateway each time it is loaded.

              The system then displays the SNANCP commands in the
              configuration file.

              The file that is displayed contains both information
              you specified for the SNA components and default system
              information.

              After displaying the command procedure, the system prompts
              you as follows:

              Do you wish to redo this section? (Y|N) [N]:

              If you type Y, this part of the configuration is run
              again, and you can provide different values at the
              prompts.

           If you press <Ret>, you see the following message:

                   The file you have created has been saved in:

                           SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]SNAGATEWAY_gateway-node-name_SNA.COM

                   You can edit this command file to change the configuration
                   of the SNA database in the Gateway. Any changes you make will
                   take effect the next time the Gateway is reloaded.

           This configuration file is used to initialize the
           Gateway-ST whenever it is loaded. The procedure continues
           with Part 3.

     3.2.5 Part 3: Information About the Gateway DECnet Database

           In Part 3 of the configuration procedure, you provide
           information for the DECnet database in the Gateway-ST.
           This information creates the following configuration file
           that contains NCP commands:

           SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]SNAGATEWAY_gateway-node-name_DNA.COM.

           This configuration file initializes the DECnet database
           components in the Gateway-ST each time the Gateway-ST
           is loaded. You can edit this file to customize your
           configuration.

           Each time the Gateway software is loaded, the Gateway node
           performs the following steps to initialize the database:

           o  Reads all the nodes defined in the DECnet database on
              the load host that are in its area (that is, nodes that
              have the same DECnet area number as the Gateway node).

           o  Defines all the nodes in the same DECnet area in the
              Gateway node's DECnet database.

           o  Requests that the load host execute the command
              procedure that you create in this section of the
              configuration procedure. This file specifies the
              privileged username and password for access control
              of the Gateway-ST.


     3-18 Configuring the Gateway-ST

 






              The DECnet database on the Gateway-ST is a combination of
              the default node database, which is created by the Gateway
              software, and the information you provide in Part 3 of the
              configuration procedure. You can customize the database
              that is created in this initial configuration by editing
              the DECnet database configuration file:

              SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]SNAGATEWAY_gateway-node-name_DNA.COM

              Use an editor to change the NCP commands in this file. For
              example, to define an additional node name for the node
              database, add a NCP SET NODE command.

              At the beginning of Part 3, the system prompts:

              Do you wish to create this command file? (Y|N) [Y]:

              If you type Y, you are prompted for the information in the
              following section.

        3.2.5.1 Privileged Username and Password

              The two following prompts ask for a privileged username
              and password:

              Privileged username?  (1-16 chars) []:
              Privileged password?  (1-16 chars) []:

              For each prompt, enter 1 through 16 alphanumeric
              characters.

              The privileged user name and password control access to
              the following Gateway functions:

              o  NCP CLEAR, LOOP, SET, and ZERO commands

              o  SNANCP CLEAR, LOOP, SET, SHOW LU (for authorization
                 information), and ZERO commands

              o  SNATRACE commands

        3.2.5.2 End of Part 3

              When you have answered all the questions for Part 3 of
              the configuration, the following informational messages
              appear:

                      All questions for this section have been answered.

                      The following NCP commands will be used to set the DECnet

     3.3 Sample DECnet/VAX Configuration

           This section contains a sample configuration in which
           one line, one circuit, one PU, and one access name are
           defined. Note that this is only a sample. The actual
           configuration procedure could be modified slightly in
           maintenance updates of this product.

           The file displayed in this sample contains both infor-
           mation you specified for the SNA components and default
           system information.

           If you are defining more than one component, the
           configuration procedure prompts you to specify the
           characteristics of each individual component.

                Configuration is divided into three parts:

                .       Part 1: Define the Gateway node in the load host's
                                DECnet database.

                .       Part 2: Create a command file that will be used to
                                configure the SNA database in the Gateway
                                each time it is loaded.

                .       Part 3: Create a command file that will be used to

                                each time it is loaded.

                This configuration procedure prompts you to see if you want
                to run each of the three parts.  All parts must be completed
                before the Gateway can be loaded. Enter "?" at any time for

                                         Loading the Gateway-ST Software



              This chapter describes how to down-line load the Gateway-
              ST software from the load host into the DEC MicroServer
              or DEC MicroServer-SP. You must complete the installation
              and configuration procedures described in the two previous
              chapters before you can load the Gateway-ST software.

              You load the Gateway-ST software in one of two ways:

              o  For the initial loading of the software, plug in the
                 DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-SP to power it up.
                 As part of its power-up sequence, the unit requests a
                 load of the software from the load host.

              o  For subsequent loading of the software, issue an NCP
                 TRIGGER or LOAD command on the load host.

              Loading should take about five minutes. The time varies
              according to the following:

              o  The type of CPU and disks on the load host

              o  The amount of other work the load host is processing

              o  The traffic on the local area network (LAN)

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The following commands and examples are based on
                the software loading of a DECnet/VAX system, and
                may be different from DECnet/OSI. See Section 4.5
                for a complete sample loading of the software on
                a DECnet/OSI system. Also, refer to the DECnet/OSI
                NCL Reference Manual for more information on NCL
                commands.

                                     Loading the Gateway-ST Software 4-1

 






     4.1 Before Loading the Gateway-ST

           Before attempting to load the Gateway-ST software, you
           should check the connection between the DEC MicroServer
           or DEC MicroServer-SP and the load host, and you should
           enable event logging.

     4.1.1 Checking the Load Host Connection

           Check the following items before trying to load the
           Gateway-ST software:

           o  The line associated with the Ethernet circuit over
              which the software will be loaded must be defined and
              set to ON (use the NCP SHOW LINE command).

           o  The circuit on the load host must be enabled for
              service (use the NCP SHOW CIRCUIT CHARACTERISTICS
              command).

           o  The service timer must be set to a large enough value
              to allow the software to load (use the NCP SHOW LINE
              CHARACTERISTICS command). The service timer sets the
              maximum time that will elapse during service for the
              Gateway before a retransmission is necessary. The
              default of 4,000 milliseconds should be enough (use
              the NCP SET LINE SERVICE TIMER to change this value).

           For more information on the DECnet NCP commands, refer to
           the OpenVMS Network Control Program Manual.

     4.1.2 Enabling Event Logging on the Load Host

           If you enable event logging at a terminal connected to
           the load host, you receive a log of the events that occur
           during loading. You can examine this log to verify that
           the Gateway-ST software loaded successfully. In case
           of a problem while loading the Gateway-ST software, you
           can examine the event log to determine the cause of the
           problem.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              To enable logging at a terminal connected to the
              load host, you need OPER privilege.

              _____________________________________________________

     4-2 Loading the Gateway-ST Software

 






              Issue the following DCL command from the terminal on which
              you want to receive the event log:

              $ REPLY/ENABLE=NETWORK

              You can ensure that SNA event logging is active by using
              the DCL SHOW SYSTEM command. There should be a process
              called SNAEVL. Use the following syntax:

              $ SHOW SYSTEM

        4.2 Loading the Software from the Hardware Unit

              To initiate the loading of the Gateway software, power up
              the hardware unit (either the DEC MicroServer or the DEC
              MicroServer-SP). If the unit is already powered up, press
              the DUMP button. This method of loading the Gateway-ST
              software produces a dump file.

        4.3 Loading the Software from a Terminal

              You can use variations of the NCP TRIGGER and LOAD
              commands to start loading the Gateway software. There
              are different procedures for the following cases:

              o  Your terminal is logged into the load host. (See
                 Section 4.3.1.)

              o  Your terminal is logged into a host other than the load
                 host. (See Section 4.3.2.)

              The TRIGGER command sets off a bootstrap mechanism in the
              DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-SP. This command causes
              the unit to send a request-to-load message to all hosts
              on the Ethernet local area network. Gateway load hosts
              are configured to receive the message. The first load host
              that responds to the request-to-load message loads the
              Gateway software into the Gateway node.

              The LOAD command loads software into the hardware unit by
              using the specified circuit or the circuit obtained from
              the DECnet database on the host from which the command is
              issued.

           If there are no errors during loading, the load host's
           console displays the following event messages; the exact
           messages and sequence might vary:

           If there are errors during loading, the load host's
           console displays (in place of the preceding messages)
           any errors detected during loading and Gateway-ST
           initialization. For a list of SNANCP error messages
           and how to recover from them, refer to the DECnet SNA
           Gateway-CT and ST Management (OpenVMS).

           If any errors occur when loading the configuration file,
           the errors are reported to the event log. The DECnet SNA
           Gateway-CT and ST Management (OpenVMS) lists and explains
           all initialization messages generated by the
           Gateway-ST software.

           If you issue an NCP TRIGGER command from any node on
           the Ethernet LAN and the Gateway node fails to start,
           you might try starting the load at the hardware unit
           (as described in Section 4.2). Refer to the DECnet SNA
           Gateway-ST Problem Solving if you need help finding the
           source of a failure.

     4.3.1 Loading from a Terminal Logged into the load host

           Issue the NCP TRIGGER NODE command using the following
           format:

           NCP>TRIGGER NODE node-id

           where

           node-id   Identifies the name of the Gateway node

           The following is an example of the NCP TRIGGER command:

           NCP>TRIGGER NODE SNAGWY

           NCP>TRIGGER VIA dev-c PHYSICAL ADDRESS nn-nn-nn-nn-nn-nn

           where

           dev-c         Is the Ethernet circuit id

           nn-nn-nn-nn-  Is the Gateway Ethernet address
           nn-nn

           Issue the NCP LOAD NODE command using the following
           format:

           NCP>LOAD NODE node-id

              where

              node-id   Identifies the name of the Gateway node.

              Issue the NCP LOAD VIA command using the following format:

              NCP>LOAD VIA dev-c PHYSICAL ADDRESS nn-nn-nn-nn-nn-nn

              where

              dev-c         Is the Ethernet circuit id

              nn-nn-nn-nn-  Is the Gateway Ethernet address
              nn-nn

              Use the NCP TELL command to obtain the Ethernet address of
              the Gateway:

              NCP>TELL gateway_node_name SHOW EXECUTOR STATUS

              When you issue a command, any information needed to load
              the software but not specified on the command line (such
              as the circuit to be used and the name of the files being
              loaded) is taken from the DECnet database of the load
              host.

        4.3.2 Loading from a Terminal Not Logged into the Load Host

              Use the NCP TELL command to indicate that the loading of
              the Gateway-ST software should take place from the load
              host.

              When using the NCP TRIGGER NODE command, enter the
              following command line:

              NCP>TELL node1-id USER user-id PASSWORD password TRIGGER NODE node2-id

              where

              node1-id  Is the load host

              node2-id  Is the Gateway node

              The following is an example of loading software when your
              terminal is not logged in to the load host. The load host
              name and Gateway name correspond with the names used in
              the configuration procedure.

              NCP>TELL CLOCK USER SYSTEM PASSWORD ALICE TRIGGER NODE SNAGWY

           password TRIGGER VIA BNA-n -
           - PHYSICAL ADDRESS nn-nn-nn-nn-nn-nn

           where

           node-id       Is the load host

           n             Is the Ethernet circuit id

           nn-nn-nn-nn-  Is the Gateway Ethernet address
           nn-nn

           When using the NCP LOAD NODE command, enter the following
           command line:

           NCP>TELL node1-id USER user-id PASSWORD password LOAD NODE node2-id

           where

           node1-id  Is the load host

           node2-id  Is the Gateway node

           When using the NCP LOAD VIA command, enter the following
           command line:

           NCP>TELL node-id USER user-id PASSWORD password LOAD VIA BNA-n -
           - PHYSICAL ADDRESS nn-nn-nn-nn-nn-nn

           where

        4.4 Checking the Gateway Node to Load Host Connection

              When you have successfully loaded the Gateway-ST software,
              you should check the connection between the Gateway node
              and the load host. When the Gateway node boots, verify
              that the link from the load host to DECnet is working
              properly, as follows:

              1. Verify that the load host can communicate with the
                 Gateway node, by issuing the NCP command SET EXECUTOR
                 NODE with the Gateway node ID. If you get an error
                 message after entering this command, refer to the
                 DECnet SNA Gateway-ST Problem Solving for help.

              2. Check the results of the NCP SET EXECUTOR NODE command
                 with the following command:

                 NCP>SHOW EXECUTOR STATUS

                 If you get an error message after this command, refer
                 to the Configuring the Gateway chapter in the manual
                 DECnet SNA Gateway-ST Problem Solving. Also, check the
                 event log for a message showing circuit activity with
                 the DECnet node since the Gateway-ST was booted.

              Refer to the OpenVMS Network Control Program Manual and
              the OpenVMS Networking Manual for further details on
              connections within a DECnet network.
