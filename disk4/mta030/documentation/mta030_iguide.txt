     Installation Prerequisites

           Before you install the MAILbus 400[TM] MTA:

           o  Ensure the following software is installed on your
              system:

              -  OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] Version 6.1, or later, or
                 OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0, or later.

              -  DECnet[TM]/OSI[R] for OpenVMS VAX, Version 6.3, or
                 later, or
                 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0, or later,
                 including the OSI Applications Kernel (OSAK[TM]).

           o  Ensure you have access to the SYSTEM account.

           o  Back up your system disk using the OpenVMS Backup
              Utility.

           o  Register a valid MTA license, MAILBUS-400-MTA or
              MAILBUS-400-USER, where you install the MAILbus 400 MTA
              Server component. Use the OpenVMS License Management
              Facility (LMF) to do this.

           o  Make sure the MAILbus 400 MTA, and any applications
              that use the MAILbus 400 MTA, are shut down before
              installing the new version of the MAILbus 400 MTA.

           o  You can modify the software on your VAX or MicroVAX[TM]
              system with the VMSTAILOR utility. Ensure you have
              not removed the Object and Shareable Image libraries
              software; this is required by the MAILbus 400 MTA.

           See the OpenVMS system management documentation for
           information about the OpenVMS Backup utility, VMSTAILOR,
           and the OpenVMS License Management Facility.

     Information Required

           To install the MAILbus 400 MTA, you need to know the name
           of the device from which the installation kit will be
           loaded.

        Time Required

              The time it takes to install the MAILbus 400 MTA
              depends on the resources available on your system.
              The installation takes approximately 15 minutes on a
              VAXstation[TM] 3500.

        Disk Space Required

              The following table shows the approximate amount of disk
              space required on the system disk (in blocks) during and
              after installation for the different components.

              Additional disk space is required after installation for a
              MAILbus 400 MTA to be able to handle message traffic.

        Installing the MAILbus 400 MTA

              From the SYSTEM account on the node or cluster where you
              want to install a MAILbus 400 MTA component, type:

              @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL MTA020 device OPTIONS N

              where device is the name of the device where the
              distribution medium is to be mounted, for example MUA0.

              The installation procedure starts and prompts you to
              select the components you want to install. To specify
              more than one of the components offered, enter the number
              associated with each component, with a comma between
              numbers.

              Installing Components for the MTA

              On each single node, or on one node in a cluster, where
              you want to have an MTA, select the options to install the
              following components: MAILbus 400 MTA Mgt, MAILbus 400 MTA
              Server, and MAILbus 400 MTA Base.

              Installing Component for Remote Management

                                                                       3

 






           Select the option to install the MAILbus 400 MTA Mgt
           component on each other single node, or on one node in
           each other cluster, where you want to remotely manage an
           MTA and the MTA's routing information in the directory.

           Installing Component for Remote Access by XAPI Agents

           Where an XAPI Agent (that is, and Agent using the X.400
           API) is to be installed on a system remote from the
           MTA, select the option to install the MAILbus 400 MTA
           Base component on the single node, or on one node in the
           cluster, where the Agent is to be installed.

     After the Installation

           The set-up tasks required after installation, and the
           MTA verification procedure are described in Part III of
           MAILbus 400 MTA Planning and Setup.

           Before you continue and set up each MAILbus 400 MTA, make
           sure that the Base component of the Digital[TM] X.500
           Directory Service is installed on each node or cluster
           where you intend to operate a MAILbus 400 MTA.

           Refer to the Digital X.500 Directory Service installation
           documentation for details of how to install the Digital
           X.500 Directory Service Base.

     Release Notes and Further Information

           After installation, the release notes are kept in
           SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP]MAILBUS400_MTA.RELEASE_NOTES.

           MAILbus 400 MTA Tuning and Problem Solving contains a list
           of the files that should be present on your system after
           installation, and information about how to contact Digital
           if the installation fails.
