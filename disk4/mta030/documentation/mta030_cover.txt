 Funtional Changes to the MAILbus 400 MTA

 The following changes have been made to the MTA for Version 3.0.
 Full details of these changes are provided in the MAILbus 400 MTA
 and API Release Notes for OpenVMS.

 o  MTA V3.0 includes a new feature called "Secured Distribution
    List" that prevents unauthorized users from sending mails to
    the secured distribution list.

 o  The new "Secured Deliver/Secured Transfer To Domain" feature
    prevents unauthorized users from sending mail to the secured
    recipients and secured domains.

 o  The MTA V3.0 also performs the "Maximum Content Length Check",
    while relaying messages to the peer MTAs. This check was previ-
    ously done only during delivery to recipients.

 o  The MTA V3.0 generates unique names for FTBP attachments, while
    upgrading bodyparts from BP15 to FTBP.

 o  The MTA code is now compiled with the Compaq DEC C compiler.

 o  The Non-DEC OID translation failure problem is resolved in the
    MTA Version 3.0.

 o  The MTA V3.0 does not crash while decoding certain types of
    IPMS extension field in messages.

 o  The MTA V3.0 resolves the NCL "set" command failure on an MTS
    replica.

 o  The MTA V3.0 supports 256 parallel agent connections.

 o  Now the MTA identifies a relocated DSA and continues working
    without requiring a restart.

 

 o  The MTA would, under certain conditions, not log the domain
    name for "Transfer In" entries in the accounting log. This
    problem has been resolved now.

 o  The MTA now successfully displays very large distribution lists
    in response to NCL queries.
