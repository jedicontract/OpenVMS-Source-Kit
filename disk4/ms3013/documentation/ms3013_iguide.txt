          Chapter__1______________________________________________________

          Introduction


          1.1 The MUXserver 300 Network

             The MUXserver 300 Remote Terminal Server Network connects
             remote terminals (or other asynchronous port devices) to an
             Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN).

             The network includes one MUXserver 300 or 310 Remote
             Terminal Server which is connected to an Ethernet Local
             Area Network (LAN). The MUXserver 300 and MUXserver 310 are
             separate products which support different numbers of remote
             asynchronous terminals or printers via synchronous links and
             remote terminal multiplexers. The MUXserver 300 connects up
             to 64 active devices and the MUXserver 310 connects up to 16
             active devices.

             Up to two synchronous links may be connected, via modems, to
             the MUXserver 300 and the MUXserver 310. Up to three remote
             terminal multiplexers (DECmux 300s) may be connected, via
             modems, in a daisy-chain fashion to each synchronous link.

             Depending on its particular model and configuration, each
             DECmux 300 may have 8, 16, 24 or 32 asynchronous ports.
             However, the total MUXserver 300 network is limited to 64
             active terminals at any one time and the total MUXserver 310
             network is limited to 16 active terminals at any one time.
             An active terminal is one that is using a LAT service or is
             currently at the Local> or Enter Username> prompt.

             The network connects each remote terminal to the LAN with
             access to LAT services.

          1.2 Software Installation Activities

          1.2.1 Overview

             The MUXserver 300 software includes the files in the
             MUXserver 300 Distribution Kit.

             Software installation involves:

             o  Installing the MUXserver 300 distribution software,

             o  Configuring the load host's node database,

             o  Verifying the load host installation by downline loading
                the server image, and

             o  Verifying the server system installation by testing a
                selection of representative server commands.

             Figure 1-1 is a flow chart of the software installation
             process. The steps in the flow chart serve as an overview
             of installing the distribution software and configuring the
             load host's node database.

             Software installation establishes a VMS system as a load
             host for one or more MUXserver 300 networks. A load host
             is a system that contains the server image and whose node
             database has entries for specific servers and, as a result,
             can downline load the server image to servers on the local
             Ethernet. In addition, a load host performs maintenance
             activities such as receiving upline dumps from the server.

             A load host can be a single VMS system or can be a member
             node of a VAXcluster. To act as a load host, a VMS system
             must be running DECnet Phase IV and must be located on the
             same Ethernet as the MUXserver 300(s).

             Digital Equipment Corporation suggests that:

             o  At least two load hosts be assigned for each MUXserver 300
                (or other server), and

             o  At least one load host be assigned for every ten servers.

          1-2  Introduction

 






             Providing alternate load hosts reduces the MUXserver 300
             network's dependence on one particular load host. If the
             primary load host is unavailable, another system can downline
             load the server and receive upline dumps from it. The
             MUXserver 300 should have these load-host functions available
             at all times. In addition, assigning more than one load host
             for every ten servers reduces the demand on any single load
             host's resources.

             Any Digital system that has a MUXserver 300 Distribution Kit
             available can be MUXserver 300 Software Distribution Kits are
             available for the following systems:

             o  VAX/VMS (installation is described in this guide), and

             o  ULTRIX (refer to the MUXserver 300 Software Installation
                Guide (ULTRIX)).

          1.2.2 Coordination with Hardware Installation

             MUXserver 300 software installation should be coordinated
             with the installation of the local and remote hardware.
             Chapter 4 describes the coordination required between
             hardware and software installation.

          1.2.3 Installing Distribution Software

             MUXserver 300 distribution software is installed onto a VMS
             system using an automated procedure called VMSINSTAL. The
             MUXserver 300 Software Distribution Kit includes a procedure
             file which is used by VMSINSTAL to perform the installation.
             When run, VMSINSTAL:

             o  Creates an appropriate directory on the load host for the
                software files,




                                                         Introduction  1-3

 






             o  Copies the files from the distribution media to the load
                host, and

             o  Optionally prints the MUXserver 300 release notes.

             Installation of distribution software is described in
             Chapter 2.

          1.2.4 Configuring the Load Host's Node Database

             When distribution software has been installed onto a VMS
             system (node), its database needs to be configured to support
             the new MUXserver 300 network.

             The databases are configured with an automated procedure,
             DSVCONFIG, which is included in the MUXserver 300 Software
             Distribution Kit.

             The host system's existing DSVCONFIG.COM file will be updated
             only if the version supplied with the software distribution
             kit is newer. If so, the old version of DSVCONFIG.COM file
             will be renamed to DSVCONFIG.COM_Vxx, where xx is the version
             number of the old file.

             Configuration of a load host's node database involves
             defining an entry for each server in three places:

             o  A data file called DSVCONFIG.DAT.

                The DSVCONFIG.DAT file is the MUXserver 300 network's
                configuration database. The file is automatically created
                by DSVCONFIG and is part of a load host's node database
                (see Figure 1-2).

             o  The DECnet operational (volatile) database.

             o  The DECnet permanent database.


          1-4  Introduction

 






             Configuration of a new server involves adding an entry to the
             load host's node database. The entry identifies the server's:

             o  Type,

             o  DECnet node name and DECnet node address,

             o  DECnet Circuit-ID,

             o  Ethernet address,

             o  Load file (server software image), and

             o  Dump file.

             Configuration may also involve modifying or deleting entries
             for existing servers. With DSVCONFIG the load host's node
             database can be configured to:

             o  Add a new unit,

             o  Swap an old unit with a new one,

             o  Remove a unit, or

             o  Restore the previous configuration from the local
                database.

             Refer to Chapter 3 for instructions on configuring the load
             host's node database to support servers.

             In addition to allowing you to configure a new server in
             the load host's node database, DSVCONFIG allows you to list
             all servers currently defined in the DSVCONFIG.DAT file
             and to restore to the host's DECnet databases all server
             configurations defined in DSVCONFIG.DAT.

             To configure a server on a VAXcluster:

             o  The distribution software is installed onto one member
                node, and then

             o  The databases are configured on the other nodes intended
                as load hosts.

                                                         Introduction  1-5

 






             When configuration is completed, the VMS Operating System
             will have been established as a load host for each server
             that has an entry in the node database. Refer to Chapter 3
             for information on configuring the load host's node database
             to support servers.

          1.2.5 Verifying the Installation

          1.2.5.1 Verifying the Load Host Installation

             Verifying a load host installation involves downline loading
             the server image to a server (using the NCP LOAD NODE
             command) and reading the DECnet event logging messages.
             Verifying a load host installation ensures that the host:

             o  Has the appropriate files in the correct directory,

             o  Has a correct entry in its node database for the test
                server, and

             o  Can successfully downline load the server image.

          1.2.5.2 Verifying the Server System Installation

             Verifying a complete server system installation involves
             the testing of a number of server commands at an interactive
             terminal connected to a server port. This ensures that:

             o  The correct version of the software is in the server,

             o  The server hardware operates with the new software, and

             o  The new software is running correctly.

          Installing Distribution Software


             This chapter describes the installation of the MUXserver
             300 distribution software onto a VMS load host using the VMS
             operating system's VMSINSTAL command.

             VMSINSTAL is an automated procedure that:

             o  Creates a directory called SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] on the
                load host,

             o  Copies the files from the distribution media into this
                directory, and

             o  Optionally prints a copy of the release notes.

             Installation will take about five minutes.

          2.1 Preparing to Run the Installation Procedure

             Before running the installation procedure:

             o  Determine which systems are to be load hosts for the
                server. The distribution software must be installed onto
                all load hosts.

             o  Check that each load host has 750 blocks of free disk
                space for downline loading the server image

             o  Check that DECnet Phase IV or Phase V is running and is
                in the ON state. For information on DECnet, refer to the
                DECnet-VAX Network Management Concepts and Procedures
                manual.

          2.2 Software Prerequisites

             Installation of MUXserver 300 distribution software requires:

             o  DECnet VAX, and

             o  VMS Operating System V5.0 or later.

          2.2.1 VMS Tailoring

             The MUXserver 300 software can be run on a tailored VMS
             system.

             Information on VMS Tailoring is contained in the System
             Support Addendum to the MUXserver 300 Software Product
             Description.

          2.3 VMSINSTAL Conventions

             VMSINSTAL is an interactive procedure. It displays a series
             of questions preceded by an asterisk (*). After a question
             the default response, if there is one, appears in brackets
             ([]).  At the end of the display line either a colon (:) or a
             question mark (?) appears.

             Type your response immediately after the colon or question
             mark and then press <Return>. To select the default response,
             press only <Return>.

             If you need assistance with a question, enter a question mark
             (?) and then press <Return> as a response. VMSINSTAL will
             display explanatory text about the question and then repeat
             the question.

             Refer to the VMS documentation for a complete description of
             VMSINSTAL.



          2-2  Installing Distribution Software

 






          2.4 Running VMSINSTAL

             1. Load the MUXserver 300 software distribution medium into
                the appropriate device.

             2. Log in to the system manager's account and enter the
                following commands:

                  $SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <Return>
                  $@VMSINSTAL MS3 device-identifier OPTIONS  N <Return>

                where device-identifier is the device in which the
                distribution medium is loaded.

                                             Note

                     Running the procedure with this command line is
                     the only way to get the release notes printed
                     automatically. If you run VMSINSTAL without
                     these keywords - device-identifier OPTIONS N
                     - the release notes will not be mentioned and
                     you will not be asked if you would like them
                     printed.

             3. VMSINSTAL then displays the procedure title, the data
                and time, and continues with the following (the warning
                message appears only if DECnet is running):

                       %VMSINSTAL-W-DECNET, Your DECnet network is up and running.
                       * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

                Press <Y> and then <Return> to answer YES and proceed with
                the installation.

             4. VMSINSTAL will display:

                       *Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                Press <Return> to answer YES, or take appropriate action.

             5. If you are installing from the distribution media (not
                from copied savesets), you are prompted to mount the first
                volume by:

                       Please mount the first volume of the set on device-identifier.
                       *Are you ready?

                Press <Y> and press <Return> . A message will confirm that
                the medium is mounted.

                Installation continues with:

                       The following products will be processed:
                          MS300 Vn.n
                       Beginning installation of MS300 Vn.n at hh:mm
                       %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

                                             Note

                     The MUXserver 300 software version numbers are
                     not specified in this Guide. For example, the
                     release note file is shown as MS3$nnn.RELEASE_
                     NOTES. Here, nnn represents the version number.
                     If version 1.3 is being installed, the release
                     notes file is MS3$013.RELEASE_NOTES.

             6. The procedure now lists the following options for printing
                and displaying the release notes.

                       Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

                       Additional Release Notes Options:
                         1.  Display release notes
                         2.  Print release notes
                         3.  Both 1 and 2
                         4.  None of the above

                       * Select option [2]

                Select one of these options. Digital recommends that you
                select Option 2 to print the release notes.

                If you select Option 1, the following message is
                displayed:

                        VMI$ROOT:[SYSUPD.MS3013] MS3$013.RELEASE_NOTES;1

                and the release notes will be immediately displayed on
                your terminal.

                If you select Option 2, you are asked to queue the file
                for printing:

                  * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                To print the release notes on the default printer press
                <Return> or, otherwise, specify another print queue. A
                message will indicate that the file has been queued.

                If you select Option 3, you are first asked to queue the
                file for printing:

                  * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                To print the release notes on the default printer press
                <Return> or, otherwise, specify another print queue. A
                message will indicate that the file has been queued. Next,
                the following message is displayed:

                       VMI$ROOT:[SYSUPD.MS3013] MS3$013.RELEASE_NOTES;1

                The release notes will immediately start scrolling on your
                terminal.

             7. After all release notes have been displayed (if appropri-
                ate), VMSINSTAL will continue with:

                       * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?

                o  Press <Return> to stop the procedure, and read the
                   release notes. Check for any changes that will affect
                   this installation. VMSINSTAL also places the release
                   notes in the file MS300$nnn.RELEASE_NOTES in the
                   SYS$HELP directory.

                   If you stop VMSINSTAL to read the release notes, run
                   the procedure again when you are ready to continue.
                   Enter:

                          $@VMSINSTAL MS3 device-identifier <Return>

                   where device-identifier is the device on which the
                   distribution medium is mounted.

                o  To continue with the installation, press <Y> then
                   <Return> .

             8. VMSINSTAL will then continue with:

                       %VMSINSTAL_I_RELMOVED , The product's release notes have been moved To
                       SYS$HELP

                       Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [Yes]?

                Press <Enter> to purge previous versions of the files.

                VMSINSTAL will then inquire:

                       Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [Yes]?

                Enter <Return> to allow the IVP to execute after the
                installation is complete.

                The following message will be displayed:

                  No more questions will be asked, the installation will take
                  one to two minutes.

             9. VMSINSTAL continues with the following message:

                  Your installation is now complete. After exiting from VMSINSTAL:

                  1. Edit your system start-up file so that it defines the logical
                     MOM$LOAD as a search string with a value equal to the current search
                     string, plus the added element SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]. For example:

                     DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/NAME_ATTRIBUTE=NO_ALIAS/NOLOG -
                     MOM$LOAD 'current-search-string',SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]

                     If the current search string associated with MOM$LOAD in your
                     start-up file is SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] or if you have
                     already made this change for a previous installation, there
                     is no need to edit this file.

                      loading.

                  2. Configure the server into  your  host's database.
                     Execute a command procedure  called  DSVCONFIG.COM. This
                     command  procedure is in the SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] directory.
                     If  you  have  already  executed  this  procedure from previous
                     installations, you need to configure only any additional units.
                     All previously defined units will still be configured.

             10.After editing the system startup file, run the config-
                uration procedure, DSVCONFIG.COM, to configure the load
                host's node database as described in Chapter 3.


          2.5 Installing onto Alternate Load Hosts

             Digital recommends that you establish alternate load hosts
             for each server.

             As with the original load host an alternate load host must be
             a DECnet Phase IV or Phase V system. To serve as an alternate
             load host, a system must also have the distribution software
             installed, and it must have entries for one or more servers
             in its node database.

             If the original load host is unavailable for downline loading
             the server image, any alternate load host can load the
             server instead. In addition, alternate load hosts can receive
             upline dumps from servers and can perform other maintenance
             functions.

          2.5.1 Installing onto Single Systems

             To install the server distribution software onto an alternate
             load host that is not a member of a VAXcluster, either:

             o  Load the distribution media into the appropriate device of
                the new load host and repeat the installation procedure
                detailed in Section 2.4, or

             o  Copy the distribution files from the original load host to
                a new load host.

          2.5.2 Installing onto VAXclusters

             To install the server distribution software onto an alternate
             load host that is a member of a VAXcluster, install the
             software onto one cluster member and:

             o  Log into a privileged (system) account on one of the other
                members of the cluster

             o  Enter the following command:

                    $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/NAME_ATTRIBUTE=NO_ALIAS/NOLOG MOM$LOAD-
                    current-search-string, SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] <Return>

             o  Include the above command in the node's system start-up
                procedure

          2.5.3 Installing onto Other Operating Systems

             To install the server distribution software onto another
             operating system follow the instructions in the MUXserver 300
             Software Installation Guide for that operating system.

          2.6 Installation Verification Procedure

             The MUXserver 300 Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
             can be executed at any time by entering the command:

                  @SYS$TEST:MS300$IVP

             If the MUXserver 300 software has been installed the IVP
             output will be:

          Chapter__3______________________________________________________

          Configuring the Load Host's Node Databases


             This chapter describes the procedures for configuring a load
             host's node database to support a specific MUXserver 300
             network.

             DSVCONFIG.COM is an automated, menu-driven procedure which
             is used to define servers in the load host's node database.
             DSVCONFIG allows entries for any server in the DECserver or
             MUXserver family (including MUXserver 300) to be defined,
             deleted, and modified.

             The installation procedure copies this procedure file to the
             SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] directory for both single systems and
             for VAXcluster member nodes (see Chapter 2).

                                          Note

                  DSVCONFIG.COM, supplied with the MUXserver 300
                  distribution kit, accommodates various terminal
                  servers, including:

                  o  DECserver 100, 200, 250, 300 and 500,

                  o  MUXserver 100, 300 and 310, and

                  o  MUXserver 320 and 380.

             DSVCONFIG allows:

             o  Listing servers that are currently defined in the load
                host's node database.

             o  Adding an entry for a new server in the load host's node
                database.

                Adding an entry supplies information that identifies the
                server on the Ethernet.

                           Configuring the Load Host's Node Databases  3-1

 






             o  Swapping an existing server for a new one or redefine an
                existing server's identification in the load host's node
                database.

                Swapping retains the DECnet node address of an existing
                server, replacing its Ethernet address with the Ethernet
                address of a new unit. This option also can replace other
                server identifiers either for a new server or for an
                existing one.

             o  Deleting an entry for an existing server from the load
                host's node database.

                Deleting an entry prevents the load host from recognizing
                the server. Thus, it is no longer a load host for that
                server. A database entry can be deleted when the network
                is reconfigured or a server is assigned to another load
                host.

             o  Restoring existing servers to a DECnet load database

                Restoring copies server entries from the load host's node
                database to the DECnet load database. Restoring is useful
                when a local DECnet database is routinely copied from a
                central DECnet database that does not include servers.

             Configuring a load host's node database involves adding,
             swapping and deleting entries in the DSVCONFIG.DAT file.
             Restoring reconfigures the DECnet load database.

             DSVCONFIG operates on the following three distinct databases:

             o  The load host's node database:

                This database is also the server database. It contains the
                information displayed when you select Option 1, List, from
                the DSVCONFIG menu.

             o  The permanent DECnet database.

             o  The volatile DECnet database.

          3-2  Configuring the Load Host's Node Databases

 






             When DSVCONFIG is run, data is sometimes transferred from
             the load host's node database to the DECnet databases. The
             DSVCONFIG procedure automatically keeps these databases
             synchronized.

                                          Note

                  DSVCONFIG includes several NCP commands. Do not
                  directly execute these commands to configure the
                  load host's node database because NCP affects only
                  the DECnet database.

             DSVCONFIG also prepares a node as a load host by enabling
             SERVICE on the service circuit. SERVICE must be enabled
             before a downline load can occur.

          3.1 Preparing to Run the Configuration Procedure

             Before starting the configuration procedure, check that:

             o  DECnet Phase IV or Phase V is running. For information
                on DECnet, refer to the DECnet VAX Network Management
                Concepts and Procedures Manual.

             o  There is a unique DECnet node name and node address for
                each server.

                To determine the node name and the node address and to
                determine that they are unique, ask your network manager
                or other person responsible for assigning node names and
                node addresses. Also, uniqueness can be determined with
                the NCP SHOW NODE command as follows:

                       $ NCP <Return>
                       NCP> SHOW NODE node_name CHARACTERISTICS <Return>

                or

                       NCP> SHOW NODE node_number CHARACTERISTICS <Return>

                           Configuring the Load Host's Node Databases  3-3

 






                The first line of the display for each node shows its
                number and name, for example:

                          Remote node=1.203 (MS380C)

             o  You know the Ethernet address of each server.

                This is the unique hardware address of each server. The
                Ethernet address is recorded on the Control/Indicator
                Panel of the MUXserver 300 and on the MUXserver 300
                Network Identification Card for that server that has been
                completed by the hardware installer.

             o  The directory SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER] exists, for
                VAXcluster nodes.

                If the directory does not exist, create it now.

             You will need the preceding information to answer prompts
             during DSVCONFIG.

          3.2 DSVCONFIG Conventions and Requirements

             DSVCONFIG is an interactive procedure which displays a menu
             of options. To select and activate an option, enter the
             corresponding number and then press <Return>.

             If you need assistance with a question, enter a question mark
             (?) and then press <Return> as a response. DSVCONFIG will
             display explanatory text about the question and then return
             to the DSVCONFIG menu.

             To exit DSVCONFIG at the menu level and return to the DCL
             prompt, enter <Ctrl/Z>. To exit an option and return to
             the DSVCONFIG menu, without making any changes, also enter
             <Ctrl/Z> .

             On completion of the Add, Delete, or Swap options NCP
             messages might display information, confirmation or errors.
             If an error is reported, the operation may have been
             unsuccessful. For a description of NCP messages, refer to

          3-4  Configuring the Load Host's Node Databases

 






             the VAX/VMS System Messages and Recovery Procedures Reference
             Manual.

             To run DSVCONFIG on a single system, the MUXserver 300
             distribution software must already have been installed on
             to that system. For a VAXcluster node, the distribution
             software can be installed on to any node of the cluster,
             not necessarily the node where DSVCONFIG is to be run.

             Refer to the VMS documentation for a full description of
             VMSINSTAL.

          3.3 Running DSVCONFIG

             1. Log into the system account, or any account with OPER and
                SYSPRV privileges.

             2. Enter the following commands:

                       $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] <Return>
                       $ @DSVCONFIG <Return>

                DSVCONFIG will:

                o  Determine if the DECnet key is installed. If DECnet is
                   missing, DSVCONFIG will print a message and then exit.

                   DECnet is required because DSVCONFIG executes DECnet
                   commands.

                o  Check the existence and format of a file called
                   DSVCONFIG.DAT, and:

                   *  If DSVCONFIG.DAT does not exist in SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER],
                      the procedure creates DSVCONFIG.DAT and displays a
                      message advising that the file was not found and a
                      new one was created.

                   *  DSVCONFIG.DAT will exist in SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]
                      if DSVCONFIG was previously used to add MUXserver
                      300 entries, and the procedure will continue with
                      its next task.

                           Configuring the Load Host's Node Databases  3-5

 






                   *  SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] or, for VAXclusters,
                      SYS$SPECIFIC:[DECSERVER] will already have
                      DSVCONFIG.DAT but in the incorrect format. The
                      procedure will re-format the file.

                      For VAXclusters, SYS$SPECIFIC:[DECSERVER] on each
                      VAXcluster node might have an older version of
                      DSVCONFIG.DAT. In this case, DSVCONFIG copies
                      the MUXserver 300 entries from that data file into
                      the DSVCONFIG.DAT file on SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER],
                      a directory shared by the VAXcluster nodes. The
                      procedure renames the DSVCONFIG.DAT file in
                      SYS$SPECIFIC so that the DSVCONFIG.DAT file in
                      SYS$COMMON is used thereafter.

                o  Print a message advising that each DECserver terminal
                   server must have a unique DECnet node name and DECnet
                   node address.

                o  Ask if you wish to continue or exit with:

                          Press <RET> to start or <CTRL/Z> to exit..

             3. Press <Return> to continue with the configuration.
                DSVCONFIG will display:

                       DECserver Configuration Procedure

          3.3.1 List Known Servers (Option 1)

             To list known servers in the load host's node database using
             Option 1:

             1. Press < 1 > and then <Return> . The contents of file
                DSVCONFIG.DAT will be displayed in seven columns. A
                typical listing will appear as:

                  DECnet   DECnet Server Service
                  Address  Name   Type   Circuit  Ethernet  Address  Load File      Dump File
                  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  28.1001  TUNA   DS200  UNA-0   08-00-2B-02-24-2B  PRO801ENG.SYS  DS2TUNA.DMP
                  28.1002  SHRIMP MS300  UNA-0   08-00-2B-04-AA-2B  MS4801ENG.SYS  MS3SHRIMP.DMP
                  28.1003  CONCH  DS100  UNA-0   08-00-2B-02-24-F1  PS0801ENG.SYS  PSDMP24F1.SYS
                  28.1005  OYSTER MS300  UNA-1   08-00-2B-04-AA-55  MS4801ENG.SYS  MS3OYSTER.DMP

                  Total of 4 DECservers defined.

             2. This information comprises the load host's node database
                which the load host uses for downline loading and for
                receiving upline dumps.

                When a server upline dumps its memory, which it does upon
                unexpected failure or upon request by the server manager,
                the data is dumped into the server dump file. This file
                can then be used for diagnostics.

                If a fatal bug check generates an upline dump, you should
                copy the dump file to magnetic tape and send it with a
                Software Performance Report (SPR) to Digital (the server
                manager may also ask you for a copy of the dump file).

                Each server has a unique dump file name. The name of a
                MUXserver 300 has the format:

                      MS3xxxxxx.DMP

                where xxxxxx is the DECnet node name of the server. For
                example, a MUXserver 300 with the DECnet node name SHRIMP

          3.3.2 Add a MUXserver 300 (Option 2)

             To add a MUXserver 300 using Option 2:

             1. Before adding a new MUXserver 300, ensure that you have
                the following information:

                o  The server type

                o  A unique DECnet node name for the MUXserver 300

                o  A unique DECnet node address for the MUXserver 300

                o  The Ethernet address of the MUXserver 300

                o  The service circuit_ID

             2. Press < 2 > and then <Return> to create a new entry in the
                load host's node database for a new server.

             3. DSVCONFIG will prompt for the server type with:

                       DECserver type?

                Specify the type of server you are adding:

                o  MS300 to add a MUXserver 300 or MUXserver 310

             4. DSVCONFIG will prompt for the server's DECnet node name
                with:

                       DECnet node name for unit?

                Specify the DECnet node name for the server. The node
                name must begin with a letter and contain from 1 to 6
                alphanumeric characters, and must be unique to the entire
                DECnet network.

             5. DSVCONFIG will prompt for the server's DECnet address
                with:

                       DECnet address for unit?

                Specify the DECnet node address for the server. This
                number must be a decimal number from 2 to 1023 which is
                unique within the network.

          3-8  Configuring the Load Host's Node Databases

 






                The DECnet network may be divided into areas. If this is
                the case, find out from your network manager your area
                number, because this number becomes part of each node
                address.

                With defined areas each node address takes the form
                aa.nnnn, where aa is a decimal number from 1 to 63, the
                period distinguishes area from node address and nnnn is
                the node address (for example, 7.103). If you omit the
                area, the area of the current load host is used as a
                default.

             6. DSVCONFIG will now prompt for the server's Ethernet
                address name with:

                       DECserver Ethernet address of this unit?

                Specify the Ethernet address of the server. This address
                is listed on the Control/Indicator Panel of the unit and
                on the MUXserver 300 Network Identification Card which was
                completed by the hardware installer. Enter the Ethernet
                address as six pairs of hexadecimal digits with hyphens
                (-) separating the pairs (for example, 08-00-01-00-AB-CB
                is a valid format).

             7. Finally, DSVCONFIG will prompt for the DECnet Service
                Circuit-ID with:

                       DECnet Service Circuit-ID [default-id]?

                Specify the service circuit_ID of your Ethernet controller
                type.

                Whenever you run this procedure, you may be asked to
                specify the service circuit_ID several times. The first
                time you are asked the default will be the service
                circuit_ID for the processor type of your VMS load host.
                If you respond by specifying a different service circuit_
                ID, that response becomes the new default.

                After you specify the service circuit_ID and press
                <Return> , DSVCONFIG adds the entry for the new server
                to the database and sets SERVICE ENABLED on the circuit
                supporting the Ethernet controller, both of which are
                necessary in order for the load host to downline load the
                server image to the server.

                                          Note

                  If you receive an error from DECnet while you
                  are adding a server, the entry is added to the
                  DSVCONFIG.DAT file (the load host's node database)
                  even though it is not entered in the DECnet load
                  database. You should immediately use Option 4 to
                  delete the entry, fix the condition causing the
                  DECnet error, then return to Option 2 to add the
                  server again.

                  If you specify a node address that is already
                  defined in the server database (the load host's
                  node database), you get a DSVCONFIG error, nothing
                  is added and the Add option is terminated.

          3.3.3 Swap an Existing Server (Option 3)

             Swapping retains the DECnet node address of the original
             unit. It is useful if an existing unit malfunctions and you
             need to replace it. It is also helpful for renaming servers.

             DSVCONFIG allows the following characteristics for the new
             unit to be specified:

             _____________________________________________________________
             Characteristic__Default______________________________________

             DECserver type  The type of the old DECserver you are
                             replacing.

             DECnet node     The name of the old DECserver you are
             name            replacing.

             Ethernet        There is no default. You must specify the
             address         Ethernet address of the new unit.

             DECnet service  The service circuit.
             circuit______________________________________________________

             To Swap an existing MUXserver 300 using Option 3:

             1. Press < 3 > and then <Return>

             2. DSVCONFIG will prompt for the node name with:

                       What is the DECnet node name you want to swap?

                Specify the node name of the existing MUXserver 300 to be
                replaced.

             3. DSVCONFIG responds by displaying the Ethernet address of
                the old unit and displaying:

                       DECserver at Ethernet Address nn-nn-nn-nn-nn-nn is being swapped.
                       Enter the new Ethernet address and any other changed characteristics.

                       DECserver type [default-type]?

                Press <Return> if you are replacing a MUXserver 300 with a
                MUXserver 300.

                If you are changing server types, specify the type of the
                new unit and press <Return>. A valid response is:

                o  MS300 for a new MUXserver 300 or MUXserver 310

             4. DSVCONFIG will then prompt for a DECnet node name with:

                       DECnet node name for unit [default-name]?

                Press <Return> if you want the replacement MUXserver 300
                to have the same DECnet node name as the old unit.

                If you are changing node names, specify the node name of
                the new unit and press <Return>. A MUXserver 300's DECnet
                node name must begin with a letter and contain from 1 to 6
                alphanumeric characters; the name must be unique to your
                entire DECnet network.

             5. DSVCONFIG will then prompt for an Ethernet address for the
                server with:

                  DECserver Ethernet address of this unit?

                Specify the Ethernet address of the new MUXserver 300.
                This address is shown on the Control/Indicator Panel of
                the unit and on the MUXserver 300 Network Identification
                Card for that unit which has been completed by the
                hardware installer. Enter the Ethernet address as six
                pairs of hexadecimal digits, with hyphens (-) separating
                the pairs (for example, 08-00-01-00-AB-CD is a valid
                format). Press <Return>.

             6. Finally DSVCONFIG will prompt for a DECnet Service
                Circuit_ID with:

                  DECnet Service Circuit_ID [default_id]?

                Press <Return> if the replacement MUXserver 300 has the
                same service circuit_ID as the old unit. If the service
                circuits are different, specify the service circuit_ID of
                the new unit and press <Return>.

                DSVCONFIG will then swap the new characteristics specified
                with the old ones for the server entry with the same
                DECnet node address (this address cannot be swapped).

          3.3.4 Delete an Existing MUXserver 300 (Option 4)

             Deleting is useful if you are reconfiguring the network or
             changing load hosts for a server.

             To Delete an existing MUXserver 300 from the database using
             Option 4:

             1. Press < 4 > and then <Return>

             2. DSVCONFIG will prompt for the DECnet node name with:

                        DECnet node name is to be deleted? (CTRL/Z to return to menu)

                Specify the DECnet node name of the DECserver to be
                removed and press <Return> .

             3. DSVCONFIG will check that the name you specified is an
                entry in the load host's node database and, if so, deletes
                the entry and reports successful removal.

          3.3.5 Restore Existing MUXserver 300s (Option 5)

             If your DECnet network contains a large number of nodes you
             may store your DECnet database on a central, remote node and
             copy this database upon each system startup. However, if many
             servers exist on the network, Digital advises that you not
             define these servers in that central DECnet database.

             If servers are not defined in the central database you must
             also reconfigure them whenever you copy your local DECnet
             database from this central DECnet database. Each time you

                          Configuring the Load Host's Node Databases  3-13

 






             copy the central DECnet database, use Option 5 to restore
             existing server configurations.

             The Restore option restores a load host's DECnet database to
             include the servers in its node database. It affects both the
             volatile and permanent DECnet databases.

             To restore an existing MUXserver 300 network using Option 5,
             press < 5 > and then <Return>.

             DSVCONFIG will confirm the restoration with:

                    Restoring existing DECservers from local database...
                    Local database successfully restored.

          3.3.6 Restoring from a Command Procedure

             As an alternative to using menu Option 5, a local DECnet
             database may be restored using DSVCONFIG.COM's RESTORE
             parameter. Using the RESTORE parameter bypasses the menu
             and allows configuration procedure to be included in the
             system start-up procedures. To use the RESTORE parameter, use
             the command:

                    $@DSVCONFIG RESTORE <Return>

             To cause a local DECnet database to be restored automatically
             during system startup, edit the system start-up file to
             include the following statement after the line containing
             @SYS$MANAGER:RTLOAD:

                    @SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]DSVCONFIG RESTORE

          3.4 Downline Loading the Server Image

             When configuration has been completed, verify the Load Host
             Installation by downline loading the new server image from
             the load host to the server using the procedure described in
             Chapter 4.

          Chapter__4______________________________________________________

          Verifying the Installation


             This chapter describes the verification of a MUXserver 300
             software installation. Verification includes:

             o  Verifying the load host installation by downline loading
                the server image.

             o  Verifying the MUXserver 300 as a system after it is
                loaded, by testing a number of representative server
                commands at an interactive terminal, which must be
                connected to the MUXserver 300.

             Verifying the load host installation involves downline
             loading the server image to a MUXserver 300 and then reading
             the DECnet event logging messages. This confirms that the new
             load host:

             o  Has the appropriate files in the correct directory,

             o  Has a correct entry in its node database for the server,
                and

             o  Can successfully downline load the server image to the
                MUXserver 300.

             Verifying the total MUXserver 300 system installation (the
             hardware unit with the correct software loaded and running)
             involves the testing of a number of representative server
             commands at an interactive terminal connected to a supervisor
             port. This confirms that:

             o  The correct version of the software has been loaded,

             o  The MUXserver 300 hardware operates with the new software,
                and

             o  The new software is running successfully.






































          4-2  Verifying the Installation

 






          4.1 Verifying the Load Host Installation

          4.1.1 The NCP LOAD NODE Command

             The NCP LOAD NODE command is the preferred method of downline
             loading a server image for verification purposes as it is
             the only method that tests the software installation from
             a specific load host. Other methods of downline loading are
             described in the MUXserver 300 Network Reference Manual.

             The LOAD NODE command allows:

             o  A load host to be specified

                This ensures that the load host which performs the
                downline load is your VMS system.

             o  DECnet event logging messages to be read.

                These messages confirm that the specified load host
                performed the downline load successfully.

             Depending on network or system requirements, a new server
             image may be downline load to a new MUXserver 300 or to an
             existing unit that is currently operating on the network.

          4.1.2 Loading a New MUXserver 300

             When a MUXserver 300 is new it has no operating software
             in it until the initial downline load, which occurs
             automatically upon MUXserver 300 local unit startup.

             When the hardware installer powers up a unit, the MUXserver
             300 automatically requests a load of its image from any
             available load host. An established load host recognizes
             the request and downline loads the server image.

             The hardware installer can then verify the hardware
             installation with the diagnostic light emitting diodes on
             the MUXserver 300 hardware unit(s). However, if the server
             image cannot be properly downline loaded as soon as the
             MUXserver 300 is powered up, the hardware installer sees

                                           Verifying the Installation  4-3

 






             server errors. Therefore, coordination between software and
             hardware installation is important.

             Note that this automatic downline load verifies the hardware
             but does not verify the load host installation.

          4.1.3 Loading an Existing MUXserver 300

             When an operating MUXserver 300 is loaded, all sessions with
             service nodes are disconnected. If an existing is about to
             be loaded with a new image, coordination with the server
             manager is important. Depending on users' requirements, it
             may be best to delay installation verification and to perform
             downline load during off hours.

             Ask the server manager of an existing MUXserver 300 to alert
             the interactive users on the server of the planned shutdown
             for reloading. The server manager should be given at least
             30 minutes' notice to disable connections and queuing to
             local services of the server if necessary. The MUXserver 300
             Network Reference Manual describes the issues involved in
             shutting down the server.

          4.1.4 Preparing for the LOAD Command

             To prepare for downline loading:

             1. Check the DECnet node name or DECnet node address of the
                MUXserver 300. To execute the LOAD command you need to
                know one of these node identifiers.

                If you do not remember this information from running
                the DSVCONFIG procedure (refer to Chapter 2), run the
                procedure again, and select the LIST option from the menu.
                LIST displays the DECnet node name and DECnet node address
                of all the servers you defined in this load host's node
                database.


          4-4  Verifying the Installation

 






             2. Determine the MUXserver 300's DECnet service password,
                if there is one, from the server manager (the manager may
                know it as the maintenance password). For a previously
                configured server you may need to specify this password on
                the LOAD NODE command line.

             3. Enable DECnet event logging. Event logging messages are
                generated by the Network Control Program (NCP). Enter the
                following commands:

                       $ NCP <Return>
                       NCP> SET LOGGING CONSOLE EVENT 0.3,7 <Return>
                       NCP> SET LOGGING CONSOLE STATE ON <Return>
                       NCP> SET LOGGING MONITOR STATE ON <Return>

                                          Note

                  All other commands needed for downline loading,
                  such as those that set the Ethernet line and
                  identify and enable the service circuit, are part
                  of DSVCONFIG and are executed when you run that
                  procedure (see Chapter 3).

          4.1.5 Warning Users before Loading

             To reload an installed and running MUXserver 300 during
             normal working hours, either you (if you know the password)
             or the server manager can use the server interface to issue
             the privileged BROADCAST ALL command to warn server users.

             A warning can also be broadcast from a remote console port.
             Appendix B describes the use of the Remote Console Facility
             on a VMS System.

             Issue the BROADCAST ALL command at the server prompt (Local>)
             to send a message to all ports on the MUXserver 300 network.
             A message can contain up to 115 characters.

             Note that the reception of broadcasts can be disabled on
             ports and some users may not receive a message.

                                           Verifying the Installation  4-5

 






             A typical BROADCAST ALL command is:

                    Local> SET PRIV <Return>
                    Password> system <Return> not echoed
                    Local> ATTACH ALL <Return>
                    Local> BROADCAST ALL "The server will be reloaded in 3 minutes." <Return>

          4.1.6 Issuing the LOAD Command

             After warning interactive users of an operating MUXserver 300
             network and after enabling event logging, issue the LOAD NODE
             command at a terminal connected to your VMS load host. On the
             command line enter either the DECnet node name or the DECnet
             node number.

             The following example command loads an existing MUXserver 300
             named SHRIMP with a node address of 13.204.

                    $ NCP <Return>
                    NCP> LOAD NODE SHRIMP <Return>

             or

                    NCP> LOAD NODE 13.204 <Return>

             If the server manager previously set a server maintenance
             password, include the SERVICE PASSWORD keywords and specify
             this password as the DECnet service password on the command
             line. For example:

                    NCP> LOAD NODE SHRIMP SERVICE PASSWORD OF23 <Return>

             To exit from NCP, type EXIT:

                    NCP> EXIT <Return>
                    $

          4.1.7 Checking DECnet Event Logging

             After executing the LOAD command check the DECnet event
             logging messages that report the load to confirm that it was
             successful. Read the event logging messages at your system's
             operator's console. They identify your VMS system as the node
             that generated the event.

             If no errors are reported you should assume that the downline
             load was successful and that verification of the new load
             host has been completed.

             Appendix C contains an example of DECnet event logging after
             a successful downline load.

             If the event logging messages report errors, contact the
             MUXserver 300 hardware installer and check that the hardware
             is working correctly. If it is, the problem is probably with
             the load host. Check:

             o  The node database, especially the Ethernet address you
                entered when you defined the test server,

             o  That the server image is in the appropriate directory, and

             o  That DECnet is running.

             Try entering the LOAD command again.

                                          Note

                  When event logging is set up on a DECnet node, you
                  can specify the destination (called the sink) of
                  the messages. You should set up one DECnet sink
                  node to receive all the logging events associated
                  with downline loading so that all load request
                  status information is available at one node.

          4.1.8 Loading After Hours

             Downline load can be performed after hours to minimize
             disruption to the nodes affected by the MUXserver 300. To
             do this, include the LOAD command in a batch job to be run
             after hours.

          4.2 Verifying the MUXserver 300 System Installation

             Complete the verification of the MUXserver 300 system
             installation using a number of representative server commands
             at an interactive terminal attached to the MUXserver 300's
             console port, as follows:

             1. Press <Return> a number of times

                The following message and prompt appear:

                       MUXserver 300 Terminal Server V1.3 (BL34) - LAT V5.2

                       Please type HELP if you need assistance

                       Enter username>

             2. Read the identification message and check that the correct
                version of the MUXserver 300 image was downline loaded. If
                the message is not displayed, the problem could be:

                o  With the load host,

                o  With the terminal, or

                o  That the incorrect software was downline loaded.

             3. Enter your user name (any string of 1 through 16
                characters that identifies you) and press <Return> . The
                port should now enter local mode, and the (Local>) prompt
                should appear:

                       Enter username> SWINSTALLER <Return>
                       Local>

          4-8  Verifying the Installation

 






             4. Use the TEST PORT command to check that the terminal
                is receiving valid character data. On the command line,
                specify the number of lines and the number of columns you
                would like displayed. For example, the following command
                will display five lines of 80 characters each:

                       Local> TEST PORT COUNT 5 WIDTH 80 <Return>

                You can interrupt this test by pressing any key.

                Appendix C contains an example of a TEST PORT display.

             5. Issue the SHOW PORT command to display the characteristics
                of your port and their values:

                       Local>SHOW PORT <Return>

                A port characteristics display, similar to the example
                shown in Appendix C, should appear.

             6. Use the SHOW SERVICES command to show what services are
                available to you. The following server command produces a
                list of services and service announcements:

                       Local>SHOW SERVICES <Return>

                Appendix C shows an example of a SHOW SERVICES display.

             7. Select an available service that you are authorized to use
                and use the CONNECT command to verify that the MUXserver
                300 can logically connect your terminal to that service.

                On the command line, specify the service name to which
                you wish to connect. The following example connects your
                terminal to a VMS system, named VSYSTEM:

                       Local> CONNECT VSYSTEM <Return>

                When the MUXserver 300 successfully connects your terminal
                to the specified service, you should no longer see
                the local prompt; you should be communicating with the
                service, in this example, your own VMS system.

                                           Verifying the Installation  4-9

 






             8. Enter several commands to verify the ability of the
                MUXserver 300 to exchange data with the service. For
                example, in this case, you could login then enter SHOW
                TIME and SHOW USERS.

             9. Press <BREAK> or log out from the service to return to
                local mode.

             10.Log out from the MUXserver 300 then log out the terminal
                from the unit:

                       Local> LOGOUT <Return>

             Refer any difficulties with MUXserver 300 system verification
             to the relevant server manager.

             If verification has been completed successfully, the test
             server is operating correctly and you should report the
             successful load host installation and MUXserver 300 system
             installation to the server manager.

             If this installation was a software upgrade, either you or
             the server manager must now reload all existing servers.

          Appendix__B_____________________________________________________

          Using the Remote Console Facility


             The MUXserver 300 network supports the VMS Remote Console
             Facility (RCF). This Appendix describes its use from a VMS
             host. RCF could be used to issue the BROADCAST command to
             warn users of a planned downline load.

             To connect to the MUXserver 300 network with RCF, use the
             CONNECT NODE command.

             1. On the command line, specify either the DECnet node name
                or DECnet node address of the MUXserver 300 as shown in
                the following two examples. The first example shows a
                connection to a MUXserver 300 named SHRIMP.

                       $NCP <Return>
                       NCP> CONNECT NODE SHRIMP <Return>
                       Console connected (press CTRL/D when finished)

                or

                       NCP>CONNECT NODE 28.1002 <Return>
                       Console connected (press CTRL/D when finished)

             2. Press <Return> to start the login sequence for the remote
                console.

                Login password protection is enabled for the MUXserver 300
                remote console port.

             3. Enter the login password when the MUXserver 300 prompts
                with "#".

                An audible beep accompanies the prompt. The prompt
                indicates that a link to the MUXserver 300 has been
                established.

                After the correct login password has been entered,
                MUXserver 300 commands can be used.

             The CONNECT command can be used with the MUXserver 300
             network's Ethernet address. The following example shows a
             connection from a VMS system with the service circuit-ID
             UNA-0 to a MUXserver 300 with the Ethernet address 08-00-2B-
             04-AA-2B:

                    NCP>CONNECT VIA UNA-0 PHYSICAL ADD 08-00-2B-04-AA-2B <Return>

             The service password might have to be specified with the
             CONNECT command if a maintenance password is specified on
             the MUXserver 300. To do so, include the SERVICE PASSWORD
             keywords on the command line and specify the password, for
             example:

                    $ NCP <Return>
                    NCP> CONNECT NODE SHRIMP SERVICE PASSWORD OF23 <Return>
                    Console Connected (press Ctrl/D when finished)

             To exit from RCF, type <Ctrl/D>

                    Local> <Ctrl/D>

             To exit from NCP, type EXIT:

                    NCP>EXIT <Return>
                    $

             If you log out from a MUXserver 300 with a LOGOUT command,
             the port is logged out but the remote console session remains
             active. Type <Ctrl/D> to exit the remote console session. The
             service node prompt appears, and control returns to NCP on
             the VMS system.

             For detailed information on RCF, refer to the MUXserver 300
             Network Reference Manual.

          Installation, Configuration & Verification Examples


             This Appendix provides examples of MUXserver 300 software in-
             stallation and configuration procedures. It also illustrates
             the verification of a load host installation by downline
             loading and reading DECnet event logging messages. Finally,
             it shows the verification of a MUXserver 300 installation by
             testing representative server commands.

          C.1 Installation Example

             The following example illustrates a successful installation
             onto a VMS V5.4 system. In this example, server software
             version numbers are not supplied. This example assumes a
             type of distribution media that requires only one medium, for
             example, a magnetic tape. For types such as TU58 cartridges,
             which require more than one volume, extra prompts during the
             procedure instruct you to mount additional volumes.

             This example also shows the suggested procedure to cause the
             release notes to be moved automatically to SYS$HELP.

                    Your installation is now complete. After exiting from VMSINSTAL:

                    1. Edit your system start-up file so that it defines the logical
                       MOM$LOAD as a search string with a value equal to the current search
                       string, plus the added element SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]. For example:

                       DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/NAME_ATTRIBUTE=NO_ALIAS/NOLOG -
                       MOM$LOAD 'current-search-string',SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]

                       If the current search string associated with MOM$LOAD in your
                       start-up file is SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] or if you have
                       already made this change for a previous installation, there
                       is no need to edit this file.

                       This command ensures that the location of the server image
                       is defined each time the system is rebooted, necessary for
                       successful downline loading.

                    2. Configure the server into your host's database.
                       Execute a command procedure called DSVCONFIG.COM.
                       This command procedure is in the SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] directory.
                       If you have already executed this procedure from previous
                       installations, you need to configure only any additional units.
                       All previously defined units will still be configured.

          C.2 Configuration Examples

                                          Note

                  DSVCONFIG.COM is a command procedure used with
                  all Digital terminal servers. All references
                  to DECservers include the MUXserver 300 and the
                  MUXserver 300.

          C.2.1 Starting DSVCONFIG.COM

             The following example shows the beginning of the configura-
             tion procedure. This example assumes that the latest version
             of DSVCONFIG has already been run so that the DSVCONFIG.DAT
             file exists in the correct format. (Refer to Chapter 3 for
             the prompts that are displayed if the procedure has either to
             create DSVCONFIG.DAT or be reformatted.)

                    $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] <Return>
                    $ @DSVCONFIG <Return>

                    You must assign a unique DECnet node name and DECnet node address for each
                    DECserver.

                    Press RETURN to start, or CTRL/Z to exit... <Return>

                    If you get an error message now, the new unit won't be added, and you
                    should delete it from the directory.

             Use the List option to display a listing of servers and check
             that SHRIMP appears on the listing of entries.

          C.2.5 Swapping a MUXserver 300 for a New Unit (Option 3)

             In the following example an existing MUXserver 300 named
             CONCH is swapped for a new MUXserver 300, which is given the
             same DECnet node name. The DECnet node address always stays
             the same with Swap. The new server also has the same service
             circuit-ID as the old server. Note that if you use Swap a
             MUXserver 300, you will have to specify the new MUXserver
             300's Ethernet address.

          C.3.1 Verifying a Load Host Installation

             The following example shows the installation verification
             for a VMS load host. This procedure tests that your VMS
             system can perform successfully as a downline load host for a
             particular server.

             In this example the VMS system is named VSYSTEM. The server
             that is loaded is a MUXserver 300 with DECnet node name
             SHRIMP. SHRIMP is an existing server, currently operating
             on the network. This example assumes that the downline load
