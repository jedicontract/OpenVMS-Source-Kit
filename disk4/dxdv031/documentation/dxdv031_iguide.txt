                     Installing on an OpenVMS VAX System

                     Order Number: AV-PUCHG-TE


                     Revision/Update Information: Version 3.1

                     Checklist:

                     1. Read the Read Before Installing document.

                     2. Check prerequisite software, diskspace, and
                        licenses.

                     3. Install V3.1 of the Directory Service.

                        Print the release notes and run the IVP during
                        the installation.

                     4. Edit SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM to submit the directory
                        startup procedure during system startup.

                     5. If upgrading or reinstalling, recustomize any
                        customized files, specifically:

                        The schema files (recompile the schema if you
                        customize it)
                        DXD$DSA_STARTUP.NCL
                        DXD$TEMPLATE_STARTUP.NCL

                        Other files that might have been customized in a
                        previous version are saved during installation.
                        See Saving Files on Reinstallation.

                     6. Start the Directory Service.

     Prerequisite Software

           o  OpenVMS[TM] for VAX[TM] V6.1, or later

           o  DECnet[TM]/OSI[R] V6.2 for OpenVMS VAX or later,
              including the applications option

     Information Required

           Before installing, make sure you have the following
           information:

           o  The name of the device where the installation media
              will be loaded.

           o  The UIC to be assigned to the DXD$SERVER account.

           o  The name of the disk where the DXD$SERVER directory is
              to be created.

           o  For clusters, the server node name. See Installing on
              Clusters.

     Disk Space, Resource, and Time Requirements

           You need 40000 free blocks on the system device or
           Alternate Working Device that you use for the instal-
           lation. After installation, the components require disk
           space permanently on the system disk. Some components
           need global pages and sections. These requirements are
           cumulative.

           Before installing, ensure that the system resources allow
           for all of the components you install, remembering that
           the Base component is mandatory.

              You are recommended to back up your system disk before
              you begin the installation. Installation of all components
              takes approximately 15 minutes.

        Product Licenses

              Before installation, register one or more of the following
              licenses: X500-DIRECTORY-SERVER, X500-SERVER-USAGE, and
              X500-ADMIN-FACILITY.

        Release Notes and Read Before Installing Document

              Read the release notes before installing the software. Use
              VMSINSTAL OPTIONS N to print the release notes.

              The product documentation includes a Read Before
              Installing document, which you must also read.

        Installing the Digital X.500 Directory Service

              Log in to an account with SETPRV and type:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DXDV031 device OPTIONS N

              The installation procedure displays a menu. Select the
              components that you want to install, and follow the
              instructions. The Base component is mandatory on all
              systems on which you want to run directory applications,
              such as Digital's MAILbus 400 MTA. It is installed
              automatically when you select any other component.

              Note that, with the exception of the Base, components
              you do not specify are deinstalled. You must specify all
              components that you want on the system, including any that
              are already present.

        Handling Errors

              If an error occurs during installation, check the
              prerequisites and refer to Digital X.500 Directory Service
              Problem Solving for details of installation problems.

        Verifying the Installation

              To verify the installation, run SYS$TEST:DXD$IVP.COM.

                                                                       3

 






     Tasks After Installation

           Edit SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM to include the
           following command line:

           $ SUBMIT SYS$STARTUP:DXD$COMMON_STARTUP.COM

           You also need to run that Directory Service startup file
           before configuring the product as described in Digital
           X.500 Directory Service Management.

           If you are reinstalling or upgrading from a previous
           version, then you might have old copies of customized
           schema files. You need to incorporate your customizations
           into the newly installed schema files, and recompile the
           schema before starting the DSA. The Read Before Installing
           document provides further information about upgrading.

     Saving Files on Reinstallation

           The installation procedure saves copies of the following
           files if you reinstall the Directory Service.

              SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]DXD$DSA_STARTUP.NCL
              SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]DXD$DSA_STARTUP.COM
              SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]DXD$DSA_SHUTDOWN.NCL
              SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]DXD$TEMPLATE_STARTUP.NCL
              DXD$DIRECTORY:DXD$ACI_TEMPLATE.DXIM

           Each file is renamed by inserting _SAVn into the file
           name, where n is a number.

           If the installation procedure finds schema files, these
           are moved to a subdirectory called SAVn, for example,
           DXD$DIRECTORY:[DXD$SERVER.SAV1]. The procedure only moves
           schema files that were installed by the Directory Service
           product. Any schema files created by the customer are
           unaffected.

     Installing on Clusters

           Only one node in a cluster can run the server. The
           installation prompts you for the server node name, and
           edits DXD$LOGICALS_STARTUP.COM to define a logical based
           on your answer.

              On a cluster that has multiple system disks (including
              mixed architecture clusters), you must repeat the
              installation for each system disk. All system disks must
              run V3.1 of the Directory Service. You must install the
              same components and specify the same server node during
              each installation.

              The installation registers the DXIM command. To make the
              command available to all cluster nodes, use the following
              command on each node:

              $ INSTALL SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES /REPLACE

              If you prefer, you can use the SYSMAN utility for this
              task.

        Further Information

              Digital X.500 Directory Service Problem Solving contains
              a list of the files installed on your system, their
              locations and approximate sizes. The guide also lists
              errors that you might see during installation and
              verification and explains what to do if they occur.
