           Digital X.500 Directory Service Version 3.1 for OpenVMS VAX
           Systems

           Read Before Installing

           AV-PXGLH-TE


           Prerequisite Software

           Before you install the Digital[TM] X.500 Directory Service make
           sure you have the following installed and working on your system:

           o  OpenVMS[TM] for VAX[TM] V6.1, or later.

           o  DECnet[TM]/OSI[R] V6.2 for OpenVMS VAX or later, including the
              application option.

           Year 2000 Conformance

           With this release, the time matching rules used by the DSA have
           been changed so that dates beyond the year 2000 are recognized by
           the DSA. Time syntaxes, such as, UTC Time, represent the year as a
           two digit number For example, 10.30am GMT on 5th January 1997 is
           expressed in UTC Time as 970105103000Z.

           With the new time matching rules, a time value with a year that is
           less than 50 is assumed by the DSA to be after 2000. For example,
           a time value containing the year 01 is assumed by the DSA to be
           2001.

           A time value with the year equal to or greater than 50 is assumed
           by the DSA to be between 1950 and 1999. For example, a time value
           with the year 97 is assumed by the DSA to be 1997.

           Note that existing time values stored in the directory that con-
           tain a year value less than 50 will be affected by the new time
           matching rules used by the DSA.

           Upgrading from Pre-V2.0 Versions of the Directory Service

           If you are upgrading from V2.0 or later, there is no need to read
           this section.

           If you are upgrading from a pre-V2.0 installation, the V3.1 in-
           stallation converts your existing database to change the object
           identifiers of the attribute types listed in the following table.

 






           ___________________________________________________________________

           Table_1:__Attribute_Types_Whose_Object_Identifiers_Are_Converted___

           Attribute_Type______________New_Object_Identifier__________________

           name                        becomes {attributeType 41}

           givenName                   becomes {attributeType 42}

           initials                    becomes {attributeType 43}

           generationalQualifier       becomes {attributeType 44}

           uniqueIdentifier            becomes {attributeType 45}

           dnQualifier                 becomes {attributeType 46}

           enhancedSearchGuide         becomes {attributeType 47}

           protocolInformation         becomes {attributeType 48}

           distinguishedName___________becomes_{attributeType_49}_____________

           In pre-V2.0 releases of the Directory Service, these attributes
           had the wrong object identifiers, and the V3.1 installation
           corrects them for you. If you are upgrading from a more recent
           version, then this conversion has already happened and is not
           repeated.

                                         WARNING

              If you have a pre-V2.0 installation, and have corrected these
              object identifiers yourself, then do not install V3.1 of
              the Directory Service. Contact Digital for details of how to
              upgrade.

           You must upgrade all pre-V2.0 components of your Directory Service
           as soon as possible. This is because changing object identifiers
           causes interworking problems between pre-V2.0 versions and more
           recent versions. If it is not possible to upgrade all pre-V2.0
           systems for any reason, contact Digital.

           If you have Directory Service components installed on any sys-
           tems that run the ULTRIX[TM] operating system, contact Digital.
           The last version of the Directory Service to support the ULTRIX
           operating system was V1.3, so there is no upgrade option.

           Do not use old schema files instead of the newly installed files,
           as old schema files contain the incorrect object identifiers,
           as well as lacking some new definitions. If you have customized
           the schema, you need to edit your customizations into the newly
           installed schema files. Your old schema files are saved during
           installation.

           Configuration Tutorials

           Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of Digital X.500 Directory Service Man-
           agement provide configuration tutorials. If you are installing
           Digital's Directory Service products for the first time, you might
           find the tutorials a useful introduction to managing the product.
