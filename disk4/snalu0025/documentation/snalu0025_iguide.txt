                                              Preparing for Installation



              Before you install the Digital SNA Application Programming
              Interface for OpenVMS software, referred to as API, you
              should prepare your system.

              This installation involves writing to your system disk.
              Digital recommends that you make a backup copy of your
              system disk before you begin.

        1.1 Checking the Distribution Kit

              Before beginning the installation, check that you have
              a complete distribution kit by comparing the kit against
              the bill of materials (BOM). If any part of the kit is
              missing, contact your Digital representative. Each API
              kit consists of one or more volumes of software media
              (depending on the media) and a set of documentation.

        1.2 OpenVMS System Requirements

              This section discusses OpenVMS requirements and calculates
              parameter values for the API.

        1.2.1 Installation Requirements

              Before you install the API software, verify that
              the specifications in Table 1-1 and the disk space
              requirements in Table 1-2 have been met.

              To determine how much permanent disk space you need after
              installation of a particular language, add the permanent
              disk space required for that language to the disk space
              required for API. For example, on OpenVMS VAX, to the
              permanent disk space for BASIC, which is 78 blocks, add
              1152 blocks, which are required for API. A total of 1230
              blocks are required.

        1.2.1.1 OpenVMS SNA and Gateway Support

              Version 2.4 of the API software also requires one of the
              following system configurations for proper operation:
              Either the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST, DECnet SNA Gateway-CT,
              Digital SNA Domain Gateway-ST, Digital SNA Domain Gateway-
              CT, Digital SNA Peer Server, or systems must be part of

     1.2.2 OpenVMS License Management Facility Requirements

           Before you install API, you should register your Product
           Authorization Key (PAK) with the License Management
           Facility (LMF). The PAK, which contains information
           about the license, is a paper certificate shipped with
           the product.

           During the installation, the system prompts you asking
           if you have registered the Application Programming
           Interface license and loaded the appropriate Product
           Authorization Key (PAK). If you have not already done so,
           you can complete the installation and run the Installation
           Verification Procedure (IVP). The Application Programming
           Interface will not run if you have not registered the
           license or loaded the PAK. Once you perform the license
           registration and have loaded the PAK, you will be able to
           run the Application Programming Interface.

           To register and load the license, log in to the system
           manager's account. Then type the following command:

           @ SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM

           When you are prompted for information, enter the data
           from your PAK. For more information on LMF, see the
           OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual in the OpenVMS
           documentation set.

     1.2.3 OpenVMS Tailor Requirements

           The required classes are: OpenVMS Required Save Set,
           Network Support, Programming Support, and Utilities.
           Be certain these classes are installed on your system
           before installing the product. Refer to OpenVMS Tailor
           documentation in the OpenVMS documentation set for more
           information.

     1.2.4 Calculating the Value for GBLSECTIONS

           Make sure that you have enough global pages and global
           sections free. If there are not enough global pages and
           global sections, the API software cannot be installed as a
           shareable image. You can check the number of global pages
           and global sections available by entering the following
           commands:

     1-4 Preparing for Installation

 






              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN> SHOW GBLPAGES
              SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS

              You can then check the number of global pages and global
              sections in use by entering the following commands:

              $ INSTALL
              INSTALL> LIST/GLOBAL

              By subtracting the second set of values from the first,
              you can determine if there are enough global pages and
              global sections available for your use. If you need to
              modify these values, you must edit the
              SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file and include the following
              lines.

              For OpenVMS VAX:

              ADD_GBLPAGES=68
              ADD_GBLSECTIONS=3

              For OpenVMS Alpha:

              ADD_GBLPAGES=994
              ADD_GBLSECTIONS=4

              After modifying these values, you must run AUTOGEN by
              using the following commands:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN SAVPARAMS GENPARAMS
              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN SETPARAMS REBOOT

              These commands will recompute your system parameters.
              AUTOGEN will also perform an automatic shutdown and reboot
              when it is finished.

        1.3 VMScluster Considerations

              This layered product is fully supported when installed on
              any valid and licensed VMScluster configuration, with the
              following restrictions:

              o  The API must be installed and run on each node in the
                 VMScluster containing a synchronous communications
                 interface connected to an IBM system.

                                          Preparing for Installation 1-5

 






           o  When you run the API in interactive mode, you must run
              it from a node with a synchronous device interface and
              API locally installed.


     1.4 OpenVMS Optional Products

           For general background information on installing optional
           products on an OpenVMS system, refer to the OpenVMS
           Software Installation . This manual has an appendix
           dealing with optional product installation.

     1.5 VMSINSTAL Requirements

           Installing the Application Programming Interface on an
           OpenVMS system involves running the VMSINSTAL procedure.
           The dialogue is self-explanatory. The system tells you to
           answer questions and waits for you to tell it to continue.
           Most questions require a simple YES (Y) or no (N) answer.
           The questions display default answers (where available) in
           the following way:

           [YES]:

           To answer a question with the default YES, press [RET].

           When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks that:

           o  You are logged in to a privileged account.

           o  You have adequate quotas for installation.

           o  All users are logged off.

           Note that the following explanation of VMSINSTAL deals
           with the simplest case; in actual practice, the procedure
           may ask other questions, depending on your configuration
           and the products already installed. Refer to the Guide to
           OpenVMS Software Installation for a full description of
           how VMSINSTAL works.

           To install the distribution kit on your OpenVMS host:

           o  Log in to the system manager's account.

           o  Make sure you have backed up the system disk.

           o  Make sure that you have at least 12,947 free blocks on
              the system disk.

     1-6 Preparing for Installation

 






              o  Make sure that you have 68 global pages free (for
                 OpenVMS VAX) or 944 (for OpenVMS Alpha). (If there are
                 not enough global pages, the API cannot be installed as
                 a shareable image.)

              o  Make sure you have five global sections free.

              o  Make sure that all users are logged out and all batch
                 jobs are complete.

        1.5.1 Using VMSINSTAL

              VMSINSTAL is a command procedure that installs OpenVMS
              layered software products. The VMSINSTAL command line has
              the following format:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SNALU0nnn ddcu: [OPTIONS N]

              where:

              nnn represents the major version number and the current
              maintenance update in that version.

              The first and second digits represent the major version
              number, and the third digit represents the current
              maintenance update version number. For the version number
              of your kit, refer to the label on the distribution kit or
              the BOM. If you do not supply the product name and version
              number, VMSINSTAL prompts you for them.

              ddcu represents a device name for the API installation
              media, where dd is the device code, c is the controller
              id, and u is the unit number.

              It is not necessary to use the console drive. If you do
              not supply the device name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for
              it. MTA0: is the device name used in examples in this
              document.

              OPTIONS N is an optional parameter you should provide if
              you want to be prompted to display or print the release
              notes.

              If you do not include the OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL
              does not prompt you to display or print the release notes.

                                          Preparing for Installation 1-7

 






           When you install a product using VMSINSTAL, you have two
           installation options. Either you can enter the VMSINSTAL
           command line specifying the product name, version number,
           device name, and release notes option, or you can enter
           the following command:

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL

           If you enter the preceding command, VMSINSTAL prompts
           you for the product name, version number, and device name
           during the installation. If you use this command, you do
           not have the option of displaying or printing the release
           notes.

     1.6 Accessing the On-line Release Notes

           This product provides on-line release notes. You should
           review the release notes before installing the product.
           They contain the latest enhancements to the product, which
           may include changes to the installation procedure. If
           you specify the OPTIONS N parameter on the VMSINSTAL
           command line, the system prompts you regarding how you
           would like to see the release notes. After installing
           the product, you can read the release notes in the file
           SYS$HELP:SNALU0vvu.RELEASE_NOTES, where vv is the major
           version number and u is the update number (1 digit).

                                                      Installing the API



              This chapter describes how to install the Digital SNA
              Application Programming Interface for OpenVMS (referred
              to as API). It contains a step-by-step description of the
              installation considerations. The final section includes
              sample system installation logs using PAK information and
              VMSINSTAL.

        2.1 The Installation Procedure

              The API installation consists of a series of questions and
              informational messages. The process takes 5 to 15 minutes
              to complete.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                You can install the API software from two locations:
                the Consolidated Software Distribution CD-ROM or
                a remote node in your local area network using the
                Remote Installation Service (RIS). The VMSINSTAL
                procedure presented in this chapter assumes the API
                software is being installed from your local area
                network.

                To install the API software from the Consolidated
                Software Distribution CD-ROM, see the master
                index table in the document Consolidated Software
                Distribution Disk User's Guide for the directory
                containing the API files.

                _____________________________________________________





                                                  Installing the API 2-1

 






     2.1.1 Running VMSINSTAL

           Digital recommends that you use a hard-copy terminal for
           installing the API software if you would like a copy
           of the installation process. If you have a hard-copy
           terminal, you can produce a copy of the installation
           procedure in a file by typing:

           $ SET HOST 0/LOG=filename

           where:

           filename is the name of the file in which you want the log
           file stored.

           Step 1: Log in to system manager's account.

           To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command
           procedure from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM
           account.

           Username: SYSTEM [RET]
           Password:        [RET]

           Step 2: Invoke VMSINSTAL.

           Use the following syntax to invoke VMSINSTAL:

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SNALU0nnn ddcn: OPTIONS N

           Replace nnn in the product name with the version number of
           the software, for example, SNALU0024.

           Replace ddcn with the name of the device on which you plan
           to mount the media, where dd is the device name, c is the
           controller ID, and n is the unit number.

           OPTIONS N is an optional parameter that indicates you want
           to be prompted to display or print the release notes, or
           copy them to SYS$HELP. If you do not include the OPTIONS
           N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not prompt you to display,
           print, or copy the release notes. Please read the release
           notes before proceeding with this installation.

                      OpenVMS Alpha Software Product Installation Procedure V6.1

           It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh::mm.
           Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

     2-2 Installing the API

 






              Step 3: Product Installation Begins.

              VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing the
              API has been mounted on the specified device and that the
              installation has begun.

              Please mount the first volume of the set on ddcn:
              * Are you ready? YES
              %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, SNALU0 mounted on _ddcn:

              The following products will be processed:

              SNALU0 Vn.n

                  Beginning installation of SNALU0 Vn.n at hh::mm

              %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

              Where n.n is automatically replaced with the version
              number of the API, for example, V2.4.

              Step 4: Select a release notes option.

              If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL,
              the installation procedure prompts you for a release notes
              option.

              Release Notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.
              Additional Release Notes Options:

                  1.  Display release notes
                  2.  Print release notes
                  3.  Both 1 and 2
                  4.  None of the above

              * Select option [2]:

              If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes immediately on your terminal. You can terminate the
              display at any time by pressing <CTRL/C>.

              If you select option 2 or 3, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a
              print queue name:

              Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

              Enter a queue name or press RETURN to send the file to the
              default output print device, SYS$PRINT.

                                                  Installing the API 2-3

 






           No matter which option you select, VMSINSTAL then asks you
           if you want to continue the installation. Answer YES to
           continue or NO to exit VMSINSTAL.

           * Do you want to continue the installation? YES
           %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The products release notes have been successfully
           moved to SYS$HELP.

           Step 5: Register the product with the License Management
           Facility.

           The installation procedure prints out information specific
           to the particular license and asks if you have registered
           and loaded your PAK for the API.

           Product:              SNA-API
           Producer:             DEC
           Version:              n.n
           Release Date:         dd-mmm-yyyy

           * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

           If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, answer NO
           to this question. The installation reminds you to register
           the PAK before you run the product. The installation
           continues.

           Step 6: Select installation options.

           You have the option to purge files from previous versions
           of the API that are superseded by this installation.
           Purging is recommended because it will save disk space.

           * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

           The system now asks if you want to have the IVP run
           automatically at the end of the installation. The IVP
           for the API checks to be sure that the installation is
           successful. You should run the IVP immediately after
           installation.

           * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

           Press RETURN to exit from the procedure, unless you have
           more products to install using VMSINSTAL.

     2-4 Installing the API

 






              Step 7: Select language symbols.

              You have the option of installing only those symbol files
              necessary for the programming languages you are using. You
              need 4138 blocks of disk space to install all the symbol
              files.

              If you do not want all the symbol files offered, answer NO
              to the following:

              * Would you like all the symbol files installed on this system [Y]?

              A NO answer to this question results in a list that
              displays the languages offered and the disk requirements
              for the symbol files of each of those languages.

               Please enter Yes (Y) or No (N) if you want the symbol files
               installed for the following languages:

              *       ADA (XXXX blocks) [N]?
              *       BASIC (XX blocks) [N]?
              *       BLISS (XX blocks) [N]?
              *       CC (XXX blocks) [N]?
              *       FORTRAN (XXX blocks) [N]?
              *       LIBRARY (XX blocks) [N]?
              *       MACRO (XX blocks) [N]?
              *       PASCAL (XXX blocks) [N]?
              *       PLI (XXX blocks) [N]?

                      You have chosen the following languages:
                          ()

              * Is this OK [Y]?

              Step 8: Read informational message.

              The installation procedure now displays the following
              informational message:

              %SNALU0-I-NOQUEST, No further questions will be asked

                      The IVP for this product, SNALU0$IVP.COM, can be found in
                      the SYS$TEST directory.

                      To install the SNALU0SHR.EXE and SNALU0MSG.EXE images as
                      shareable each time the system reboots, you must add the
                      following line to your system startup procedure:

                              $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNALU0$STARTUP

                                                  Installing the API 2-5

 






                   On-line release notes for this product can be found in the file,
                           SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP]SNALU00nn.RELEASE_NOTES

           %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories ...

           Step 9: The IVP is run.

           The installation procedure calls the IVP to verify that
           the API software was successfully installed. The system
           displays the following messages:

           ** Digital SNA Application Programming Interface for OpenVMS Vn.n Installation Test **
           .... Testing API Vn.n file locations
           .... Testing API Vn.n

           ** Digital SNA API for OpenVMS Vn.n Test Successful **

           Step 10: End the installation procedure.

           The following messages indicate that the entire installa-
           tion procedure is complete:

                 Installation of SNALU0 Vn.n completed at hh::mm

                 VMSINSTALL procedure done at hh::mm

     2.2 Postinstallation Considerations

           The installation procedure for API installs SNALU0SHR.EXE,
           SNALU0MSG.EXE, and SNAGWAMSG.EXE files as shareable
           images. Section 2.2.1 lists the files added to the system.

           To install API on other nodes that share a common system
           disk in a cluster environment, run the SYS$STARTUP:SNALU0$STARTUP.COM
           command procedure on each node. For nodes in a cluster
           environment that do not share a common system disk, the
           API must be installed on each node. Section 2.2.2 shows
           the command procedure for installing API as a shareable
           image.

           Verification of the installation can be done either during
           installation through the VMSINSTAL utility or at any other
           time by running the SNALU0$IVP.COM command procedure found
           in the SYS$TEST directory. This command procedure verifies
           that the API has been installed correctly on your system.
           This command procedure does not verify connectivity
           between IBM and either the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST, DECnet
           SNA Gateway-CT, Digital SNA Domain Gateway-CT, Digital SNA
           Domain Gateway-ST, Digital SNA Peer Server or OpenVMS SNA.

     2-6 Installing the API

 






              Section 2.2.3 shows the command procedure for running the
              IVP. The API Help file can be added to an editor's Help
              file. Section 2.2.4 shows the command procedure for adding
              API Help.

        2.2.1 Files Created During Installation

              During installation, the files listed below are placed on
              your system.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                API V2.0 or later does not provide the object
                library, SNA.OLB. API V2.4 or later does not provide
                the shareable image SNASHR.EXE. If SNASHR.EXE is on
                the system, it will not be removed. If you wish to
                use existing applications, you must link them with
                SNALU0SHR.EXE.

           You can find HELP information for the API in the system
           help facility under the topic SNA_API.

     2.2.2 Installing the API as a Shareable Image

           The file SYS$STARTUP:SNALU0$STARTUP.COM contains the
           start-up command procedure for the API. To install the
           API as a shareable image, execute the command procedure as
           follows:

           $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNALU0$STARTUP

           Include the above command in your system start-up
           procedure to automatically install the API as a shareable
           image when you boot the system.

     2-8 Installing the API

 






        2.2.3 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) verifies the
              success of the installation. It checks that the new files
              were transferred to their proper locations and that files
              are not in the wrong location. If you encounter problems
              using the API, you should run the IVP as a first step in
              finding a solution. The IVP is designed to catch problems
              with missing files and old files left on your system. If a
              problem develops with the API, run the IVP first. To run
              the IVP after you install the product, invoke the command:

              $ @SYS$TEST:SNALUO$IVP

              If the IVP fails, correct the situation, and run the
              IVP again. Section 2.3.1 describes IVP failures in more
              detail.

        2.2.4 Adding the SNA_API Help File to the Help File of an
              Editor

              The API HELP information that is added to the HELPLIB
              file during installation can also be inserted into the
              HELP file of an editor for programmers who use editors
              to develop Digital SNA or OpenVMS SNA applications. The
              following commands perform this operation. These commands
              require system manager privileges.

              $ LIBRARY/HELP/EXTRACT=SNAAPI/OUTPUT=SNAAPI SYS$HELP:HELPLIB
              $ LIBRARY/HELP/INSERT SYS$HELP:xxxHELP SNAAPI
              $ DELETE SNAAPI.HLP;*

              where xxx is the name of your editor. For example, EDT or
              LSE.

        2.2.5 License Management Facility in a VMScluster

              Refer to the OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual
              for information on managing licenses in a VMScluster
              environment.

     2.3 Error Recovery

           If errors occur during the installation or when the IVP is
           running, VMSINSTAL displays error messages.

           Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
           following conditions exist:

           1. The operating system version is incorrect.

           2. A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

           3. Quotas necessary for successful installation are
              insufficient.

           4. System parameter values for successful installation are
              insufficient.

           5. The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

           6. The product is not properly licensed.

           7. Your system has insufficient disk space.

           For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
           conditions, see the OpenVMS documentation on system
           messages, recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software
           installation. If any of these conditions exist, you should
           take the appropriate action as described in the message.
           (You might need to change a system parameter or increase
           an authorized quota value.) These requirements are part of
           the installation requirements in Chapter 1 of this manual.

              With the release of API Version 2.4, the PASCAL environ-
              ment copies of the following files are no longer with the
              kit:

              o  SNALIBDEF

              o  SNALU0DEF

              o  SNALIBDEF.PEN

              o  SNALU0DEF.PEN

              You can create your own copy of the environment files
              by executing the following OpenVMS commands. This only
              applies if PASCAL is installed with a valid PAK on the
              system where you want the environment to exist.

              $ PASCAL SYS$LIBRARY:SNALIBDEF.PAS /ENVIRONMENT=SYS$LIBRARY:SNALIBDEF.PEN
              $ PASCAL SYS$LIBRARY_SNALU0DEF.PAS_FOR_PEN /ENVIRONMENT=SYS$LIBRARY:SNALU0DEF.PEN

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                You must build the environment files on your own
                system for the following reasons:

                1. Linking the environment file created on an
                   OpenVMS Version 6.1 or Version 6.2 system might
                   not allow the creation of a good executable on
                   and OpenVMS Version 7.0 system.

                2. To avoid compilation differences based on the
                   versions of compilers at each installtion, it is
                   wiser to produce the environment file from the
                   PASCAL compiler on the system where the API is
                   installed.
