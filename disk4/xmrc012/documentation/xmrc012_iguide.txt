     Installation Prerequisites

           Before you install the MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway
           for OpenVMS VAX, do the following:

           o  Ensure the following software is installed on the
              system where you intend to install the MAILbus 400
              Message Router Gateway:

              -  OpenVMS VAX Version 6.1

              -  DECnet[TM]/OSI[R] for OpenVMS VAX, Version 6.0

              -  The Base component of the MAILbus 400 MTA for
                 OpenVMS VAX, Version 1.4

           o  Ensure you have access to an account with the SYSPRV
              privilege, for example, the SYSTEM account.

           o  Back up your system disk using the OpenVMS Backup
              Utility.

           o  Register a valid license, MAILBUS-400-MR-GATEWAY, where
              you intend to install the MAILbus 400 Message Router
              Gateway. Use the OpenVMS License Management Facility
              (LMF) to do this.

           o  For an upgrade, make sure that the MAILbus 400 Message
              Router Gateway is shut down before you install the new
              version. Use the following command to shut down the
              MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:XMR$COMMON_SHUTDOWN

           o  You can modify the software on your VAX or MicroVAX[TM]
              system with the VMSTAILOR utility. Ensure you have
              not removed the Object and Shareable Image libraries
              software; this is required by the MAILbus 400 Message
              Router Gateway.

           For more information about the OpenVMS Backup utility,
           VMSTAILOR, and the OpenVMS License Management Facility,
           see the OpenVMS system management documentation.

              need to know the name of the device where the installation
              media will be mounted or loaded.

        Disk Space Required

              The MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway requires 6500
              blocks on the system disk during the installation. After
              installation, the MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway
              requires 6000 blocks on the system disk.

        Time Required

              The time it takes to install the MAILbus 400 Message
              Router Gateway depends on the resources available on your
              system. The installation takes approximately five minutes
              on a VAXstation[TM] 3100.

        Installing the MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway

              Before installing the MAILbus 400 Message Router
              Gateway, read Chapter 3 of MAILbus 400 Message Router
              Gateway for OpenVMS VAX: Managing for information about
              preinstallation tasks.

              Install the MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway on one
              node in a VAXcluster[TM] or on each single node where
              you want to operate a MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway.
              If Message Router is also installed on the VAXcluster,
              install the MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway on the
              primary Message Router node. See MAILbus 400 Message
              Router Gateway for OpenVMS VAX: Managing for information
              about the primary Message Router node.

              From an account with the SYSPRV privilege on the node
              where you want to install the MAILbus 400 Message Router
              Gateway, type:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL XMR012 device OPTIONS N

              where device is the name of the device where the
              installation media is to be mounted, for example MUA0.

                                                                       3

 






     Verifying the Installation

           If you did not run the installation verification procedure
           automatically during installation, type the following
           command to verify that all installed files are in the
           correct locations and have the correct protections:

           $ @SYS$TEST:XMR$IVP

           If the installation verification procedure fails for any
           reason, error messages are displayed on the screen.

     After the Installation

           For information about setup tasks required after
           installation, see MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway for
           OpenVMS VAX: Managing.

           The MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway requires access
           to Message Router, Version 3.3A. Before you set up the
           MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway, ensure that this
           version of Message Router is available on your network.

           If WPS-PLUS[TM], DECdx[TM] bodypart conversions or
           conversions between ODIF and DDIF[TM] bodyparts are
           required, refer to the MAILbus 400 MTA documentation set
           for information about converters for these bodyparts.
