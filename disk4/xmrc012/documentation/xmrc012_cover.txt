           This Cover Letter lists the functional changes that have been in-
           troduced in Version 1.2C of the MAILbus 400[TM] Message Router[TM]
           Gateway for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM].

           This Cover Letter also describes how to install Version 1.2C of
           the Gateway.

           Functional Changes to the MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway

           The following changes have been made to the Gateway for Version
           1.2C. Full details of these changes are given in the MAILbus 400
           Message Router Gateway for OpenVMS VAX: Release Notes.

           o  The MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway V1.2C has been tested
              successfully for full functional capability on OpenVMS V7.2. No
              problem was encountered during the tests.

           o  If the Gateway receives a message from the MAILbus 400 MTA
              which contains "+/-0000" in the arrival time attribute which is
              an offset from the GMT, the Gateway now translates the message
              which is acceptable to the Message Router.

           o  The Gateway now understands the complex General Text Body part
              invocation/designation sequences while translating it to Mes-
              sage Router text body part.
