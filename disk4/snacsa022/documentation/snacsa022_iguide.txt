                                                                 Preface



              The DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport for OpenVMS
              (called the Gateway-CT in this manual) is a system of
              hardware and software that provides an interface between
              Digital Equipment Corporation and International Business
              Machines Corporation networks. Because the Gateway-CT can
              handle the different communications protocols between a
              Digital and an IBM[R] network, it enables certain nodes in
              a Digital DECnet[TM] network to communicate with one or
              more hosts in an IBM SNA network. The Gateway-CT provides
              an interface to the IBM network through a channel directly
              attached to the IBM host. The Gateway-CT software runs
              on either a DEC ChannelServer or a DEC ChannelServer II
              hardware platform.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Throughout this manual, the hardware server box
                is generically referred to as the ChannelServer.
                Where differences occur, distinctions between the
                DEC ChannelServer and the DEC ChannelServer II are
                noted.

              When you issue NCP, NCL, and SNANCP commands, many
              component names, parameters, and qualifiers require
              additional information. In most cases, the syntax of this
              additional information follows a standard set of rules.
              (Exceptions to these rules are noted where appropriate.)
              All numeric values are in decimal form and range from 0 to
              65,535 unless otherwise specified.






































                                                                      ix

 






           NCL, SNANCP, and NCP commands use the following conven-
           tions:

           circuit-id  A string of characters whose exact syntax is
                       that for a DECnet or SNA circuit identifica-
                       tion.

                       On DECnet nodes, circuit identification takes
                       the following form:

                            dev-c

                       where dev is a device name and c is a decimal
                       number (0 or a positive integer) designating
                       the device's hardware controller.

                       Channel-attached circuits are identified by a
                       string in the form CHAN-n, where n indicates
                       the number of the circuit.

                       On the Gateway node, the Ethernet circuit is
                       identified by the string ETHERNET.

           E-address   A string of 12 hexadecimal digits, represented
                       by 6 bytes separated by hyphens (for example,
                       08-00-2B-0A-6C-F3). The string indicates the
                       Ethernet hardware address.

           line-id     A string of characters whose exact syntax is
                       that for a DECnet or SNA line identification.

                       On DECnet nodes, line identification takes one
                       of the following formats:

                            dev-c

                       where dev is a device name and c is a decimal
                       number (0 or a positive integer) designating
                       the device's hardware controller.

                       On the Gateway node, the Ethernet line is
                       identified by the string ETHERNET.

                       Channel-attached lines are identified as a
                       string in the form CQ-n, where n indicates the
                       number of the line.

     x

 







              node-       A numeric value ranging from 1.1 to 63.1023,
              address     composed of an area number to the left of
                          the period followed by a node number to the
                          right of the period. If the area number is
                          not supplied, the area number of the executor
                          node is used. The default area number for the
                          executor is 1.

              node-id     Either a node-name or a node-address.

              node-name   A string of up to 6 alphanumeric characters
                          containing at least 1 alphabetic character.

                            Preparing for Installation and Configuration



              The DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport for OpenVMS
              is a system of hardware and software that handles protocol
              differences between IBM[R] SNA networks and Digital
              Equipment Corporation DECnet[TM] networks. DECnet
              SNA access routines use the Gateway-CT to access IBM
              subsystems, applications, and programs.

              Gateway-CT V2.1 combines management software with the
              Gateway-CT software. There is no longer a separate process
              for installing these two software components. As part
              of the installation process, you are given the option
              of installing the management software as a separate
              entity; installing the Gateway-CT diagnostic software;
              or installing the entire software package, which includes
              the management, diagnostic, and load host software. This
              chapter describes the preparations you must make before
              you install and configure the Gateway-CT.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                This chapter deals with DECnet/VAX commands and
                examples, and these may be different for DECnet
                /OSI. See Section 3.1 and Section 4.3 for complete
                examples of a configuration and loading of the
                software on a DECnet/OSI system. Also, refer to
                the DECnet/OSI NCL Reference Manual for information
                on NCL commands.

     1.1 Inspecting the Distribution Kit

           The Software Bill of Materials (BOM) included with
           your distribution kit specifies the contents of the
           distribution kit. Carefully compare the items you received
           with the items listed in the BOM. If any components are
           missing or damaged, contact Digital Equipment Corporation
           before continuing with the installation.

        1.2 Preparing the IBM SNA Environment

              You must prepare certain software components in the IBM
              environment before you can use the Gateway-CT software.
              The DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport Guide to IBM
              Parameters explains which IBM parameters must be correctly
              defined for successful communication between the IBM host
              and your Gateway-CT. Chapter 3 explains how IBM parameter
              settings can affect parameter settings for various Gateway
              components.

              You should view the Digital documentation as an adjunct
              to the IBM documentation; the IBM documentation remains
              the authoritative source for IBM software concepts and
              procedures.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Since IBM system programmers reconfigure and
                generate their systems according to a set schedule,
                give them as much advance notice as possible to
                prepare for the Gateway-CT installation.

                _____________________________________________________

        1.3 Identifying Where the Gateway-CT Software Will Be Installed

              Before you install the Gateway-CT software, you must
              identify the DECnet nodes which will contain the software.
              A DECnet/SNA network with a Gateway-CT has the following
              DECnet nodes:

              o  Gateway node: A DEC ChannelServer II or a DEC
                 ChannelServer running the Gateway-CT software.

              o  Gateway load host node: A DECnet for OpenVMS node from
                 which you load the Gateway-CT system image onto the
                 Gateway node. You must install both the management and
                 the Gateway-CT software on the load host node.

                 In environments where reliability is critical, you
                 should install the entire Gateway-CT software kit
                 (installation option 3) on at least one additional
                 load host. The second load host can then load the
                 software onto the Gateway if the first load host is
                 unavailable. The second load host can also be used to

                        Preparing for Installation and Configuration 1-3

 






              receive dumps from the Gateway. Any DECnet node that is
              running OpenVMS VAX V5.4 or later, or OpenVMS AXP V1.5,
              and is connected to the same Ethernet as the Gateway
              can be used as a load host.









































     1-4 Preparing for Installation and Configuration

 






              o  Access node: A DECnet node with one or more access
                 routine products. The access node must be running the
                 version of the operating system software (OpenVMS[R],
                 ULTRIX[R], or MS-DOS[R]) required by the access
                 routine.


        1.4 Verifying Required Disk Space

              Installing the Gateway-CT kit requires 4800 free blocks
              on the system disk. If you want just the management
              software, you still require 4800 free blocks for the
              installation, but only 1700 blocks are allocated after
              the installation is completed. Use the SHOW DEVICE command
              to check available disk space.

              The Gateway-CT software supports OpenVMS tailoring for
              installation on systems that have limited system disk
              space. The Gateway-CT Software Product Description (SPD)
              explains OpenVMS tailoring and lists the necessary OpenVMS
              system classes. The OpenVMS SPD provides more information
              on classes and OpenVMS tailoring.

        1.5 Verifying Necessary Privileges

              To install Gateway-CT, you must be logged in to an account
              that has SYSPRV. Use the SHOW PROCESS/PRIVILEGES command
              to check privileges.

              For DECnet/OSI, you must also grant the NET$MANAGE rights
              identifier to the account from which the configuration
              SNACSA$CONFIGURE.COM is being performed. The procedure
              will prompt you for this, and will not run until the
              identifier is granted.

        1.6 Verifying Required Process Account Quotas

              To install Gateway-CT, the account you use must have
              sufficient quotas. Table 1-1 summarizes the required
              process quotas.

           Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
           the current values of these quotas with the requirements
           for installing Gateway-CT. The following example uses the
           SYSTEM account:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
           $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
           UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

           To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
           Authorize Utility's MODIFY command. For more information,
           see the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual.





     1-6 Preparing for Installation and Configuration

 






        1.7 Verifying the Required OpenVMS Version

              Your OpenVMS system must be running either OpenVMS VAX
              V5.4 or
              OpenVMS AXP V1.5. Use the SHOW SYSTEM command to determine
              the current version. If you do not have the required
              version, you must install it before you install the
              Gateway-CT software. The OpenVMS System Manager's Manual
              explains how to install OpenVMS software.

        1.8 Installing DECnet SNA OpenVMS Access Routines

              DECnet SNA OpenVMS access routines allow you to communi-
              cate with programs running on the IBM system. Each access
              routine is installed separately. This manual provides
              instructions for installing the Gateway-CT software only.
              The SPD for Gateway-CT provides a complete list of access
              routines.

        1.9 Backing Up Your System Disk

              Before you start an installation that involves writing to
              your system disk, Digital Equipment Corporation recommends
              that you make a backup copy of your system disk. The
              OpenVMS System Manager's Manual explains how to back up
              your system disk.

        1.10 Checking Required OpenVMS and DECnet Files

              The installation process checks that NETPROXY.DAT and
              RIGHTSLIST.DAT exist on your system. These files must
              reside in SYS$SYSTEM or you need to define system logical
              names that point to their locations. If the files do not
              exist, the installation procedure asks if you want to
              create them. Respond Yes to these prompts if they appear.

              If SYSUAF.DAT does not exist on your system, the
              installation will fail.

     1.11 Configuration Considerations

           When the load host is a member of an homogeneous
           VMScluster[TM], you must execute at least Part 1 of the
           Gateway-CT configuration procedure on the load host node
           itself. If more than one cluster member will be used as a
           load host, then you must execute Part 1 on each load host.
           This is necessary because the load host's DECnet SERVICE
           CIRCUIT parameter (in the DECnet for OpenVMS definition of
           the Gateway node) is hardware dependent.

           To have a distinct Gateway node definition for each
           cluster member, the DECnet for OpenVMS remote node
           name database (NETNODE_REMOTE.DAT) must be located in
           the system-specific directory. DECnet for OpenVMS is
           configured this way by default.

           Only Part 1 of the configuration procedure needs to be
           executed on each load host. Parts 2 and 3 need only be
           executed once since they simply create files that are
           located in the common directory.

     1.12 Preparing for the Configuration

           After you install the Gateway-CT software on the load
           host, you configure the Gateway-CT system by running
           SNACSA$CONFIGURE.COM, a command procedure that generates
           the initial configuration by performing the following
           steps using default information and information you
           provide:

           o  Part 1: Defines the Gateway node in the load host's
              DECnet database.

           o  Part 2: Creates a command file that configures the SNA
              database in the Gateway.

           o  Part 3: Creates a command file that configures the
              DECnet database in the Gateway.






     1-8 Preparing for Installation and Configuration

 






        1.13 Part 1: Information About the Gateway Definition in the
             Load Host

              In Part 1 of the configuration procedure, you define
              information about the Gateway node in the DECnet database
              on the load host. This information is used for loading
              and dumping. This part of the configuration also defines
              the SNAINI object and creates a proxy account for the
              Gateway-CT initialization. The proxy account maps the
              remote username, gateway_name::SNA$GO, to the local
              username, SNA$CSV.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If you are upgrading the Gateway-CT software (not
                performing the initial installation), you only need
                to complete Part 1 of the configuration to change
                the Gateway load file. The procedure will determine
                the current settings and display those settings as
                the defaults.

           Figure 1-2 shows Part 1 of the Gateway-CT Configuration
           Worksheet.

           The sections that follow explain the information you need
           to record in Part 1 of the worksheet.

           Gateway Node Name
           This is the name of the Gateway-CT node (1 to 6 alphanu-
           meric characters). The name must be unique within the
           DECnet network.

           Gateway Node Address
           This is the DECnet address of the Gateway node in the
           format aa.nnnn where aa is the (optional) DECnet area
           number ranging from 1 to 63 (decimal) and nnnn is the
           DECnet node number ranging from 1 to 1023 (decimal). The
           address must be unique within the DECnet network.

              Ethernet Hardware Address
              The Ethernet hardware address of the Ethernet port for the
              Gateway node. Enter this address either as 12 hexadecimal
              digits or as six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by
              hyphens. For example, the following expressions specify
              the same address:

                  08002B08CCB3  or  08-00-2B-08-CC-B3

              If this is a new node or if the Ethernet controller in
              the node has been changed, you can find the address
              on the label on the DELQA or the DESQA (on the back
              of the DEC ChannelServer or the DEC ChannelServer II,
              respectively). You can also find the address for both the
              DEC ChannelServer and the DEC ChannelServer II by entering
              the following at the console prompt:

              >>>E/P/W/N:5 20001920
                P 20001920 FF08
                P 20001922 FF00
                P 20001924 FF2B
                P 20001926 FF0F
                P 20001928 FF5B
                P 2000192A FF96
              >>>

              You derive the Ethernet address by taking the last two
              hexadecimal digits of the lines displayed (08-00-2B-0F-5B-
              96 in the example).

              In addition, you can find the address for the DEC ChannelServer II
              by entering the following at the console prompt:

              >>>SHOW ETHERNET
              Ethernet Adapter 0 (774440)
              -XQA0 (08-00-2B-0F-5B-96)
              >>>

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The SHOW ETHERNET command works with the
                DEC ChannelServer II only.

           Host's Ethernet Circuit Name
           The name of the Ethernet circuit that connects the load
           host to the Gateway-CT. The Gateway node makes service
           requests for loading and dumping on this circuit.

           Enter the circuit-id for this node using the syntax dev-c
           where dev is the Ethernet controller type (QNA, BNA, SVA,
           etc.) and c is a decimal number (0 or a positive integer)
           that designates the hardware controller number for the
           device.

           Dump File Device and Directory
           The device and directory on the load host which will
           contain the dump file should the Gateway node perform
           an up-line dump. The dump file is not created until it is
           required.

           The default device and directory is SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV].
           Ensure that the specified device always has enough free
           space for the dump file. The size of your Gateway's dump
           file can vary depending on your hardware platform (amount
           of memory your system has):

           o  If you have a DEC Channelserver (with 5 megabytes
              of memory), the dump file can be a maximum of 10,240
              blocks.

           o  If you have a DEC Channelserver II (with 16 megabytes
              of memory), the dump file can be a maximum of 32,768
              blocks.

           If there is insufficient space on the specified device,
           the system issues a warning message.

     1.14 Part 2: Information About the SNA Database in the Gateway

           In Part 2 of the configuration procedure, you define the
           following Gateway components:

           o  Lines

           o  Circuits

           o  Physical units (PUs)

           o  Access names

              Figure 1-3 shows Part 2 of the Gateway-CT Configuration
              Worksheet.


              The sections that follow explain the information you need
              to record in Part 2 of the worksheet.

        1.14.1 Defining the Channel-Attached Line

              The information in this section defines the channel-
              attached line, CQ-0.

              Number of Circuits
              The number of circuits to be configured for the line. Each
              circuit corresponds to a channel address on the line; you
              should specify the same number of circuits as there are
              channel addresses defined on the IBM side for this line.
              The default is 1.

              Channel Type
              The type of channel used. The channel type can be byte
              multiplexer, block multiplexer, or selector. Ask your IBM
              system programmer for the type of channel to specify. The
              default is block multiplexer.

              Forced Burst
              The type of transfer mode used on a byte multiplexer
              channel. Enter Y if forced-burst mode is to be enabled
              for the line or N if forced-burst mode is to be disabled.
              This information is only required if you specify a byte
              multiplexer channel.

              Line Buffer Size
              The maximum size of buffers used to receive request
              /response units (RUs) transmitted by the IBM host.
              Determine the buffer size by adding 9 bytes to the maximum
              RU size the IBM host will send to the Gateway. The default
              is 8201 which allows RUs up to 8192 bytes. Maximum buffer
              size is 8250 bytes.

     1.14.2 Defining Channel-Attached Circuits

           Information in this section is used to define each
           channel-attached circuit.

           Circuit Name
           The circuit name in the format CHAN-n where n is an
           integer ranging from 1 to 4.

           Channel Address
           The channel address of the Gateway-CT specified as three
           hexadecimal digits. Obtain the channel address from
           your IBM system programmer. There is no default channel
           address.

     1.14.3 Defining Physical Units

           The information in this section defines the PU for each
           channel-attached circuit; you define one PU for each
           circuit. Physical units (PUs) provide the SNA physical
           unit services for the Gateway node.

           LU list
           The logical units (LUs) that are defined for the PU.
           Specify the available LU addresses as a list of decimal
           number ranges from 1-255. For example, define LUs 1
           through 75, LUs 101 through 200, and LU 215 as follows:

           1-75,101-200,215

           DECnet/SNA access routines can use only those LUs defined
           in the list. Any request for communication with an LU not
           in the list will be rejected. Also, the LUs listed must
           correspond with the LU addresses defined in the LOCADDR
           parameter for the IBM ACF/VTAM LU macro; your IBM system
           programmer can supply you with these addresses.

     1.14.4 Defining Access Names

           The information in this section is used to define
           access names. Access names are a convenient way to pass
           information about the type of session being requested
           when an LU-LU session is being established. DECnet SNA
           Gateway for Channel Transport and Gateway for Synchronous
           Transport Management (OpenVMS) explains access names in
           greater detail.

     1-14 Preparing for Installation and Configuration

 






              The following information should be completed for each
              access name that you want to define.

              Access Name
              The access name specified as 1 to 16 alphanumeric
              characters; for example, CICS.

              PU Name
              The PU used to access the IBM system. Enter the PU in the
              format SNA-n, for example, SNA-0. You can define more than
              one PU per access name. You are required to enter at least
              one PU per access name.

              LU List
              The list of LUs, for a given PU, that can use this access
              name. When setting an LU list for the access name, you
              must first specify a particular PU. Enter a list of
              numbers or number ranges separated by commas. For example,
              the following list specifies LUs 1 through 50, LUs 100
              through 150, and LU 160:

              1-50,100-150,160

              IBM Application Name
              The name of the IBM application for the access name. Enter
              1 through 8 alphanumeric characters. Sessions established
              with this access name connect to the designated IBM
              application. If you need to specify this parameter, ask
              the IBM system programmer for the name.

              IBM Logon Mode Name
              The IBM ACF/VTAM Logon Mode Table entry that is used at
              the start of each session. Enter 1 through 8 alphanumeric
              characters. The Logon Mode Table entry can specify the
              protocol rules for the session. If you specify no logon
              mode name, the default entry for the LU address, as
              defined on the IBM system, is used. The name should
              correspond with the operand label of an IBM ACF/VTAM
              MODEENT macro.

              IBM User Data
              An optional string of user data, which will be passed to
              the session partner. Enter 1 through 32 characters. The
              format of the data is specific to the IBM application

                       Preparing for Installation and Configuration 1-15

 






           acting as the session partner. Check with the IBM system
           programmer for the requirements of this field.

     1.14.5 Defining Servers

           The information in this section is used to define the DHCF
           server.

           The system automatically defines all parameters for the
           SNA-ACCESS and RJE servers. The configuration procedure
           will also define all parameters for the DHCF server except
           for the LU list information.

           LU List for DHCF
           A list of LUs to be allocated to the DHCF server. Enter
           a list of numbers or ranges separated by commas, for
           example, 20-30.

     1.15 Part 3: Information About the DECnet Database in the
          Gateway

           In Part 3 of the configuration procedure you provide
           information for the DECnet database in the Gateway-CT,
           which initializes the DECnet database components in the
           Gateway-CT each time the gateway is loaded. You can edit
           this file to customize your configuration.

           Each time the Gateway software is loaded, the Gateway node
           performs the following steps to initialize the database:

           o  Reads all the nodes defined in the DECnet database on
              the load host.

           o  Selects the nodes that are in its area (that is, nodes
              that have the same DECnet area number as the Gateway
              node).

           o  Defines all the nodes in the same DECnet area in the
              Gateway node's DECnet database.

           o  Requests that the load host execute the command
              procedure that is created in this part of the
              configuration procedure. This file specifies the
              privileged username and password for access control
              of the Gateway-CT.

              Figure 1-4 shows Part 3 of the Gateway-CT Configuration
              Worksheet.

              The sections that follow explain the information you need
              to record in Part 3 of the worksheet.

              Privileged Username and Privileged Password
              The privileged username and password (both 1-16 alphanu-
              meric characters in length) that control access to the
              following Gateway functions:

              o  NCP CLEAR, LOOP, SET, and ZERO commands

              o  SNANCP CLEAR, LOOP, SET, SHOW LU (for authorization
                 information), and ZERO commands

              o  NETTRACE commands

              o  SNATRACE commands

              DECnet Service Password
              The password required to trigger the bootstrap mechanism
              on the target node. The password can be up to 16 hexadec-
              imal digits. For Ethernet circuits, the password ranges
              from
              0 to FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. If you choose the default, no
              password is set.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Digital Equipment Corporation recommends that
                you select a service password that is at least 6
                hexadecimal digits long.

                                      Installing the Gateway-CT Software



              This chapter explains how to install the Gateway-CT
              software for DECnet/VAX. Make sure you install the
              required hardware and software and prepare the IBM SNA
              environment before you begin the installation.

              The procedure for installing files on an OpenVMS system
              is automated. You simply answer questions displayed while
              the procedure (VMSINSTAL) runs. Most questions require
              a simple yes or no answer. The Gateway-CT installation
              should take no longer than 15 minutes, depending on the
              type of medium you use. The estimated installation time
              does not include preparation time.

              The following illustration shows how the installation
              information is presented.

              Default answers appear in brackets throughout the
              installation procedure. Press <Return> to accept a default
              answer. Press <Ctrl/Y> to abort the installation procedure
              at any time; later, you can restart the installation at 2.

     2-2 Installing the Gateway-CT Software

 






              1  Digital Equipment Corporation recommends that you
                 install software from the system manager's account
                 [SYSTEM] with your default device and directory set to
                 SYS$UPDATE.

              2  VMSINSTAL prompts you if you do not supply the product
                 and device names. If you want to be prompted for the
                 product name, device name, and installation options,
                 type the following:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL <Return>

                 ddcu:
                 A device name where the distribution kit will be
                 mounted for the Gateway-CT installation media, where dd
                 is the device, c is the controller, and u is the unit
                 number. It is not necessary to use the console drive to
                 install Gateway-CT.

                 OPTIONS N
                 Specifying this optional parameter allows you to
                 display or print the release notes. If you do not
                 include the OPTIONS N parameter (excluding the
                 brackets), VMSINSTAL copies the release notes to
                 SYS$HELP. VMSINSTAL also provides several other
                 options. For more information on options, see your
                 processor-specific installation/operations guide.

              3  If users are logged in, you are asked whether you want
                 to continue the installation. To continue, type YES
                 and press <Return>. To stop the installation, press
                 <Return>.

              4  Before you proceed with the installation, make sure you
                 have a good backup copy. If you are satisfied with the
                 backup of your system disk, press <Return>. If you do
                 not have a good backup copy, type NO and press <Return>
                 to end the installation.

              5  This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N at 2.

                 If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes. Press <Ctrl/C> to terminate the display.

              If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a
              queue name. Either type a queue name and press <Return>
              or press <Return> to send the file to the default
              output print device.

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes and then prompts you for a queue name.

              If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL does not display or
              print the release notes.

           6  To continue the installation, type YES and press
              <Return>. If you type NO and press <Return>, VMSINSTAL
              moves the release notes to SYS$HELP and ends the
              installation.

           7  You have three installation options. The default
              selection, (3), installs the complete Gateway-CT
              software kit, including management and diagnostics.
              To start this process, press <Return>. This option
              requires that the product authorization key (PAK) be
              registered and loaded. Failure to do this causes the
              installation process to fail with an error message
              notifying you that the license must be installed. Refer
              to the PAK installation procedure in Chapter 1 for
              details. After registering and loading the PAK, restart
              the installation from step 2.

              If you want to install just the Gateway management
              software, enter 1, press <Return>, and proceed with the
              remainder of the installation procedure.

              If you want to install just the DEC ChannelServer II
              diagnostic software, enter 2 and press <Return>. If you
              select option 2, the following messages display:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to
                                      their target directories...

                      Installation of SNACSA V2.1 completed at 15:54

                      VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

           8  At this prompt, press <Return> to start event logging.
              If you want to manually start event logging later, type
              NO and press <Return>. Because the event logger must
              be running for a DECnet node to log SNA Gateway event
              messages, Digital recommends that you start the event
              logger at this time.

           9  Add this command to your system startup file so that
              event logging and NETTRACE begin automatically at
              system startup.

           10 If you responded NO to the prompt at item 8, the
              event logger command in SNAGM$STARTUP.COM is dis-
              abled. To enable the command at a later time, edit
              SNAGM$STARTUP.COM in SYS$STARTUP, and remove the

     * This product needs a rights database (RIGHTSLIST)

     * Do you want to create RIGHTSLIST.DAT [YES]?  12

     A directory and account must be created for use by the

              11 If this option displays, the file NETPROXY.DAT, which
                 contains the proxy login entries that allow remote
                 users access to your system, does not exist. Press
                 <Return> to create this file. Type NO and press
                 <Return> and the installation ends; no software is
                 installed.

                 The configuration procedure uses NETPROXY.DAT to create
                 a proxy for the Gateway account.

              12 If this option displays, RIGHTSLIST.DAT does not exist.
                 Press <Return> and the system creates the file. Type
                 NO and press <Return> and the installation ends; no
                 software is installed.

                 RIGHTSLIST.DAT is a collection of data that the system
                 maintains and uses to define and associate identifiers
                 with the holders of those identifiers.

              13 You are prompted for a UIC only if the account does
                 not exist. If the account already exists, the system
                 displays the following:

                 %SNACSA-I-USREX, username SNA$CSV already exists -
                                  UIC [56,56]

                 If no UIC exits for SNA$CSV, you are prompted to supply
                 one; a default account of [56,56] is provided. If
                 this is acceptable, press <Return>. You can specify
                 a different UIC if you choose, but ensure that you
                 specify a unique UIC (not a system UIC and not one that
                 is in a group with other UICs).

              14 A directory and an account are created for the configu-
                 ration files. If the directory SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]
                 already exists, the Gateway-CT uses the existing
                 directory. If the directory SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]
                 does not exist, it is created during the installation
                 procedure.

              15 The installation verification procedure (IVP) runs
                 tests to check whether the installation procedure was
                 successful. Press <Return> to run the IVP after the
                 installation. If you do not want to run the IVP, type
                 NO and press <Return>.

           16 The system disk might contain previous versions of
              the Gateway-CT files. The files are replaced during
              installation with new files, but the old files are
              not automatically purged. Digital recommends purging.
              Press <Return> to purge the files, or type NO and press
              <Return> to retain them.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              System images from previous versions of the Gateway-

        No more questions...  17

        To create the initial configuration files for your Gateway, invoke
        the following configuration procedure, thus:

                $ @SYS$MANAGER:SNACSA$CONFIGURE

        If this is an update to a previous version, invoke the above configuration
        procedure and execute Part 1 of the procedure only.  This will define the
        Gateway node in the load host's DECnet database but leave the Gateway's
        DECnet and SNA configuration files unchanged.

        DECnet SNA Gateway-CT V2.1
        Installation Verification Procedure.

        The IVP checks that the directory SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV] was
        successfully created, that all Gateway-CT files have been correctly
        installed from the kit, that NETPROXY.DAT and RIGHTSLIST.DAT exist,
        and that the username SNA$CSV was correctly set up.

           17 No more input is required. If you pressed <Return> in
              response to the prompt at 16, previous file versions
              are now purged.

              If the installation procedure is successful, the
              executable files are moved to their target directory.

           18 If you pressed <Return> in response to the prompt at
              15, the installation procedure now calls the IVP to
              verify that the Gateway-CT software was successfully
              installed.

              If the installation procedure or IVP fails for any
              reason, the following message is displayed:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, the installation of SNACSA V2.1
                                    has failed.

              Errors can result if any of the following conditions
              are true:

              o  The VMS operating system version is not V5.4

              o  The Product Authorization Key was not registered and
                 loaded

              o  Disk quotas are insufficient

              o  Process quotas are incorrect

              The OpenVMS System Manager's Manual explains error
              messages generated by these conditions.

              If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
              you should take the action described in the message.
              You might need to change a system parameter, increase
              an authorized quota value, or register and load the
              PAK.

              If an IVP failure causes the installation to fail,
              contact Digital Customer Service.

           19 When the installation procedure is complete, you
              can continue to install more products or end the
              installation procedure. To end the procedure, press
              <Ctrl/Z> or <Return>.

              20 VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process
                 symbol tables during the installation. Therefore, if
                 you are going to continue using the system manager's
                 account and want to restore those symbols, you should
                 log out and log in again.

                                              Configuring the Gateway-CT



              This chapter explains how to configure the Gateway-CT
              software. Make sure you complete the Gateway-CT Configuration
              Worksheet (see Preparing for the Configuration in Chapter
              1) before you begin.

              After you install the Gateway-CT software on the load
              host, you configure the Gateway-CT system by running
              SNACSA$CONFIGURE.COM. This command procedure helps you
              with the initial configuration by defining the Gateway
              node in the load host's DECnet database and by creating
              command files that configure the SNA and the DECnet
              databases in the Gateway. The configuration should take no
              longer than 15 minutes, excluding preparation time.

              The following illustration shows how to use the informa-
              tion in this chapter:

              Default answers appear in brackets throughout the
              procedure. Press <Return> to accept the default.

     $ @SYS$MANAGER:SNACSA$CONFIGURE  <Return>

          CONFIGURE V2.1
          DECnet SNA Gateway-CT configuration procedure.

         Configuration is divided into three parts:

          .     Part 1: Define the Gateway node in the load host's
                        DECnet database.

          .     Part 2: Create a command file that will be used to
                        configure the SNA database in the Gateway
                        each time it is loaded.

          .     Part 3: Create a command file that will be used to
                        configure the DECnet database in the Gateway
                        each time it is loaded.

         This configuration procedure prompts you to see if you want
         to run each of the three parts.  All parts must be completed
         before the Gateway can be loaded. Enter "?" at any time for
         help.

     Device and directory for dump file [SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]] :  5
     Host's Ethernet circuit name (circuit-id) [BNA-0] :  6

            All questions for this section have been answered.








     3-2 Configuring the Gateway-CT

 






              1  Enter the Gateway node name (1 to 6 alphanumeric
                 characters) and press <Return>. The name must be unique
                 within the DECnet network.

              2  If you press <Return> to accept the default, the system
                 prompts you for the information that follows.

                 If the Gateway node, the SNAINI object, and the proxy
                 login information have already been defined on the
                 load host and no changes need to be made, enter N and
                 press <Return>. The system will skip to Part 2 of the
                 configuration procedure.

              3  If this node was already defined, the previous
                 definition appears as the default. Press <Return> to
                 accept the default.

                 If this is a new configuration or you if want to change
                 the default address, enter a unique DECnet node address
                 in the format [aa.]nnnn and press <Return>. Your
                 network manager can assign such a unique address.

              4  Enter the Ethernet hardware address of the Ethernet
                 port for the Gateway node (either 12 hexadecimal
                 digits or six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated
                 by hyphens) and press <Return>.

                 If this node has already been defined, the previous
                 definition appears as the default. Press <Return>
                 to accept the default. If this is a new node or if
                 the Ethernet controller in the node has been changed,
                 enter the new Ethernet hardware address and then press
                 <Return>.

              5  Specify the device and directory on the load host where
                 the dump file is written if the Gateway node performs
                 an up-line dump and press <Return>. The dump file
                 is not created until it is required. The device you
                 specify must have enough free space for the dump file.
                 If fewer than 8192 blocks are available, a warning
                 message is issued.

                 The default is SYS$COMMON:[SNA$CSV]. Press <Return> to
                 accept the default.

           6  Enter the name of the Ethernet circuit (in the format
              dev-c) that connects the load host to the Gateway-CT
              and press <Return>. The Gateway node makes service
              requests for loading and dumping on this circuit.

              If the name has already been defined, the previous
              definition appears as the default. Press <Return> to
              accept the default.





































     3-4 Configuring the Gateway-CT

 






               The following NCP commands will be used to define the Gateway
               node and SNAINI object in the load host's DECnet database.
               In addition, a proxy login will be established for the Gateway
               initialization process.  7

           7  SNACSA$CONFIGURE creates and displays the
              DEFINE_gateway-node-name_ON_load-host-node.COM
              command procedure, which contains NCP commands that
              define the Gateway node and SNAINI object in the load
              host's DECnet database. When executed, the commands in
              the file perform the following functions:

              o  Remove existing definitions, if any, of the Gateway
                 node and SNAINI in both the permanent and volatile
                 databases.

              o  Define the SNAINI object.

              o  Define the Gateway node using the name, addresses,
                 circuit, and files you specified.

              o  Enable the load host to accept incoming connections
                 via proxy accounts.

              o  Enable the circuit you specified as a service
                 circuit (for loading the Gateway software).

              o  Set the above SNAINI, Gateway node, and circuit
                 definitions in the volatile database.

           8  If you are satisfied with the answers you gave to
              the five prompts at the beginning of Part 1 (Gateway
              node name, DECnet address, hardware address, Ethernet
              circuit-id, and dump file location), press <Return>.
              The following occurs:

              o  A proxy account is created on the load host for the
                 Gateway node account. A message appears indicating
                 this.

              o  The command procedure is run, executing the NCP
                 commands. The command procedure displays as it runs.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              9  You have to manually issue the NCP command to enable
                 service functions on the load host's Ethernet circuit.
                 Before you enable the circuit for service, turn the
                 circuit off with a SET CIRCUIT STATE OFF command. Make
                 a note to execute this command, substituting your load
                 host's circuit-id (BNA-0 in the example) for dev-c,
                 after you finish running the configuration procedure.

              11 If you press <Return> to accept the default Y, you are
                 prompted to define line information.

                 If you answer N and press <Return>, the configuration
                 process proceeds to Part 3.

              12 Enter the number of circuits to be configured for the
                 line and press <Return>. Each circuit corresponds to a
                 channel address on the line; specify the same number of
                 circuits as there are channel addresses defined on the
                 IBM side for this line. Press <Return> to accept the
                 default 1.

              13 Enter the type of channel used (byte multiplexer, block
                 multiplexer, or selector) and press <Return>. Ask your
                 IBM system programmer for the channel type. The default
                 is block multiplexer.

                 The following prompt appears only if you specified a
                 byte multiplexer channel:

                 Enable forced-burst operation? (Y/N) [N] :

                 You can specify whether the line will operate in
                 forced-burst mode or not. Enter Y and press <Return> to
                 enable forced-burst mode or press <Return> to accept
                 the default and disable forced-burst mode.

              14 Enter the maximum size of buffers used to receive RUs
                 transmitted by the IBM host and press <Return>. To
                 determine the buffer size, add 9 bytes to the maximum
                 RU size. The default is 8201, which allows RUs up to
                 8192 bytes. You should set the line buffer size to be
                 large enough to accept the largest RU (plus 9 bytes)
                 that will be sent by the IBM host.

              15 Enter the channel address of the Gateway-CT as three
                 hexadecimal digits and press <Return>. Ask your IBM
                 system programmer for the channel address. There is no
                 default channel address.

              16 The LU list specifies the logical units (LUs) that
                 are defined for the PU. Enter the LUs as a list of
                 decimal number ranges and press <Return>. DECnet SNA
                 access routines can use only those LUs defined in the
                 list. Any request for communication with an LU not in
                 the list will be rejected. Also, the LUs listed must

           17 Access names are a convenient way to pass session-type
              information when an LU-LU session is being established.
              DECnet SNA Gateway-CT and Gateway-ST Management
              explains how to use access names. If you know what
              access names your site will use, you can define them
              now. You can define them at a later time by editing the
              configuration command procedure created in Part 2.

              When you are finished defining access names (or if you
              do not wish to define any at this time), press <Return>
              at the access name prompt. The configuration procedure
              then proceeds to Part 3.

           18 Enter the access name (1-16 alphanumeric characters)
              and press <Return>.

           19 Enter the name of the IBM application for the access
              name
              (1-8 alphanumeric characters) and press <Return>.
              Sessions established with this access name connect to
              the designated IBM application. If you need to specify
              this parameter, ask your IBM system programmer for the
              name.

           20 Enter an IBM ACF/VTAM Logon Mode Table entry (1-8
              alphanumeric characters) to use at the start of each
              session and press <Return>. This entry can specify
              the protocol rules for the session. If you specify no
              logon mode name, the default entry for the LU address
              as defined on the IBM system is used. The name should
              correspond with the operand label of an IBM ACF/VTAM
              MODEENT macro.

           21 Enter the optional string of user data (1-32 char-
              acters), which are passed to the session partner and
              press <Return>. The format of the data is specific to
              the IBM application acting as the session partner.
              Check with your IBM systems programmer for the
              requirements of this field.

           22 You are prompted for one or more PU/LU pairs. Press
              <Return> when you have no more to enter. The PU name

                 specifies the PU used to access the IBM system. Enter
                 the PU in the format SNA-n.

                 You can define more than one PU per access name. You
                 will be prompted for further PU/LU pairs until you
                 press <Return> in response to the PU name prompt. You
                 must enter at least one PU per access name.

              23 The LU list identifies which LUs, for a given PU, can
                 use this access name. Enter a list of numbers and/or
                 number ranges separated by commas and press <Return>.

              26 The configuration procedure also defines all parameters
                 for the DHCF server except for the LU list information.
                 The configuration procedure will prompt you for this
                 optional DHCF information.

                 Enter a list of LUs to be allocated to the DHCF server,
                 for example, 31, 32, 21-23, and then press <Return>.

                 Press <Return> if you do not wish to define any LU for

           29 Press <Return> to accept the default Y if you want the
              system to create the command file that configures the
              DECnet database in the Gateway.

              Enter N and press <Return> if you do not want the
              system to create this file.

           30 Enter the privileged username (1-16 alphanumeric
              characters) and press <Return>.

           31 Enter the privileged password (1-16 alphanumeric
              characters) and press <Return>.

              The privileged user name and password control access to
              the following Gateway functions:

              o  NCP CLEAR, LOOP, SET, and ZERO commands

              o  SNANCP CLEAR, LOOP, SET, SHOW LU (for authorization
                 information), and ZERO commands

              o  SNATRACE commands

              o  NETTRACE commands

           32 Enter the password that triggers the bootstrap
              mechanism on the target node and press <Return>.

              The password can be up to 16 hexadecimal digits. For
              Ethernet circuits, the password ranges from 0 to
              FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. If you choose the default, no
              password is set.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              Digital Equipment Corporation recommends that
              you select a service password that is at least 6

               DECnet SNA Gateway-CT configuration procedure.

               Configuration is divided into three parts:

               . Part 1: Define the Gateway node in the load host's
                 DECnet database.

               . Part 2: Create a command file that will be used to
                 configure the SNA database in the Gateway
                 each time it is loaded.

               . Part 3: Create a command file that will be used to
                 configure the DECnet database in the Gateway
                 each time it is loaded.

               This configuration procedure prompts you to see if you want
               to run each of the three parts.  All parts must be completed
               before the Gateway can be loaded. Enter "?" at any time for

                                         Loading the Gateway-CT Software



              This chapter explains how to down-line load the Gateway-CT
              software from the load host into the ChannelServer
              hardware unit.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                This section deals with DECnet/VAX commands and
                examples, and these may be different for DECnet
                /OSI. See Section 3.1 and Section 4.3 for complete
                examples of a configuration and loading of the
                software on a DECnet/OSI system. Also, refer to
                the DECnet/OSI NCL Reference Manual for information
                on NCL commands.

                _____________________________________________________

              After you complete the installation (see Chapter 2)
              and configuration (see Chapter 3), load the Gateway-CT
              software into the ChannelServer by doing one of the
              following:

              o  For the initial software load, plug in and power up the
                 ChannelServer. As part of its power-up sequence, the
                 hardware unit requests a software load from the load
                 host.

              o  For subsequent software loads, issue an NCP TRIGGER or
                 remote console BOOT command on the load host. (Ensure
                 that the ChannelServer is powered up.)

              Loading should take about 3 minutes, but could vary
              according to the type of CPU and disks on the load host,
              the amount of other work the load host is processing, and
              the volume of traffic on the local area network (LAN).

     4.1 Before Loading the Software

           Before you load the Gateway-CT software, do the following:

           o  Register and Load the PAK.
              Refer to Chapter 1 for instructions on registering and
              loading the Product Authorization Key.

           o  Install the Gateway-CT V2.1 software.
              Chapter 2 explains how to install Gateway-CT V2.1.

           o  Configure the Gateway-CT system.
              Chapter 3 explains how to configure the Gateway-CT.

           o  Inspect the Ethernet cable to the load host.
              Check that the cable is connected.

           o  Verify that the load host's Ethernet line and the
              circuit are set properly.
              Enter the following NCP commands to check the state and
              characteristics of the load host's Ethernet line and
              circuit (over which the software will be loaded):

              NCP>SHOW LINE line-id CHARACTERISTICS
              NCP>SHOW CIRCUIT circuit-id CHARACTERISTICS

              where line-id is the device name of the Ethernet line
              and circuit-id is the device name of the Ethernet
              circuit. The parameters for the line and circuit you
              specify will be displayed.

              Table 4-1 shows the default values for several
              parameters.

                 If the parameters for your line and circuit do not
                 correspond to the values shown, use the appropriate NCP
                 commands to change these values:

                 -  The line and circuit must both be ON. If they are
                    not, use the NCP SET LINE and SET CIRCUIT commands
                    to set them to the ON state.

                 -  The service timer must be set to a value that is
                    large enough to allow the software to load. The
                    service timer sets the maximum time that will
                    elapse during service for the Gateway-CT before
                    a retransmission is necessary. The default (4000 ms)
                    should be sufficient; if it is not, use the NCP SET
                    LINE SERVICE TIMER command to change this value.

                 -  The service on the circuit must be ENABLED. If it
                    is not, use the NCP SET CIRCUIT SERVICE command to
                    enable service on the circuit.

              o  Verify that the ChannelServer installation has been
                 completed.
                 See the DEC ChannelServer II Installation or the
                 DEC ChannelServer Hardware Installation Guide for
                 details.

              o  Enable event logging at the DECnet load host.
                 Event logging records all system and network events or
                 errors and is used to diagnose problems that can occur
                 with the Gateway-CT. Use the NCP SET LOGGING command
                 to enable event logging. The OpenVMS System Manager's
                 Manual provides additional information about DECnet
                 event logging.

              o  Enable DECnet event logging on the DECnet load host.
                 If you enable event logging at a terminal connected to
                 the load host, you will receive a log of the events
                 that occur during loading. You can examine this
                 log to verify that the Gateway-CT software loaded

              successfully. If a problem appears while you are
              loading the software, you can examine the event log
              to determine the cause.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              To enable logging at a terminal connected to the
              load host, you need OPER privilege.

              _____________________________________________________

              Issue the following DCL command from the terminal on
              which you want to receive the event messages:

              $ REPLY/ENABLE=NETWORK

              To ensure that SNA event logging is active, use the DCL
              SHOW SYSTEM command. You should see a process called
              SNAEVL.

     4.2 Loading the Software on DECnet/VAX

           You use the NCP TRIGGER command to start loading the
           Gateway-CT software.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              If you use the NCP LOAD command, a communications
              error between the load host and the Gateway-CT will
              result. Use the NCP TRIGGER command instead.

              _____________________________________________________

           If your terminal is logged into the load host, issue the
           NCP TRIGGER NODE command using the following format:

           NCP>TRIGGER NODE node-id

           where node-id identifies the name of the Gateway node.
           If a service password was defined for the Gateway node,
           include the password in the NCP TRIGGER command.

           For example:

           NCP>TRIGGER NODE STAR SERVICE PASSWORD 1E3C41EAB32D3BCD

     4-4 Loading the Gateway-CT Software

 






              The NCP TRIGGER command sets off a bootstrap mechanism in
              the ChannelServer which causes the unit to send a request-
              to-load
              message to all hosts on the Ethernet LAN. Gateway load
              hosts are configured to receive the message. The first
              load host that responds to the request-to-load message
              loads the Gateway-CT software into the Gateway node.

              If no errors occur during loading, the event-logging
              terminal displays the following event messages; the exact
              messages and sequence might vary:

           If errors occur during loading, the event-logging terminal
           displays any errors which were detected during loading and
           initialization. DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport
           and Gateway for Synchronous Transport Management lists
           the SNANCP error messages and explains how to recover from
           them.

           If any errors occur when the configuration file loads,
           the errors are reported to the event log. DECnet SNA
           Gateway for Channel Transport and Gateway for Synchronous
           Transport Management lists and explains all initialization
           messages generated by the Gateway-CT software.

           If you issue an NCP TRIGGER command from any node on
           the Ethernet LAN and the Gateway node fails to start,
           you might try starting the load at the hardware unit.
           DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transpfort Problem Solving
           (OpenVMS and ULTRIX) should help you find the source of a
           failure.

     4.4 Checking the Connection Between the Gateway Node and the
         Load Host

           After the Gateway-CT software loads, check the connection
           between the Gateway node and the load host. After the
           Gateway node starts up, verify that the link from the load
           host to the DECnet node is working properly, as follows:

           o  Ensure that the load host can communicate with the
              Gateway node; issue the NCP command SET EXECUTOR NODE
              with the Gateway node as the node name. If you receive
              an error message after entering this command, refer

                 to DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport Problem
                 Solving (OpenVMS and ULTRIX) for help.

              o  Check the results of the NCP SET EXECUTOR NODE command;
                 issue the following command:

                 NCP>SHOW EXECUTOR STATUS

                 If you receive an error message after this command,
                 see DECnet SNA Gateway-CT Problem Solving (OpenVMS
                 and ULTRIX). Also, check the event log for a message
                 showing circuit activity with the DECnet node since the
                 Gateway-CT was booted.
