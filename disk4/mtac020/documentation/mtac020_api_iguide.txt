     Installation Prerequisites

           Before you install the MAILbus 400[TM] API, you should:

           o  Ensure the following software is installed on your
              system:

              -  OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] Version 6.1, or later, or
                 OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0, or later.

              -  DECnet[TM]/OSI[R] for OpenVMS VAX, Version 6.3, or
                 later, or DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0, or
                 later.

           o  Ensure you have access to the SYSTEM account.

           o  Ensure no one is using the system where you install the
              API.

           o  Back up your system disk using the OpenVMS Backup
              utility.

           o  Register a valid API license, MAILBUS-400-API. Use the
              OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF) to do this.
              You cannot install the MAILbus 400 API unless you have
              registered a valid license.

           o  You can modify the software on your VAX or MicroVAX[TM]
              system with the VMSTAILOR utility. Ensure that you do
              not remove the Object and Shareable Image libraries
              software; this is required by the MAILbus 400 API.

           o  Stop any MAILbus 400 API applications that are running
              on your system.

           For more information about the OpenVMS Backup utility,
           VMSTAILOR, and the OpenVMS License Management Facility,
           see the OpenVMS system management documentation.

     Information Required

           To install the MAILbus 400 API, you need to know the name
           of the device from which the installation kit will be
           loaded.

        Time Required

              The time it takes to install the MAILbus 400 API
              depends on the resources available on your system.
              The installation takes approximately 5 minutes on a
              VAXstation[TM] 3500.

        Disk Space Required

              The MAILbus 400 API requires approximately 3200 blocks of
              free disk space during installation, and 2900 blocks on
              the SYSTEM disk after installation.

        Installing the MAILbus 400 API

              From the SYSTEM account on the node, or cluster, where you
              want to install the MAILbus 400 API, type:

              @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL MTA020 device OPTIONS N

              where device is the name of the device where the
              distribution medium is to be mounted, for example MUA0, or
              a device and directory where the product is available.

              The installation procedure starts and prompts you to enter
              the components that you want to install. Select both the
              MAILbus 400 API and the MAILbus 400 MTA Base component.

        After the Installation

              Depending on the subsets you have installed, the MAILbus
              400 API installation might have superseded the files
              MTA$CLIENT_STARTUP.COM and
              MTA$CREATE_CLIENT_CLNS_TEMPLATE.NCL. Check if this has
              occurred, and if so, apply any of your customizations to
              the new versions of these files.
