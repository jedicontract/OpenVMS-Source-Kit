        1.1 Introducing the Gateway

              The Message Router VMSmail Gateway is part of MAILbus.
              MAILbus comprises Message Router and its Gateways, of
              which the VMSmail Gateway is one. The Message Router
              VMSmail Gateway Kit contains the Message Router VMSmail
              Gateway and Message Router.

              The Gateway allows you to exchange mail between VMSmail
              and a Message Router system. Using the Gateway, a VMSmail
              user and a user of a Message Router based mail system can
              send mail to each other.

              VMSmail users can also use the Gateway when exchanging
              mail with each other. This enables them to take advantage
              of Message Router's store-and-forward capability, which is
              useful if a node is not operating.

        1.2 Installing and Configuring

              You must install Message Router Version 3.5 before you
              install the Gateway. You cannot use the Gateway until
              you have first installed and then configured it. You must
              configure Message Router before you configure the Gateway.

              You do not have to configure the Gateway immediately after
              installing it. If you have other MAILbus components that
              you want to install, such as other Gateways, you can
              install these first and configure all the components,
              including Message Router, together. However, there is one
              exception to this: the Message Router X.400 Gateway (MRX)
              needs Message Router to be configured before it can be
              installed.


                                                        Introduction 1-1

 






           Before starting the installation procedure, you must use
           the VMS License Management Utility to register and load
           the Product Authorization Key (PAK) for the Gateway,
           MR-VMSMAIL-GATEWAY. If you install the Gateway without
           first loading and registering its PAK, the installation
           verification procedure fails. Refer to the VMS License
           Management Utility Manual for information on how to use
           the VMS License Management Utility.

     1.2.1 The Installation Procedure

           This guide explains how to install the Message Router
           VMSmail Gateway on an OpenVMS operating system using
           VMSINSTAL. VMSINSTAL is a command procedure used to
           install optional software products on an OpenVMS operating
           system. Basic knowledge of VMSINSTAL is required to
           perform the installation. This procedure is interactive
           and takes you through the installation step by step. Each
           step is described fully in Chapter 3.

           You can check that the installation has succeeded by
           running the installation verification procedure (IVP)
           after the installation is complete. The IVP, if you
           request it, runs automatically after the installation,
           and is described fully in Chapter 3. If the IVP runs
           successfully, the Gateway software resides on your system,
           but cannot be used until it is configured.

           Installing the Gateway and running the IVP should take
           about 15 minutes, depending on the system configuration
           and type of media used. The installation procedure is the
           same, regardless of the distribution media.

           The installation procedure varies slightly, according
           to whether you are performing a new or an upgrade
           installation. The differences are fully described in
           Chapter 2.

           Prepare your system for installation by following the
           instructions in Chapter 2.





     1-2 Introduction

 






        1.2.2 The Configuration Procedure

              After installing the Gateway, configure it as described in
              the VAX Message Router VMSmail Gateway Management Guide.
              You will not be able to use the Gateway until it has been
              configured.

              The configuration procedure allows you to customize the
              Gateway to meet the requirements of your system.

        1.3 Handling Installation Errors

              It is a good idea to take a log of the installation
              procedure to keep a record of any errors. If you receive
              an unexpected error message during installation, do the
              following:

              1. Check that you have responded to the prompts correctly

              2. If you have made a mistake and are re-prompted, enter
                 the correct information

              3. If re-entering the information fails, restart the
                 installation

              4. If the installation fails again at the same point,
                 contact Digital as follows:

                 o  Contact your Customer Support Center, if you have a
                    service contract

                 o  Contact your local Digital office to arrange for a
                    service contract, if you do not have one

              Turn to Chapter 2 to prepare for installation.

                                        Preparing to Install the Gateway



        2.1 Preparation Checklist

              Complete the steps in the following checklist to
              prepare your OpenVMS VAX system for the new or upgrade
              installation:

              1. Ensure that your Gateway distribution kit contains
                 everything listed on the bill of materials, which is
                 included with the kit.

                 The distribution medium may be a magnetic tape or
                 disk(s), or an optical disk, containing all the files
                 listed in Appendix A. The type of media depends on your
                 system hardware.

              2. Ensure that your system has the prerequisite software
                 and hardware. See Section 2.2.

              3. Ensure that the SYSTEM account is setup with sufficient
                 quota. See Section 2.3.

              4. Ensure that the Product Authorization Key (PAK) for
                 your Gateway is registered and active. See Section 2.3.

              5. Prepare the system for installation. See Section 2.3.

              6. Make sure Message Router Version 3.5 that has been
                 successfully installed on your system. You can do this
                 by running the Message Router IVP during the Message
                 Router installation. You do not have to configure
                 Message Router Version 3.5 before installing the
                 Gateway.

                 If you run the Gateway IVP during the Gateway
                 installation, Message Router is set running on the
                 node where you are installing the Gateway. Message
                 Router and the Gateway are shut down after the Gateway
                 IVP has been run.

     2.2 Prerequisite Software and Hardware

           To install the Message Router VMSmail Gateway Version 3.5,
           you must have:

           o  Version 5.5-2, 6.2 and 7.1 Year 2000 ECO patches
              installed

           o  Message Router Version 3.5 installed.

           o  OpenVMS[TM] for VAX[TM] Version 5.5-2, Version 6.2, or
              Version 7.1

           o  OpenVMS[TM]/VAX Version 5.5-2 either DECnet VAX Version
              5.5-2 or DECnet/OSI [R] Version 5.6B.

           o  OpenVMS[TM]/VAX Version 6.2 either DECnet VAX Version
              6.2 or DECnet/OSI [R] Version 6.3.

           o  OpenVMS[TM]/VAX Version 7.1 either DECnet VAX or DECnet
              /OSI [R] Version 7.1.

           o  You need a valid license (MR-VMSMAIL-GATEWAY) to use
              V3.5 of the Gateway.

              The Gateway runs on either Phase IV DECnet or DECnet
              /OSI for OpenVMS. If the Gateway is running on DECnet
              /OSI, there are some restrictions to how messages can
              be addressed. See Section 6.2 in the Release Notes
              for Message Router VMSmail Gateway V3.5 for details of
              these restrictions in addressing.

              It is not supported to run V3.5 of the Gateway on a
              VAXcluster[TM] that is running a mixture of DECnet/VAX
              Phase IV and DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX.

           o  A valid VAX or MicroVAX system configuration.

              Note that you cannot use node names longer than six
              characters with the Message Router VMSmail Gateway.
              Therefore, on DECnet/OSI systems, the node name synonym
              database must be accessible on the node where the
              Message Router VMSmail Gateway is installed.

           o  Optional: DECwindows MOTIF installed (required for the
              support of CDA documents).

           o  A minimum of 5000 free blocks on the system disk
              available for installation and 700 free blocks
              available after installation.

     2-2 Preparing to Install the Gateway

 






              o  About 6000 free blocks on the target disk. This is the
                 disk where the Gateway directory is to be created.

        2.2.1 Tailoring OpenVMS

              You must check that appropriate OpenVMS software is
              available on your system. Do this using the OpenVMS
              Tailoring utility. The tailoring utility enables you to
              add and remove software from the OpenVMS Version 5.5-
              2 system. You can use the OpenVMS Tailoring utility on
              any VAX system, but you are more likely to need it on a
              MicroVAX.

              Message Router Version 3.5 requires the following classes
              of OpenVMS files:

              o  OpenVMS Required Saveset

              o  Network Support

              o  Programming Support

              o  Secure User's Environment

              o  Utilities

              If any of these classes are missing, use the OpenVMS
              Tailoring utility (VMSTAILOR) to install them. Refer
              to OpenVMS Version 5.5 Upgrade and Installation Manual
              for details of VMSTAILOR. When you have completed these
              preparations, go to Section 2.3.

        2.3 Preparing Your System for Installation

              Before installation, ensure you are logged on to the
              SYSTEM, or suitably privileged, account.

              To install the Gateway, use VMSINSTAL. Before invoking
              VMSINSTAL, prepare your system, as follows:

              1. Check that the Gateway PAK is registered and active, by
                 typing the following command:

                 $ LICENSE LIST MR-VMSMAIL-GATEWAY /FULL

                 The license for your Gateway should be displayed. If it
                 is not displayed, you need to register and load your
                 Gateway PAK. For details of how to do this, see the VMS
                 License Management Utility Manual.

                                    Preparing to Install the Gateway 2-3

 






           2. If you have not already done so, check that there
              are no active users on the system using the following
              command:

              $ SHOW USERS

              The system lists the active users currently on the
              system.

              If there are any users active on the system, ask them
              to log out by typing:

              $ REPLY /BELL /USERNAME "PLEASE LOG OUT"

           3. You may want to keep a log of the installation
              procedure. You can do this either by using the
              operator's console, which is usually a hardcopy
              terminal, or by keeping a log, as follows:

              $ SET HOST 0 /LOG=filename

              where filename is the name of the file that is to
              contain the installation log.

           4. Backup your system disk.

              If a system failure occurs at a critical point during
              the installation, some files can be corrupted. Also,
              you are given the choice of purging old files during
              the installation.

           5. Ensure that there are at least 5000 blocks available on
              the system disk for the installation of the Gateway.
              After installation, the Gateway needs at least 700
              blocks on the system disk and about 6000 blocks on
              the target disk. Of this 6000 blocks on the target
              disk, the installed Gateway software uses 1800 blocks.
              The remaining 4200 blocks are used to hold messages,
              database and queue files.

           6. You must ensure that the SYSTEM account is set up with
              sufficient quota. The quotas that you set to install
              and run Message Router are sufficient to install and
              run the Gateway.

           7. The Gateway requires the following minimum free global
              pages and global sections:

                 100 GBLPAGES available
                   2 GBLSECTIONS available

     2-4 Preparing to Install the Gateway

 






                 Use the following commands to find the number of
                 available global pages and global sections:

                 $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")
                 $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")

                 If necessary, make incremental changes to the parameter
                 values. Edit the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT to
                 include the following lines:

                 ADD_GBLPAGES=100
                 ADD_GBLSECTIONS=2

              8. You must ensure that the account that VMSmail uses is
                 set up with sufficient quota. By default, VMSmail uses
                 the MAIL$SERVER account.

                 Set FILLM for the account that VMSmail uses to at least
                 20.

                 Set BYTLM for the account to 512 multiplied by FILLM.

                 To set the quota for these parameters, use the
                 Authorize utility as follows:

                 a. Invoke the Authorize utility:

                    $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE

                 b. Modify the FILLM quota:

                    UAF> MODIFY accountname /FILLM=quota1

                    where:

                    o  accountname is the name of the account that
                       VMSmail uses

                    o  quota1 is the quota you want to specify for
                       FILLM, and should be at least 20

                 c. Modify the BYTLM quota:

                    UAF> MODIFY accountname /BYTLM=quota2

                    where:

                    o  accountname is the name of the account that
                       VMSmail uses

                    o  quota2 is 512 multiplied by the quota1 you
                       specified for FILLM

                                    Preparing to Install the Gateway 2-5

 






              d. Exit from the Authorize utility:

                 UAF> EXIT

              If these quotas for the account that VMSmail uses
              are not set sufficiently high, a message sent to
              many recipients on many nodes might not be delivered
              efficiently.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              During the configuration procedure, you can specify
              the number of nodes that the Gateway can connect
              to at one time. The default is 5 nodes. You must
              set the FILLM quota for the account that VMSmail
              uses to the number of nodes that can be connected to
              at any one time, plus 4. If you choose to increase
              the number of nodes during the configuration, you
              will need to modify the FILLM and BYTLM quotas
              accordingly.

              _____________________________________________________

           9. Check that VMSmail is working by sending a mail message
              to 0::SYSTEM. If the message arrives at the SYSTEM
              account, VMSmail is working.

           10.If Message Router Version 3.5 is running on your
              system, you must stop it and all MAILbus components
              as follows:

              $ @SYS$MANAGER:MB$CONTROL STOP=(ER,...,TS,DDS,MS)

              where . . . is a list of the identifiers of other
              MAILbus components that are installed on your system.
              If this is not a new installation, include MRG in this
              command.

              You must use this command on every node in a VAXcluster[TM].

           If you are upgrading the Gateway from Version 3.2, or
           reinstalling Version 3.3 of the Gateway, complete the
           further preparations described in Section 2.4.

           If you are installing the Gateway on a VAXcluster or
           Local Area VAXcluster, complete the further preparations
           described in Section 2.5.

              Otherwise, turn to the next chapter to install the
              Gateway.

        2.4 Further Preparations for an Upgrade Installation or a
            Reinstallation

              Customers who have Message Router VMSmail Gateway V3.2
              or later can upgrade to V3.5 directly. Customers who have
              earlier Versions need to install atleast V3.2 and then
              upgrade to V3.5.

              When you install V3.5 of the Gateway, VMSINSTAL asks you
              whether you have a Product Authorization Key (PAK) for
              V3.5. Answer YES if you have a License PAK for V3.2 or
              V3.3 of the Gateway, because V3.5 uses the same PAK as
              V3.2 and V3.3. If you have a License PAK for V3.2 or V3.3
              of the Gateway, you do not need a new PAK for V3.5 of the
              Gateway.

              However, if you have a Nonlicense PAK for V3.2 or V3.3
              of the Gateway, you must update the PAK to allow you
              to run V3.5 of the Gateway. If you are not sure whether
              you have a License PAK or Nonlicense PAK, examine the
              Authorization Number data field on the PAK. If the second
              and third characters correspond to the list below, you
              have a Nonlicense PAK:

                 FT, IM, QM, RE, SI, SP, TC, TP, TS, WS

              In addition to the above list, a PAK that has the letters
              CS as the second and third characters is not valid unless
              it was generated by ALL-IN-1[TM] IOS or MailWorks[TM].

              Prepare your system for installation as follows:

              1. If you are upgrading the Gateway from Version 3.2, you
                 must remove MRTOVMS from the batch queue.

                 During the installation procedure, you are asked if
                 you want to purge files replaced by this installation.
                 If you are reinstalling Version 3.3 of the Gateway and
                 purge your files, as recommended, you must also remove
                 MRTOVMS from the batch queue.

                 To remove MRTOVMS from the batch queue, log in to the
                 SYSTEM account, and type:

                 $ SHOW QUEUE queuename /ALL

                                    Preparing to Install the Gateway 2-7

 






              where queuename is the name of the batch queue MRTOVMS
              is running on. The default queue name is MB$BATCH.

              This command shows the list of jobs queued to run on
              the batch queue.

              Examine the queue for the MRTOVMS entry and make a note
              of the entry number. Delete this entry from the queue
              by typing:

              $ DELETE /ENTRY=entrynumber queuename

              where entrynumber is the entry number noted above and
              queuename is the name of the queue.

           2. If you configured the Gateway to run with exception
              reporting, you must also delete MB$MRG from the batch
              queue. Do this in the same way as you deleted MRTOVMS
              from the batch queue.

              If either of these two entries are in the batch queue,
              the old batch jobs will fail if you select the purge
              option during the installation procedure.

           3. If you are installing the Gateway on a VAXcluster
              or Local Area VAXcluster, complete the further
              preparations described in Section 2.5. Otherwise, turn
              to Chapter 3 to install the Gateway.

     2.5 Preparing to Install the Gateway on a VAXcluster or Local
         Area VAXcluster

           You can run the Gateway on any OpenVMS VAXcluster or
           Local Area VAXcluster configuration. For each Gateway
           in the cluster, you need to register and load your Gateway
           Product Authorization Key (PAK), using the VMS License
           Management Utility. The VMS License Management Utility
           Manual describes how to register and load your PAK.

           In a VAXcluster, all the nodes may share a single
           SYSUAF.DAT file and DECnet database or one group of nodes
           may share one set of resources, and another group may
           share a different set of resources. Also, in a cluster,
           there may be a single system disk or multiple system
           disks.

     2-8 Preparing to Install the Gateway

 






              Irrespective of how your cluster is defined, there must
              be only one Message Router VMSmail Gateway environment
              within the cluster. However, the Gateway does not need to
              be installed and configured on all nodes in a cluster.

              Choose the set of nodes that you want the Message Router
              VMSmail Gateway to run on, and make sure you install it
              such that the installation satisfies the following two
              constraints:

              o  It modifies all the SYSUAF.DAT files and DECnet
                 databases that are shared by those nodes

              o  It modifies all the system disks that are used by those
                 nodes

              To satisfy both of these constraints, you may need to
              perform more than one installation. However, all the
              installations of the Gateway on a cluster must use the
              same Message Router VMSmail Gateway environment, that
              is, the same MB$ directory structure and associated data
              files.

              When you have installed the Gateway, you must configure
              it. As part of configuration you can choose whether to
              enable the use of the cluster alias, if one is defined.
              You can also choose to start a minimum set of Message
              Router VMSmail Gateway processes on some of the nodes in
              the cluster. (See the VAX Message Router VMSmail Gateway
              Management Guide.)

              Turn to Chapter 3 to install the Gateway.

                                                  Installing the Gateway



              This chapter explains how to install the Gateway.

        3.1 Overview of VMSINSTAL

              VMSINSTAL is a procedure that can be used to install
              optional software products on the OpenVMS operating
              system. VMSINSTAL requires at least two parameters:

              o  The name of the product(s) being installed

              o  The name of the device where the distribution medium is
                 mounted or loaded

        3.2 Installation Procedure

              If possible, use a hardcopy terminal when performing the
              installation, to preserve a record of the procedure in
              case of failure.

              Remember that you can call on-line help by typing a
              question mark (?) in response to any prompt.

              Complete the following steps:

              1. Log in to the SYSTEM account, and type the following
                 command:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL MRGATE035 device OPTIONS N

                 where:

                 o  MRGATE035 is the identity of the product being
                    installed

                 o  device is the name of the device where the
                    distribution medium is to be mounted, for example,
                    MTA0

                                              Installing the Gateway 3-1

 






              o  OPTIONS N provides the option of reading or printing
                 the on-line release notes

              ________________________Note ________________________

              Do not use the VMSINSTAL alternate root option,
              OPTION R. The Message Router VMSmail Gateway does
              not support this option in VMSINSTAL.

              If this is a reinstallation of the Gateway Version
              3.5, you can omit the parameter OPTIONS N, provided
              you have already read the release notes.

              _____________________________________________________

           2. The procedure starts, and displays:

                      VAX/VMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vx.x

              It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.

              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              where dd-mmm-yyyy and hh:mm are the current date and
              time, and x.x is the OpenVMS version number.

           3. You may receive the following warning message:

              %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active.

              * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

              If you receive any warning messages, you are advised
              to exit from the installation procedure, by pressing
              RETURN, and correct the problem, as described in
              Chapter 2. Then restart the installation.

              If any processes are still active, you are advised to
              shut them down. To do this, press RETURN to accept the
              default answer of NO and to exit from the installation
              procedure. Ask users with active processes to log out,
              as described in step 2 of Section 2.3. Then restart the
              installation.

              If you want to continue the installation regardless of
              the warning messages, type YES.

     3-2 Installing the Gateway

 






              4. You may receive one or more of the following error
                 messages:

                 %VMSINSTAL-E-LOWQUOTA, The following account quotas for Message
                 Router VMSmail Gateway V3.5 are too low.
                 %VMSINSTAL-E-LOWSYSGEN, The following SYSGEN parameters for Message
                 Router VMSmail Gateway V3.5 are too low.

                 In this case, the installation will cease immediately.
                 You are not given the option to continue.

                 A list of the incorrect quotas and/or parameters is
                 displayed. You must set these quotas and/or parameters
                 to the values stated in Chapter 2.

               The installation will take approximately 15 minutes
               depending on system configuration and media type.

           17.The procedure displays a series of messages that
              tell you that the generation phase of the Gateway
              installation is proceeding. There is a pause between
              each message.

              If this is a reinstallation of Version 3.5 of the
              Gateway, or an upgrade from an earlier version, the
              procedure continues at Step 18. Otherwise, for a new
              installation, the procedure displays:

              %MRG-I-CHECDIRS, Checking Directories
              %MRGATE-I-CREMBDIR, Creating directory device:[MB$.MRG]

                 to target directories

              19.After VMSINSTAL has marked the files for moving to the
                 Gateway, more messages are displayed:

                  The generation phase of the Message Router VMSmail Gateway
                  installation is now complete.

                     In order to tailor the Message Router VMSmail Gateway to your
                     requirements, you must use the MAILbus configuration procedure,
                     SYS$MANAGER:MB$CONFIG.COM.

                 You will not have a working system until the Gateway
                 has been configured. The configuration procedure is
                 described in the VAX Message Router VMSmail Gateway
                 Management Guide. You also need to refer to the VAX
                 Message Router Configuration Guide and other gateway
                 management guides, if you want to configure all the
                 MAILbus products together.

              20.The procedure moves the Gateway files to their
                 specified directories:

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target
                 directories...

                 When this message appears, the installation is
                 completing.

     3.3 Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

           The IVP runs automatically after the installation is
           complete, if you requested it. It checks that the
           installation was successful. The following is an example
           of the Gateway installation verification procedure.

                      IVP for Message Router VMSmail Gateway

                                  Version V3.5-402

               This is the installation verification procedure (IVP) for
               the Message Router VMSmail Gateway. It checks that the Gateway is
               successfully installed on your system.

           ==================================================================

           Message Router VMSmail Gateway Version V3.5-402 IVP
           This verification procedure is in four stages:

           Stage 1 checks that all the Gateway files exist, and are the right size.

           Stage 2 sets DECnet running if necessary.

           Stage 3 tests the Gateway by sending a mail message from VMSmail to
           Message Router.  When this stage is complete, a message is displayed
           on the screen.

           Stage 4 tests the Gateway by sending a mail message from Message Router
           to VMSmail.  When this stage is complete, you will receive a mail
           message.  This message is sent to the account from which you are
           performing the verification.

           The verification procedure has not completed successfully
           until you have seen both the screen message and the mail message.

              If you performed the installation from the console medium,
              you are asked to remove the distribution volume from the
              console device and replace it with the console volume:

              Please mount the console volume on device:
              Are you ready?

              where device is the device name that you specified in Step
              1 of Section 3.2.

              When you have replaced the console volume, type YES.

           The system confirms that the console volume has been
           mounted, and then exits from VMSINSTAL:

           %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, CONSOLE mounted on _device:

                     VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

           Provided you have received the mail message from stage 4
           of the IVP, the installation was successful. You must now
           complete the installation as described in Section 3.4.

           If you do not receive the mail message from stage 4, you
           must reinstall the Gateway. If the IVP did not indicate
           the reason for the failure of the installation, you can
           set VERIFY on the installation procedure, so that the IVP
           displays more information on your screen.

           To set VERIFY on the Gateway installation procedure, use
           the following command:

           $ VFY$MRGCVP=1

           You then install the Gateway again in the usual way.

     3.4 Completing the Installation

           Following the successful completion of the installation
           and the IVP, check the location of the software (described
           in Section 3.5). You must then configure the Gateway
           as described in the VAX Message Router VMSmail Gateway
           Management Guide. If you do not configure the Gateway you
           will not be able to use it.

           If you do not want to configure the Gateway immediately,
           restart Message Router and other MAILbus products that you
           stopped, using the command:

           $ @SYS$MANAGER:MB$CONTROL START=(MS,DDS,TS,...,ER)

           You must restart MAILbus on every node in a cluster.

              Of the files shown in [MB$.MRG], only VMSERROR.DAT,
              MRTOVMS.COM, and MRTOVMS.EXE are installed during the
              installation procedure. The remaining files are created
              during the configuration or operation of the Gateway.

              If you are reinstalling or upgrading the Gateway, new ver-
              sions of
              VMSERROR.DAT, MRTOVMS.COM, and MRTOVMS.EXE are installed.
              The other files shown in [MB$.MRG] are not affected by the
              reinstallation or upgrade installation.

           During configuration, MRGINIT.DAT is recreated, with new
           configuration data, or data from the previous MRGINIT.DAT,
           depending on whether you specify that you want to keep old
           data.

           Initially, allow a disk quota of at least 5000 blocks for
           the MRGATE account. When required, the quota should be
           raised to allow for any increase in the volume of message
           traffic.

           Table 3-1 shows how the Gateway software is distributed
           after the installation. The file protection codes are the
           recommended settings that are issued in the distribution
           kit.

     B-2 Sample Installation Procedure

 






                Message Router VMSmail Gateway Version V3.5-402 IVP

        This verification procedure is in four stages:

        Stage 1 checks that all the Gateway files exist, and are the right size.

        Stage 2 sets DECnet running if necessary.

        Stage 3 tests the Gateway by sending a mail message from VMSmail to
        Message Router.  When this stage is complete, a message is displayed
        on the screen.

        Stage 4 tests the Gateway by sending a mail message from Message Router
        to VMSmail.  When this stage is complete, you will receive a mail
        message.  This message is sent to the account from which you are
        performing the verification.

        The verification procedure has not completed successfully
        until you have seen both the screen message and the mail message.
