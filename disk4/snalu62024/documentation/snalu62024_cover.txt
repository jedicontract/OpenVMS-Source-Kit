          Description

          The DIGITAL SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface for OpenVMS
          product is a layered software product that allows user-written
          applications running on suitably configured OpenVMS systems, ei-
          ther within a TCP/IP or DECnet network environment, to exchange
          messages with cooperating applications on an IBM host. Access
          between the cooperating OpenVMS and IBM applications is via one
          of the following products:

          o  DIGITAL SNA Peer Server

          o  DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway for Channel Transport

          o  DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway for Synchronous Transport

          o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

          o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

          o  DIGITAL SNA Access Server for Windows NT

          o  OpenVMS SNA

          Features

          The APPC product is a set of subroutines called by OpenVMS
          programs that act as LU6.2 transaction application programs.
          These subroutines allow a OpenVMS transaction application to:

          o  Activate and deactivate sessions

          o  Allocate and deallocate LU6.2 basic and mapped conversations

          o  Send and receive data

          o  Request confirmation and confirm transactions

          o  Send and receive error information

 






          o  Define remote LU, mode, and transaction program parameters

          o  Supply program initialization parameters

          o  Supply session-level security and conversation-level security

          o  Allocate a conversation in response to an incoming allocation
             request

          Installation

          Register and load the product's PAK using the OpenVMS License
          Management Facility before you begin installation. Refer to the
          OpenVMS License Management Utility manual for complete licensing
          information.

          To install, enter the following command:
