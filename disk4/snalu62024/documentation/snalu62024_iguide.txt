    Preparing the IBM SNA Environment

          Before you can use the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface
          Software, you must prepare certain software components in
          the IBM environment, as follows:

          o  The OpenVMS SNA Guide to IBM Parameters explains the
             IBM parameters to define for successful communication
             between the IBM host and OpenVMS SNA (OpenVMS VAX
             Version 6.2 only).

          o  The DECnet SNA Gateway-ST Guide to IBM Parameters
             explains the IBM parameters to define for successful
             communication between the IBM host and your
             DECnet SNA Gateway-ST.

          o  The DECnet SNA Gateway-CT Guide to IBM Parameters
             explains the IBM parameters to define for successful
             communication between the IBM host and your
             DECnet SNA Gateway-CT.

          o  The DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Guide to IBM Resource
             Definition explains the IBM parameters to define for
             successful communication between the IBM host and your
             DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway.

          o  The DIGITAL Peer Server Guide to IBM Resource Definition
             explains the IBM parameters to define for successful
             communication between the IBM host and your DIGITAL SNA
             Peer Server.

          o  The DIGITAL SNA Access Server for Windows NT Guide to
             IBM Resource Definition) explains the IBM parameters to
             define for successful communication between the IBM host
             and your DIGITAL SNA Access Server for Windows NT.

          You should view the Compaq documentation as an adjunct
          to the IBM documentation; the IBM documentation remains
          the authoritative source for IBM software concepts and
          procedures.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Since IBM system programmers generally reconfigure and
             generate their systems according to a set schedule,
             give them as much advance notice as possible.

          Use the SHOW SYSTEM command to determine the current
          version. If you do not have the required version, you must
          install it before you install the APPC/LU6.2 Programming
          Interface software. The OpenVMS System Manager's Manual
          explains how to install OpenVMS software.

    Verifying Necessary Privileges

          To install the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface software,
          you must be logged in to an account that has SYSPRV. Use
          the
          SHOW PROCESS/PRIVILEGES command to check privileges.

    Verifying Required Disk Space

          See Table 1-1 for the number of free blocks required on
          the system disk during and after installation. Use the
          SHOW DEVICE command to check available disk space.

          The APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface software supports
          OpenVMS tailoring for installation on systems that have
          limited system disk space. The APPC/LU6.2 Programming
          Interface Software Product Description (SPD) explains
          OpenVMS tailoring and lists the necessary OpenVMS system
          classes. The OpenVMS SPD provides more information on
          classes and OpenVMS tailoring.

    Determining Available Global Sections and Global Pages

          See Table 1-1 for the number of global sections and global
          pages required on the system. To check the number of global
          sections and global pages (pagelets) available on your
          system, type the following command at the OpenVMS prompt
          ($).

          $ INSTALL LIST/SUMMARY/GLOBAL

          The VMSINSTAL utility will display the number of global
          sections and global pages available on your system.

    Registering and Loading the Product Authorization Key

          Make sure that you have registered and loaded the Product
          Authorization Key (PAK) before your begin the installation.
          Refer to the OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual for
          this information.

        Backing Up Your System Disk

              Before you start an installation that involves writing to
              your system disk, Compaq Computer Corporation recommends
              that you make a backup copy of your system disk. The
              OpenVMS System Manager's Manual explains how to back up
              your system disk.

                 Installing the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface Software


              This chapter explains how to install the APPC/LU6.2
              Programming Interface software.

        The Installation Dialog

              The APPC software installation procedure consists of
              a series of questions and informational messages. See
              Appendix A for a sample installation.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              <Ctrl/Y>. When you press <Ctrl/Y>, the installation
              procedure deletes all the files it created up to that point
              and exits. You can then start the installation again.

              1. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name OPTIONS N

                 To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command
                 procedure from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM
                 account. VMSINSTAL is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. The
                 following list defines the parameters of the VMSINSTAL
                 command procedure.

                 saveset-name
                 The installation name for the software component. For
                 the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface software, use the
                 name SNALU62024.

                 device-name
                 The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
                 media. For example, MTA0: is the device name for a tape
                 drive. It is not necessary to use the console drive for
                 this installation. However, if you do use the console
                 drive, you should replace any media you removed once the
                 installation is complete.

             Installing the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface Software 2-1

 







             OPTIONS N
             An optional parameter that indicates you want to see the
             question about release notes. If you do not include the
             OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about
             the release notes. You should review the release notes
             before proceeding with the installation in case they
             contain additional information about the installation.
             If you are restarting the installation and have already
             reviewed the release notes, you do not need to specify
             OPTIONS N.

             Note that there are other options you can select when
             you invoke VMSINSTAL.

             o  Auto answer option (A): Initially creates a file
                that contains your answers to VMSINSTAL questions and
                prompts. You can then use the option (and the answer
                file) to save time during a reinstallation (typically
                after upgrading your system).

             o  Get save set option (G): Lets you store product save
                sets temporarily on a magnetic tape or in a disk
                directory.

             o  File log option (L): Logs all activity to the
                terminal during installation.

             o  Alternate root option (R): Lets you install the
                product on a system root other than that of the
                running system.

             See the OpenVMS documentation for software installation
             in the OpenVMS System Management Subkit for detailed
             information about these options. If you specify more
             than one option, separate the options with commas
             (OPTIONS A,N).

             The following example invokes VMSINSTAL to install the
             APPC software from MTA0: and shows the system response.
             This example uses the OPTIONS N release note parameter.

             $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SNALU62024 MTA0: OPTIONS N <Return>
                   OpenVMS Software Product Installation Procedure V6.1

                 If you do not supply either the product name or the
                 device name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information
                 later in the installation procedure. VMSINSTAL does not
                 prompt you for any options; be sure to include OPTIONS
                 N on the VMSINSTAL command line to access the release
                 notes during the installation.

          2. Confirm system status.

             %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
                .
                .
                .
             * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]? YES <Return>

             VMSINSTAL displays a list of all active processes.
             The dialog then asks whether you want to continue the
             installation. You can install the APPC software if
             other processes are active. If you are reinstalling
             the software, you should verify that no one is using the
             APPC software. If you are satisfied that no one is using
             the APPC software, press <Return>. Otherwise, enter No
             to discontinue the installation.

          3. Confirm system backup.

             * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? <Return>

             VMSINSTAL asks whether or not you are satisfied with
             your system backup. You should always back up your
             system disk before performing an installation. If you
             are satisfied with the backup of your system disk,
             press <Return>. Otherwise, enter No to discontinue the
             installation. After you back up your system disk, you
             can restart the installation.

          4. Mount the media.

             Please mount the first volume of the set on MTA0:.
             * Are you ready? YES <Return>
             %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, SNALU6 MOUNTED ON _MTA0:
             The following products will be processed:

             %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

             You should now mount the first distribution volume on
             the device you specified when you invoked VMSINSTAL. The
             device name appears in the line preceding the question.
             VMSINSTAL then asks whether or not you are ready to
             continue with the installation.

                 If you respond Yes to indicate that you are ready,
                 VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing
                 the APPC software has been mounted on the specified
                 device and that the installation has begun.

                 If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
                 VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, enter No
                 in response to the "Are you ready?" question. To abort
                 the installation for other reasons, press <Ctrl/Y>.

              5. Select a release notes option.

                     Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

                     Additional Release Notes Options:

                         1.  Display release notes
                         2.  Print release notes
                         3.  Both 1 and 2
                         4.  None of the above

                 * Select option [2]: <Return>

                 If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL,
                 you are now asked to choose one of the four options for
                 reviewing the release notes.

                 If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes immediately on the console terminal. You can
                 terminate the display at any time by pressing <Ctrl/C>.

                 If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for the
                 name of the print queue that you want to use:

                 * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

                 You can press <Return> to send the file to the default
                 output print device or you can enter another queue name.

                 If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes immediately on the console terminal and then
                 prompts you for a queue name for the printed version.

                 Select option 4 if you have already reviewed the release
                 notes and are restarting the installation.

             Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following question:

             * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]?: YES <Return>
             %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to SYS$HELP.

             To continue the installation, enter Yes. Otherwise,
             press <Return>. In either case, the release notes are
             copied to a file in the SYS$HELP directory:

             SYS$HELP:SNALU62024.RELEASE_NOTES

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             The name of the release notes file created by
             VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name and
             version number. Do not delete release notes for
             previous versions of the APPC software.

             ______________________________________________________

          6. Respond to license registration queries. (LOAD HOST
             ONLY)

                     Product:      SNA-APPC-LU6.2
                     Producer:     DEC
                     Version:      2.4
                     Release Date: 01-SEP-1998

             * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded? Y <Return>

             If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, the
             installation dialog does not display any license
             information. Instead, it terminates with a message
             indicating that you should register and load your PAK
             to complete the installation successfully.

          7. Purge files.

             * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>

             You have the option of purging files from previous
             versions of the APPC software that are superseded by
             this installation. Compaq recommends purging; however,
             if you need to keep files from the previous version,
             enter No in response to the question.

             If you are reinstalling the software you should verify
             that no one is using the APPC software before you
             request that existing files be purged.

              8. Choose the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
                 option.

                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? <Return>

                 The installation procedure now asks whether or not
                 you want to run the IVP. The IVP for the APPC software
                 checks to be sure that the installation is successful.
                 Compaq recommends that you run the IVP.

                 After the APPC software is installed, you can run
                 the IVP independently to verify that the software is
                 available on your system (see Chapter 3).

              9. Read informational messages.

                 %SNALU62-I-NOQUEST, no further questions will be asked

                         To install the SNALU62SH.EXE and SNALU62MG.EXE images as shareable
                         each time the system reboots, you must add the following line to
                         your system startup procedure:

                                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNALU62$STARTUP

                         On line release notes for this product can be found in the file,
                                 SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP]SNALU62024.RELEASE_NOTES

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories

                 At this point, the installation procedure displays a
                 number of informational messages that report on the
                 progress of the installation. There are no further
                 questions. If the installation procedure is successful
                 up to this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new or modified
                 files to their target directories.

             10. Observe the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP).

                 If you chose to run the IVP, VMSINSTAL runs it now.
                 When the IVP runs successfully, you see the following
                 display:

                 ** DIGITAL SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface V2.4 Installation Test
                 Beginning **

         11. End the installation procedure.

                     Installation of SNALU62 V2.4 completed at 13:23

                  VMSINSTAL procedure done at 13:23

             The previous messages indicate that the entire
             installation procedure is complete.

             You can now log out of the privileged account:

             $ LOGOUT
             SYSTEM     logged out at 10-SEP-1998 15:24:34.23

             Note that VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in
             the process symbol tables during the installation.
             Therefore, if you are going to continue using the system
             manager's account and you want to restore these symbols,
             you should log out and log in again.

    Error Recovery

          If errors occur during the installation itself or when
          the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is running,
          VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
          fails, you see the following message:

          %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, the installation of SNALU62 V2.4 has failed.

          If the IVP fails, you see these messages:

          ** DIGITAL SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface V2.4 Installation Test
          Failed **

          %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for SNALU62 V2.4 has failed.

          Errors can occur during the installation for any of the
          following reasons:

          o  The operating system version is incorrect.

          o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

          o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
             insufficient.

          o  System parameter values for successful installation are
             insufficient.

          o  The OpenVMS help library is in use.

                                                   After the Installation


              This chapter describes some tasks to complete after you
              install the Programming Interface software.

        Verifying the Installation

              If you have chosen the IVP option, the IVP runs
              automatically at the end of the installation. You can
              also run the IVP after the installation to verify that
              the APPC/LU6.2 programming interface is installed and
              working properly. To do so after the installation, type
              the following command from your terminal:

              $ @SYS$TEST:SNALU62$IVP.COM

              The following message indicates that the software has been
              successfully installed:

        ** DIGITAL SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface V2.4 Installation Test Beginning **

        ... Testing the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface V2.4

        ** DIGITAL SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface V2.4 Test Completed Successfully **

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The IVP does not verify that the APPC/LU6.2
                Programming Interface can connect to an IBM system.

                ______________________________________________________

              If the software was not installed properly, error messages
              appear. Correct the problems indicated by the messages
              and rerun the installation procedure. If you receive
              IVP errors, you have a damaged kit; contact your Compaq
              representative.

              For information about configuring your IBM SNA software
              components for logical unit (LU) type 6.2 communications,
              see the appropriate Guide to IBM Parameters manual.

    Using the APPC/LU6.2 Software in a VMScluster

          After you have installed the APPC/LU6.2 software on one
          node of a VMScluster, you can install it on the other nodes
          by executing the SNALU62$STARTUP.COM procedure on each node
          as follows:

          $@SYS$STARTUP:SNALU62$STARTUP.COM

          You must activate an APPC/LU6.2 license for each node in
          the VMScluster that will execute and run the APPC/LU6.2
          software. You can activate the license in one of the
          following ways:

          o  Log in to each VMScluster node and enter the LICENSE
             LOAD command.

          o  Invoke the OpenVMS SYSMAN Utility to execute the LICENSE
             LOAD command on the desired VMScluster nodes. See the
             OpenVMS SYSMAN Utility Manual for details on defining
             your management environment, and executing commands on
             other nodes.

          For more information on the LICENSE LOAD command, refer to
          the OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

    Installing the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface as a Shareable
    Image

          SYS$STARTUP:SNALU62$STARTUP.COM contains the start-up
          command procedure for the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface.
          To install the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface as a
          shareable image, execute the command procedure as follows:

          $@SYS$STARTUP:SNALU62$STARTUP.COM

    3-2 After the Installation

 







              Include this command in your system start-up procedure to
              automatically install the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface
              as a shareable image when you boot the system.

        Adding the SNA_APPC HELP File to the HELP File of an Editor

              You can insert the APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface HELP
              information (added to the HELPLIB file during installation)
              into the HELP file of an editor, for programmers who use
              editors to develop DIGITAL SNA or OpenVMS SNA (OpenVMS
              VAX Version 6.1 and Version 6.2) applications. You need
              system manager privileges to perform this operation. Use
              the following commands to insert the HELP information into
              the HELP file of an editor:

              $ LIBRARY/HELP/EXTRACT=SNA_APPC/OUTPUT=SNAAPPC -
              _$ SYS$HELP:HELPLIB
              $ LIBRARY/HELP/INSERT SYS$HELP:xxxHELP SNAAPPC
              $ DELETE SNAAPPC.HLP;*

              where xxx is the name of your editor, for example, EDT or
              LSE.

                                               Sample Installation Dialog


              This appendix contains a sample installation dialog for
              the APPC software. The sample dialog was run on a system
              with no previous version of the APPC software. Depending on
              which layered products you have on your system, you might
              see additional messages and questions when you perform your
              installation.

              The sample installation assumes that DECnet has been shut
              down, that no users are logged on to your system, and that
              OPTIONS N is specified to print the Release Notes. The
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs at the end
              of the installation.
