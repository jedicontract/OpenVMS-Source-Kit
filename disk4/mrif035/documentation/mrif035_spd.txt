 PRODUCT NAME:  MAILbus(VAX Message Router Suite),       SPD 26.33.13
                Version 3.5

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX Message Router (MR) is the core component of Digital Equipment Cor-
 poration's MAILbus[TM] Message Transfer System. VAX Message Router is
 a layered software product that resides on OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] sys-
 tems and provides three services to MAILbus messaging networks - Mes-
 sage Transfer Service, Directory Service and Management Service. The
 primary use for Message Router and MAILbus is in interpersonal mes-
 saging (electronic mail or E-Mail) applications but it may be used by
 any application, such as DIGITAL's DEC/EDI Electronic Data Interchange
 software, needing to move information across a computer network.

 All components of Version 3.5 of MAILbus 1 are Year 2000 ready and de-
 ployed in conjunction with Year 2000 ready User Agents (see below) and
 Year 2000 ready versions of OpenVMS V7.1, V6.2 and V5.5-2 ensure that
 operations spanning the Millennium change and beyond behave correctly.

 Available as separate products are the VAX Message Router VMSmail Gate-
 way (MRGATE), which provides a connection between MAILbus and VMSmail
 - the OpenVMS Mail Utility, Message Router X.400 Gateway (MRX) and the
 VAX Message Router Programmer's Kit (MRIF) for developing applications
 that interface to MR's Message Transfer Service. V3.5 supercedes all
 previous versions of these components including V3.3A of MRGATE and
 MRIF and V2.3 of MRX.





                                                           July 1998

                                                         AE-X069N-TE

 Version 3.5 

 The IBM Gateways MR/PROFS and MR/SNADS have not been tested for Year
 2000 readiness and are not included in V3.5 of MAILbus. MRP and MRS
 will no longer be orderable past July 1998 and are in retirement from
 August 1998.

 Message Transfer Service

 VAX Message Router provides a store and forward reliable transfer ser-
 vice for messages through a DECnet[TM] network. These messages can con-
 tain any information needing transport within a DECnet network, in-
 cluding text, data and arbitrary files. Message structure closely re-
 sembles that described in the CCITT X.400 Recommendations for Message
 Handling Systems. However, messages use the encoding method described
 in the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST, for-
 merly the National Bureau of Standards - NBS) Specification for the
 Message Format for Computer Based Messaging Systems.

 In addition to Message Router, User Agents - application programs such
 as DIGITAL Office Server and ALL-IN-1[TM] Office Server Options V3.2
 - are required for an originator to create a message or a recipient
 to read a message when it is delivered. MAILbus Gateways connecting
 to other vendors' messaging systems or to public messaging networks
 can also be sources or destinations for messages. Organizations may
 develop their own applications, using the VAX Message Router Program-
 mer's Kit, to send and receive messages through Message Router.

 Message Router provides full support for delivery notification ser-
 vices and transmission of service and status messages. Network man-
 agers may establish routing schemes for messages by relying on default
 DECnet configurations, destination routing using route tables or area
 routing for large complex networks involving interconnected "hub" nodes
 for each area.

 MAILbus(VAX Message Router Suite),                     SPD 26.33.13
 Version 3.5
 
 Message Router contains the MAILbus Directory Service (DDS). DDS is
 a single logical directory of subscribers and other MAILbus network
 information which can be distributed across a number of MR systems.
 End users, through their user agents, may make inquiries of the di-
 rectory to find the address of their correspondents. MRX uses DDS for
 address translation for message originators and/or recipients in other
 vendors' messaging networks or external networks. DDS has utilities
 to allow replication and automatic update of directory information across
 the MR nodes in a MAILbus network. DDS will optimally support a pop-
 ulation of up to 20,000 subscribers and/or 30 MR nodes.

 Version 3.5
 
 Management Service

 The MR Management Service monitors the mail network for error and ex-
 ception conditions and helps with routine management of Message Router.
 Error and exception reports may be delivered to the MR network man-
 ager as events happen and/or on a scheduled basis. Management Action
 Procedures recommend corrective procedures for specific conditions.
 For complex networks, use of DIGITAL Commander (previously known as
 MAILbus Monitor), is recommended to assist in the management of the
 messaging network.

 VAX Message Router VMSmail Gateway

 The VAX Message Router VMSmail Gateway (MRGATE), available as a sep-
 arate layered software product, provides an interface between the MAIL-
 bus Message Transfer Service and the OpenVMS Mail Utility. MRGATE pro-
 vides conversion between the NIST protocols of Message Router and the
 MAIL-11 protocols of VMSmail. Address conversion is accomplished through
 use of an extended address syntax without reference to the DDS Direc-
 tory Service.

 Limited document content conversion is performed on messages passing
 from Message Router to VMSmail. WPS-PLUS[TM] and DECdx[TM] format doc-
 uments are converted to ASCII text format. Any other file types are
 passed through MRGATE unconverted. If a message contains multiple text
 attachments, these attachments are concatenated into a single ASCII
 text message for onward transmission through VMSmail. If the message
 contains unlike attachments, a set of pre-defined rules determine which
 attachments are forwarded to VMSmail and which are dropped, since VMS-
 mail does not support multiple content types in a single message. Only
 text message transfer is supported when the message recipient's sys-
 tem is running the OpenVMS Mail Utility, Version 5.1 or earlier.

 No content conversion is performed on messages passing from VMSmail
 to Message Router.

 To provide connection to MAILbus, the VAX Message Router software is
 required by and included with the license and media kit for VAX Mes-
 sage Router VMSmail Gateway.

 VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway

 VAX Message Router X.400 (MRX) Gateway is a network server layered soft-
 ware product that resides on an OpenVMS VAX system and provides in-
 terconnection between MAILbus and a CCITT 1984 X.400 Message Handling
 System. Together, VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway and VAX Message Router
 (MR) form a Message Transfer Agent conforming to the CCITT 1984 X.400
 Series of Recommendations for Message Handling Systems, and can act
 as either a Private Management Domain (private messaging network) or
 an Administration Management Domain (public messaging network).

 The MRX Gateway allows users of systems connected to MAILbus to com-
 municate with users of X.400 Message Handling Systems. Users of sys-
 tems connected through other gateways to MAILbus can also access the
 MRX Gateway and systems connected through it. The MRX Gateway can be
 connected to an X.400 Gateway from another system vendor, to an X.400
 Private Management Domain, or to an X.400 Administration Management
 Domain. Applications such as DEC/EDI (Digital's Electronic Data In-
 terchange) software can also use MRX as a connection to public and pri-
 vate networks.

 The VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway interworks with systems that con-
 form to the CCITT X.400 1984 recommendations as defined in the pro-
 files produced by:

 o  Stable Implementation Agreements for Open Systems Interconnection
    Protocols: Part 7 - 1984 Message Handling Systems, Output from De-
    cember 1992 OSI Implementors Workshop (NIST - National Institute
    of Science and Technology).

 o  CEN/CENELEC ENV 41 201 (profile(A/3211) for private domains)

 o  CEN/CENELEC ENV 41 202 (profile(A/311) for administration domains)

 These profiles are not uniform and where differences exist, the prod-
 uct follows the NIST profile. Some restrictions on the level of ser-
 vice obtained between message originator and recipient may apply if
 all the systems involved in the message transfer do not conform to the
 X.400 Recommendations.

 MRX Message Content Conversion

 The MRX Gateway provides translation and conversion services between
 the NIST/NBS protocols and service elements of MAILbus and those spec-
 ified by the X.400 Recommendations. Message content conversion is also
 performed by MRX. Digital's WPS-PLUS, DECdx, ASCII (Digital Multi-National
 Character Set), DDIF (Digital Document Interchange Format) and text
 document formats are converted to IA5, Teletex or ISO 6937 formats when
 passed from the MAILbus to the X.400 network. IA5, Teletex or ISO 6937
 documents received from the X.400 network are passed into MAILbus as
 ASCII (DIGITAL Multi-National Character Set) text files.

 The MRX Gateway also supports the transmission and receipt of binary
 data using the Undefined BodyPart (Tag 14) feature described in the
 CCITT X.400-Series Implementor's Guide, 1986 and the NIST Stable Im-
 plementation Agreements for Open Systems Interconnection Protocols,
 Version 6, 1992. The product documentation describes the capabilities
 and limitations of binary file transfer using the MRX Gateway.

 Unconverted transmission and receipt of WPS-PLUS and all DIGITAL RMS
 file formats directly to and from another domain with which a bilat-
 eral agreement has been made and which also uses VAX Message Router
 X.400 Gateway for the connection is possible using the USABodyPart (Tag
 310), as described in the NIST Stable Implementation Agreements for
 Open Systems Interconnection Protocols, Version 6, 1992.

 Conversion alternatives are chosen on a gateway wide basis during the
 configuration process for VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway.

 The VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway is designed to conform with U.S.
 GOSIP Version 1.0 and U.K. GOSIP, Version 3.1.

 The Directory Service (DDS), part of VAX Message Router, is used for
 address translation between X.400 Originator/Recipient (O/R) Names and
 MAILbus addresses when messages are transferred to or from the X.400
 network. This directory is also used to authorize originators of out-
 going messages to the X.400 network.

 The MRX Gateway may use either an X.25 wide area network link or an
 IEEE 802.3/ISO 8802-3/Ethernet local area network to communicate with:

 o  Another X.400 Gateway (back-to-back) within the same network

 o  Another vendor's X.400 MTA within the same network

 o  A private domain (from a private or administration domain)

 o  An administration domain (from a private or administration domain)

 Version 3.5
 
 To provide connection to MAILbus, the VAX Message Router software is
 required by and included with the software license and media kit for
 VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway.

 VAX Message Router Programmer's Kit

 Available as a separate product, the VAX Message Router Programmer's
 Kit (MRIF) consists of a run-time library of high-level interface rou-
 tines that may be built into user applications and a Programming Guide
 to assist users in writing those applications. This material simpli-
 fies the development of the application program modules that assem-
 ble and disassemble messages, post and fetch messages from Message Router,
 and handle messaging service elements.

 A message transfer service remote access routine for OpenVMS Alpha sys-
 tems is provided. An application developed using MRIF may be ported
 to run on an OpenVMS Alpha system and make remote connection to the
 OpenVMS VAX system on which VAX Message Router resides.

 MRIF is required only for application development. The applications
 developed using it may be run on any MR system without MRIF being in-
 stalled on that system, MR itself containing the necessary run time
 libraries. The remote access routine for OpenVMS Alpha systems allows
 applications developed using MRIF to be ported to OpenVMS Alpha sys-
 tems and to connect to any MR system without MRIF being installed on
 that system.

 To provide connection to MAILbus, the VAX Message Router software is
 required by and is included with the license and media kit for VAX Mes-
 sage Router Programmer's Kit.
