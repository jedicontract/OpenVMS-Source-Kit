Preparing to Install the Software

  Perform the following tasks before you install the terminal server software 
  on your system (referred to as the load host in this procedure):

  1. Check your load host for the following:

     a.	VMS  V5.0 or any subsequent maintenance release up to the next major 
	product release is installed.

     b. DECnet VAX[TM] Phase IV is running.

     c.	The Ethernet controller is on the same Ethernet as the terminal server.

  2. Ensure that the CMKRNL and SYSPRV privileges are set.

  3. Verify that the load host has 2500 blocks of available disk space (2000 
     after installation), and an additional 2048 blocks for each up-line dump.

  4. Backup the system before installing the software.

  5. Mount the software media on an appropriate device drive, unless you are 
     installing from save sets copied from another load host.

  6. Make a note of  the terminal server DECnet node address, DECnet node 
     name (supplied by the network manager), and the Ethernet hardware address 
     (supplied by the hardware installer).

  Installation requires approximately 5 minutes to complete.

				NOTE

		License Management Facility (LMF) is not required.

 

Using VMSINSTAL

  Perform the following to install the terminal server software on the load 
  host.  To stop the installation at any time,  press Ctrl/Y.  

  7. Log in to the system manager account.

  8. Enter the @SYS$UPDATE VMSINSTAL DS3021 your-device-identifier 
     OPTIONS N command to start VMSINSTAL.  Substitute your device identifier 
     for your-device-identifier where the distribution medium is mounted.

  9. If there are any active processes, VMSINSTAL lists them and asks if you 
     want to continue.  Enter YES to continue the installation. 

  10. Press Return if you have backed up your system disk,  and enter YES if 
      you mounted the software media on the appropriate device.

  11. Select option 2 (recommended) to print the release notes.   Press the 
      Return key to print the release notes on the default printer or specify 
      another print queue.                   

      If you select option 1, the release notes scroll on your terminal.  Be 
      aware that the release notes file can contain as many as 30 screens.

  12.Enter YES to continue the installation.

  * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]? YES
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  



Using VMSINTAL (cont.) 

  13. Press the Return key to run the Installation Verification Procedure 
      (IVP), which is recommended.  The IVP verifies that the DECSERVER 
      directory exists, all the files from the distribution kit are in the 
      directory, and the release notes are in the SYS$HELP directory.  

  14. If your system is part of a VAXcluster system, use the CREATE/DIRECTORY 
      command on each VAXcluster node after exiting VMSINSTAL so that the 
      other nodes can execute the terminal server software.  You can do this 
      after you finish this installation procedure.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Do you want to run the IVP after installation [YES]?
  %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set B...
  %VMSINSTAL-I-SYSDIR, This product creates a system directory [DECSERVER]

  If you intend to execute this layered product on other nodes in your 
  VAXcluster, and you have the appropriate software license, you must 
  prepare the system-specific roots on the other nodes by issuing the 
  following command on each node (using a suitably privileged account):

  $ CREATE/DIRECTORY SYS$SPECIFIC:[DECSERVER]
  /PROTECTION=(S:RWED,O:RWED, G:WER,W)
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Using VMSINSTAL (cont.)

  15. If you receive one of the following messages, perform the procedure 
      described within the message to update the MOM$LOAD logical name.

  One possible message:


  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Your installation is now complete. After exiting from VMSINSTAL:

  1. Modify the definition of MOM$LOAD in your system start-up file, 
  SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM, to resemble the following:

  $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/NAME=NO_ALIAS/NOLOG -
	MOM$LOAD -
	SYS$SYSROOT:[MOM$SYSTEM], -
	SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]

  This command ensures that the location of the server image is defined each 
  time the system is rebooted, necessary for successful down-line loading.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Another possible message:


  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Your installation is now complete. After exiting from VMSINSTAL:

  1. Add the following  command to your system start-up file, 
  SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM, to resemble the following:

  $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/NAME=NO_ALIAS/NOLOG -
	MOM$LOAD -
	SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]

  This command ensures that the location of the server image is defined each 
  time the system is rebooted, necessary for successful down-line loading.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


     MOM$LOAD is a logical name that your load host uses to find the image 
     file of any product that must be down-line loaded. For each product, 
     MOM$LOAD has an associated equivalent string that specifies the location 
     of the product image file.  

     If you do not get either of these messages,  no modifications to the 
     system start-up file are necessary.



Using VMSINSTAL (cont.)

  16. VMSINSTAL is completed. Proceed to step 17. 

  This IVP command procedure is for informational purposes.   You do not need 
  to run it again at this time.


  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2. Configure the server into your host's database.  Execute a command 
  procedure called DSVCONFIG.COM.  This command procedure is in the 
  SYS$ROOT:[DECSERVER] directory.  If you have already executed this procedure 
  from previous installations, you only need to configure  additional units. 
  All previously defined units will still be configured.

  The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for the DECserver 300 can be 
  found in SYS$TEST and may be run at any time by executing the command 
  procedure DS3$IVP.COM.

  VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories...

  Beginning installation verification procedure for DECserver 300 V2.1 completed

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Using DSVCONFIG             

  17. If you are using the optional Terminal Server Manager (TSM) software, 
      do not use the DSVCONFIG procedure; instead, refer to Terminal Server 
      Manager Installation and Use to configure the load host database.

  DSVCONFIG checks for data file DSVCONFIG.DAT in SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] or 
  SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER] for VAXcluster systems.  It finds one of three 
  situations:

  o	The file does not exist. The procedure creates DSVCONFIG.DAT.

  o	The file exists and is formatted correctly.

  o	The file exists but not in the correct format. The procedure 
	reformats the file.

  Each VAXclusterTM node might have an older version of  DSVCONFIG.DAT. In this 
  case, DSVCONFIG copies the terminal server entries from that data file into 
  the DSVCONFIG.DAT file on SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER], and renames the  file in 
  SYS$SPECIFIC so that the DSVCONFIG.DAT file in SYS$COMMON is used thereafter.

				CAUTION

  Do not execute any DECnet commands that  are part of DSVCONFIG separate from 
  the DSVCONFIG procedure.  Otherwise, DECnet databases could be changed with-
  out changing DSVCONFIG.DAT, causing a synchronization problem.



Using DSVCONFIG (cont.)            

  18. Set the default to MOM$LOAD and start DSVCONFIG as shown in the 
      example.  You might get merging messages if you are on a VAXcluster 
      system.

  19. Select option 2 to add a new terminal server.             


  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  $ SET DEFAULT MOM$LOAD: 
  $ @DSVCONFIG 


  You must assign a unique DECnet node  name  and  DECnet  node address for 
  each new DECserver unit.

  Press <RET> to start, or <CTRL/Z> to exit...

Using DSVCONFIG  (cont.)

  20. Enter the following:

      -	DS300 for the DECserver type

      -	DECnet node name and address

        DSVCONFIG determines the validity of the node name entered.  If you 
        get an error here, choose another node name.  The one you specified 
        is in use.

      -	Terminal server Ethernet address

  21. DSVCONFIG determines the load host service circuit-ID and displays this 
      ID as the default.  Press the Return key to select the default service 
      circuit-ID.

      DSVCONFIG adds the entry for the new terminal server to the databases 
      and sets SERVICE ENABLED on the specified service circuit,  which is 
      necessary for down-line loading.   If you get an error from DECnet while
      adding a terminal server, use option 4 to remove the entry, correct the 
      problem, then try again.

  If you get an error message now, the new DECserver unit will not be 
  completely added, and you should use menu item #4 (Delete an existing 
  DECserver) to remove it from the list of known DECservers.

Down-Line Loading the Software

  If you are installing a new terminal server,  down-line loading of the 
  software image is done automatically during power up of the hardware.  If 
  this is the case, do not  perform steps 24 through 28; instead, proceed to 
  step 29.

  24. Enter the NCP CONNECT NODE node-name command to connect to the terminal 
      server. (Substitute your terminal server DECnet node name for node-name.)
      If a maintenance password has been defined by the terminal server 
      manager, use the following command: CONNECT NODE node-name SERVICE 
      PASSWORD password. (Substitute your terminal server maintenance password
      for password.) 

  25. Press the Return key to get the terminal server prompt.  Enter the 
      log-in password.  ACCESS is the terminal server default log-in password.

  26. Enter your user name (a string of 1 to 16 characters).

  27. Use the SET PRIVILEGED command and enter the password. The default 
      password is SYSTEM.

  28. Use the INITIALIZE command to  down-line load the terminal server image 
      to the terminal server.  The qualifier, DELAY xx, causes the terminal 
      server to wait xx minutes before initializing.  This permits any 
      existing users time to log off.  You must also wait xx minutes before 
      you can continue with the procedure.

Down-Line Loading the Software (cont.)

  Perform steps 29 through 34 to verify the down-line load. 

  29. Enter the NCP CONNECT NODE node-name command to connect to the terminal 
      server.  (Substitute your terminal server DECnet node name for 
      node-name.)  If a maintenance password has been defined by the terminal 
      server manager,  use the following command: CONNECT NODE node-name 
      SERVICE PASSWORD password.  (Substitute your terminal server maintenance
      password for password.)

  30. Press the Return key to get the terminal server prompt.  Enter the 
      log-in password.  ACCESS is the terminal server default log-in password.

  31. Read the identification message to ensure the latest version (Vn.n) of 
      the terminal server image was down-line loaded. 

  32. Enter your user name (any string of 1 to 16 characters).

  33. Press Ctrl/D to return to the NCP prompt. 

  34. Enter EXIT to return to the VMS system prompt. 

  If this installation is a software upgrade, either you or the network manager 
  can now reload all existing terminal servers.

Completing the Installation

  Perform the following if the installation is complete:

  35. Optionally, you should install the kit on at least two load hosts.  
      Also, you should have one load host for every 10 terminal servers.

  36. Inform the system manager or network manager that the installation is 
      complete.

  37. Give this document to the person who will be managing the terminal 
      server.

Installing Software on Additional VMS Hosts                             

  To install the server distribution software onto an additional VMS load host 
  that is not a member of a VAXcluster system, follow these steps:

  1. Invoke VMSINSTAL at the original load host, as follows.  (Substitute 
     your device drive identifier for your-device-identifier.)

     $ @VMSINSTAL DS3021  your-device-identifier OPTIONS G SYS$UPDATE:

     OPTIONS G stores the save sets in the SYS$UPDATE directory.

  2. Copy the save sets from the original load host to the alternate load 
     host's SYS$UPDATE directory. The save sets are DS3nnn.A and DS3nnn.B, 
     where nnn is the version number of the DECserver 300 software.  For 
     example, nnn  equals 021 for version 2.1.

  3. Run VMSINSTAL on the alternate load  host.



What To Do If the Installation Fails

  Perform the following if the installation fails:

  1. If the down-line load fails, it could be that service on the circuit is 
     disabled.  The following command shows how to check service circuit 
     BNA-0.  Substitute your load host service circuit-ID for BNA-0. 

     $ MCR NCP 
     NCP> SHOW CIR BNA-0 CHAR 


     a. If the display shows that the service is disabled, enter the following 
        command to check if there are any users or applications using the 
        circuit:

        NCP> SHOW KNOWN LINKS 

     b. If there are no known links active, enter the following commands to 
        enable service circuit BNA-0.  Enabling the circuit disconnects the 
        active links. 

        NCP> SET CIR BNA-0 STATE OFF
        NCP> SET CIR BNA-0 SERVICE ENABLED
        NCP> SET CIR BNA-0 STATE ON
        NCP> EXIT
        $

  2. If your load host has more than one Ethernet controller, be sure that 
     the correct service circuit-ID was used during the DSVCONFIG procedure.
     If you do not know the load host service circuit-ID, use the NCP command 
     SHOW ACTIVE CIRCUITS to display active circuit characteristics.
