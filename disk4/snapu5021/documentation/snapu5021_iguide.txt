              The DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway-CT and DIGITAL SNA Domain
              Gateway-ST are combination hardware and software systems
              that allow communication between non-SNA networks (DECnet
              and TCP/IP) and IBM SNA (Systems Network Architecture)
              networks.

              This manual explains how to install the Domain Gateway
              software on VAX processors that are running the OpenVMS VAX
              operating system and on Alpha processors that are running
              the OpenVMS Alpha operating system.

              Keep this document with your distribution kit. You will
              need it if you need to reinstall the Domain Gateway
              software.

             Preparing to Install the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software


              This chapter discusses the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway
              software.

        Inspecting the Distribution Kit

              The software Bill of Materials (BOM) included with your
              media distribution kit lists the contents of the kit.
              Carefully compare the items you received with the items
              listed in the BOM. If any components are missing or
              damaged, contact your DIGITAL representative before
              continuing with the installation.

              The DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway product provides online
              release notes. DIGITAL strongly recommends that you read
              the release notes before proceeding with the installation.
              For information about accessing the release notes, see
              Chapter 2.

        Verifying Required Operating System Components

              The OpenVMS operating system comes with a variety of
              support options, or classes. Classes include such features
              as networking and RMS journaling. For a complete list of
              the required classes, see the Software Product Description
              (SPD).

        Verifying Prerequisite Hardware

              You can install the Domain Gateway software on any VAX or
              Alpha processor listed in the SPD. In addition to a VAX or
              Alpha processor, you will need a DEC ChannelServer (DESNA)
              or DEC ChannelServer II (DESNB) for a Domain Gateway-CT or
              a DEC MicroServer (DEMSA) or DEC MicroServer-SP (DEMSB) for
              a Domain Gateway-ST.

    Verifying Prerequisite and Optional Software

          The Software Product Description (SPD) contains a complete
          list of prerequisite and optional software with their
          required version numbers.

          Before you install the Domain Gateway software, you must
          have one of the OpenVMS operating system versions specified
          in the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway SPD.

          Use the SHOW SYSTEM command to determine the current
          version of the OpenVMS operating system on your processor.
          If you do not have one of the required versions, you must
          install it before you install the Domain Gateway software.

          In addition to having one of the prerequisite operating
          system versions, you must have one of the DECnet network
          software versions specified in the DIGITAL SNA Domain
          Gateway SPD.

          Use the MCR NCL SHOW NODE node-name ALL CHARACTERISTICS
          command. If this command succeeds, check the returned
          version information to see that you have a supported
          version of the DECnet software. If the version is
          unsupported, you must install the required DECnet software
          before installing the Domain Gateway software.

          If the command fails, your node has no DECnet software. You
          must install the required DECnet software before installing
          the Domain Gateway software.

    Registering the License Product Authorization Key (PAK)

          Before you install and run the Domain Gateway software,
          you must first register a License Product Authorization
          Key (License PAK) using the License Management Facility
          (LMF). The License PAK may be shipped along with the kit if
          you ordered the license and media together; otherwise, it
          is shipped separately to a location based on your license
          order.

          If you are installing prerequisite or optional software
          along with the Domain Gateway software, review the PAK
          status and install PAKs for any prerequisite or optional
          software before you install the Domain Gateway software.

    1-2 Preparing to Install the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software

 







              You must register and load your license for the Domain
              Gateway software before you start the installation in order
              to use the software.

              To register a license under OpenVMS, first log in to the
              system manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice of
              two ways to perform the registration:

              o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it
                 prompts you for information, respond with data from your
                 License PAK.

              o  At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command
                 with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to
                 License PAK information.

              For complete information about using LMF, see the OpenVMS
              License Management Utility Manual.

        Special Considerations for Installing the Domain Gateway Software

              This section describes the special installation
              requirements for the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway product.

              Before you install the Domain Gateway software, you
              must select the DECnet nodes where you wish to load the
              software. A DECnet SNA network using the DIGITAL SNA Domain
              Gateway product has the following DECnet nodes:

              o  Gateway node: For the Domain Gateway-CT, this is a DEC
                 ChannelServer or DEC ChannelServer II running the Domain
                 Gateway-CT software. For the Domain Gateway-ST, this
                 is a DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-SP running the
                 Domain Gateway-ST software.

              o  Gateway load host node: This is a OpenVMS DECnet node
                 from which you load the Domain Gateway system image onto
                 the Gateway node. You must install both the management
                 software and the Domain Gateway system image on the load
                 host node.

              o  Gateway management node: This is a OpenVMS DECnet node
                 from which you manage the operation of the DIGITAL SNA
                 Domain Gateway product. You install only the management
                 software on a Gateway management node. You can have
                 multiple Gateway management nodes for a single Gateway.

          o  Gateway access node: This is a non-SNA node with one
             or more access routine products installed. The access
             node must be running the version of the operating system
             (OpenVMS, DIGITAL UNIX, or MS-DOS) that the particular
             access routines require. Many of the access routines
             suggest that you install the Gateway management software
             on the access node to aid in access routine problem
             resolution. See the SPDs for the individual access
             routines for information about the required operating
             system and the network software versions.

             ________________________ Notes ________________________

             You must perform a license PAK load on each node on
             which you plan to install the Domain Gateway load
             host software kit. You do not need to license those
             nodes where you will install only the Domain Gateway
             management software kit.

             Each new version of the Domain Gateway software
             contains new versions of the SNAP and CTF utilities
             included in the management software. Therefore, you
             should install the new version of the management
             software on all nodes where you have previously
             installed the management software kit.

    Special Considerations for Installing the Domain Gateway Software
    on a VMScluster System

          This section describes the special installation
          requirements for installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway
          product on a VMScluster system.

          Before you install the Domain Gateway on a VMScluster
          system, you must de-install the Domain Gateway CTF analysis
          routines from each of the VMScluster members. On each node
          of the VMScluster system, enter the following command:

          $ mcr install sys$library:ctf$snapu5_analyze/delete <Return>

        Verifying Installation Procedure Requirements

              This section and those that follow discuss various
              requirements for installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway
              product.

              The installation takes approximately 5 to 15 minutes,
              depending on your distribution media and your system
              configuration.

        Privileges and Disk Space

              To install the Domain Gateway, you must log in to an
              account that has the SETPRV privilege or at least the
              following privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

              DIGITAL recommends installing from the SYSTEM account.

              Note that VMSINSTAL turns off BYPASS privileges at the
              start of the installation.

              Verify that your account has sufficient privileges before
              you install the Domain Gateway software. Use the DCL SHOW
              PROCESS/PRIVILEGE command to check your privileges.

              The Domain Gateway's requirements for free disk
              storage space are different during installation and
              after installation. Table 1-1 summarizes the storage
              requirements.

          Verify that you have adequate disk space before you install
          the Domain Gateway software. You can check your available
          disk space by entering the following command at the DCL
          prompt:

          $ SHOW DEVICE system-disk

          where system-disk refers to the device name of the system
          disk.

    VMSINSTAL Requirements

          When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

          o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account

          o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation

          o  Whether DECnet is running

          o  Whether any users are logged in to the system










    1-6 Preparing to Install the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software

 







              Note that VMSINSTAL requires the installation account to
              have at least the following quotas:

                 ASTLM = 24
                 BIOLM = 18
                 BYTLM = 18,000
                 DIOLM = 18
                 ENQLM = 30
                 FILLM = 20

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks if you want to continue the
              installation. In some instances, you can enter Yes to
              continue. To stop the installation process and correct
              the situation, enter No or press <Return>. Then correct the
              problem and restart the installation.

        Backing Up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks
              whether or not you have backed up your system disk. DIGITAL
              recommends that you back up the system disk before you
              install any software.

              Use the backup procedures that are established at your
              site. For details about performing a system disk backup,
              see the section on the Backup utility in the OpenVMS System
              Management Subkit.

                       Installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software


              This chapter explains how to install the DIGITAL SNA Domain
              Gateway software.

        The Installation Dialog

              The Domain Gateway installation procedure consists of
              a series of questions and informational messages. See
              Appendix A for a sample installation.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              <Ctrl/Y>. When you press <Ctrl/Y>, the installation
              procedure deletes all the files it created up to that point
              and exits. You can then start the installation again.

              1. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

        $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name OPTIONS N

                 To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command
                 procedure from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM
                 account. VMSINSTAL is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. The
                 following list defines the parameters of the VMSINSTAL
                 command procedure.

                 saveset-name
                 The installation name for the software component. For
                 the Domain Gateway software, use the name SNAPU5021.

                 device-name
                 The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
                 media. For example, MTA0: is the device name for a tape
                 drive. It is not necessary to use the console drive for
                 this installation. However, if you do use the console
                 drive, you should replace any media you removed once the
                 installation is complete.

                   Installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software 2-1

 







             OPTIONS N
             An optional parameter that indicates you want to see the
             question about release notes. If you do not include the
             OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about
             the release notes. You should review the release notes
             before proceeding with the installation in case they
             contain additional information about the installation.
             If you are restarting the installation and have already
             reviewed the release notes, you do not need to specify
             OPTIONS N.

             Note that there are other options you can select when
             you invoke VMSINSTAL.

             o  Auto answer option (A): Initially creates a file
                that contains your answers to VMSINSTAL questions and
                prompts. You can then use the option (and the answer
                file) to save time during a reinstallation (typically
                after upgrading your system).

             o  Get save set option (G): Lets you store product save
                sets temporarily on a magnetic tape or in a disk
                directory.

             o  File log option (L): Logs all activity to the
                terminal during installation.

             o  Alternate root option (R): Lets you install the
                product on a system root other than that of the
                running system.

             See the OpenVMS documentation for software installation
             in the OpenVMS System Management Subkit for detailed
             information about these options. If you specify more
             than one option, separate the options with commas
             (OPTIONS A,N).

             The following example invokes VMSINSTAL to install the
             Domain Gateway software from MTA0: and shows the system
             response. This example uses the OPTIONS N release note
             parameter.

    $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SNAPU5021 MTA0: OPTIONS N <Return>
          OpenVMS Software Product Installation Procedure V6.1

    It is 16-MAY-1997 at 13:15.

    Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

                 If you do not supply either the product name or the
                 device name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information
                 later in the installation procedure. VMSINSTAL does not
                 prompt you for any options; be sure to include OPTIONS
                 N on the VMSINSTAL command line to access the release
                 notes during the installation.

          2. Confirm system status.

    %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
       .
       .
       .
    * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]? YES <Return>

             VMSINSTAL displays a list of all active processes.
             The dialog then asks whether you want to continue the
             installation. You can install the Domain Gateway if
             other processes are active. If you are reinstalling
             the software, you should verify that no one is using
             the Domain Gateway management software. If you are
             satisfied that no one is using the Gateway software,
             press <Return>. Otherwise, enter No to discontinue the
             installation.

          3. Confirm system backup.

    * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? <Return>

             VMSINSTAL asks whether or not you are satisfied with
             your system backup. You should always back up your
             system disk before performing an installation. If you
             are satisfied with the backup of your system disk,
             press <Return>. Otherwise, enter No to discontinue the
             installation. After you back up your system disk, you
             can restart the installation.

          4. Mount the media.

    Please mount the first volume of the set on MTA0:.
    * Are you ready? YES <Return>
    %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, SNAPU5 MOUNTED ON _MTA0:

    %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

             You should now mount the first distribution volume on
             the device you specified when you invoked VMSINSTAL. The
             device name appears in the line preceding the question.
             VMSINSTAL then asks whether or not you are ready to
             continue with the installation.

    2-4 Installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software

 







                 If you respond Yes to indicate that you are ready,
                 VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing
                 the Domain Gateway software has been mounted on the
                 specified device and that the installation has begun.

                 If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
                 VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, enter No
                 in response to the "Are you ready?" question. To abort
                 the installation for other reasons, press <Ctrl/Y>.

              5. Select a release notes option.

            Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

            Additional Release Notes Options:

                1.  Display release notes
                2.  Print release notes
                3.  Both 1 and 2
                4.  None of the above

        * Select option [2]: <Return>

                 If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL,
                 you are now asked to choose one of the four options for
                 reviewing the release notes.

                 If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes immediately on the console terminal. You can
                 terminate the display at any time by pressing <Ctrl/C>.

                 If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for the
                 name of the print queue that you want to use:

        * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

                 You can press <Return> to send the file to the default
                 output print device or you can enter another queue name.

                 If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes immediately on the console terminal and then
                 prompts you for a queue name for the printed version.

                 Select option 4 if you have already reviewed the release
                 notes and are restarting the installation.

             Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following question:

    * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]?: YES <Return>
    %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to SYS$HELP.

             To continue the installation, enter Yes. Otherwise,
             press <Return>. In either case, the release notes are
             copied to a file in the SYS$HELP directory:

    SYS$HELP:SNAPU5021.RELEASE_NOTES

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             The name of the release notes file created by
             VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name and
             version number. Do not delete release notes for
             previous versions of the Domain Gateway software.

             ______________________________________________________

          6. Select the type of installation.

            This kit contains the Load Host software needed to configure and
            downline load a DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway from this system.  This
            kit also contains the Management software needed to control and
            monitor a DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway.

            You can install

            [1] Load Host software and Management software
            [2] Management software only

    * Enter an option [1]:

             You have two installation options. The default selection
             (1) installs the complete software kit, including the
             management software. To start this process, press
             <Return>. This option requires that the product
             authorization key (PAK) be registered and loaded.
             Failure to do this causes the installation process
             to fail with an error message notifying you that the
             license must be installed. Refer to the PAK installation
             procedure for details. After registering and loading the
             PAK, restart the installation from the first step.

             If you want to install just the Gateway management
             software, enter 2, press <Return>, and proceed with
             the remainder of the installation procedure.

              7. Respond to license registration queries. (LOAD HOST
                 ONLY)

                Product:      SNA-DOMAIN-GATEWAY
                Producer:     DEC
                Version:      2.1
                Release Date: 01-MAY-1997

        * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded? Y <Return>

                 If you are installing the load host software, the
                 installation procedure displays license information
                 about your product and then asks if you have registered
                 and loaded your Product Authorization Key (PAK).
                 The installation procedure displays either the SNA-
                 DOMAIN-GATEWAY license information (as shown in the
                 preceding example) or the SNA-DOMAIN-GATEWAY-CT license
                 information.

                 If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, the
                 installation dialog does not display any license
                 information. Instead, it terminates with a message
                 indicating that you should register and load your PAK
                 to complete the installation successfully.

              8. Optionally, create the SNAPU5 directory. (LOAD HOST
                 ONLY)

               To maintain your Gateway, you will need a place to store answer
               files, script files, management files, dump files, etc. This
               installation can create a system directory, SYS$COMMON:[SNAPU5$],
               for that purpose.

        * Create the system directory [YES]?

                 If you are installing load host software, the
                 installation procedure asks whether or not you want
                 to create a directory in SYS$COMMON to store various
                 configuration-related files. If you do not want to
                 create a separate directory for these files, enter No.

              9. Purge files.

        * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>

                 You have the option of purging files from previous
                 versions of the Domain Gateway software that are
                 superseded by this installation. Digital recommends

                   Installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software 2-7

 







             purging; however, if you need to keep files from the
             previous version, enter No in response to the question.

             If you are reinstalling the software you should verify
             that no one is using the Domain Gateway management
             software before you request that existing files be
             purged.

         10. Choose the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
             option.

    * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? <Return>

             The installation procedure now asks whether or not you
             want to run the IVP. The IVP for the Domain Gateway
             checks to be sure that the installation is successful.
             Digital recommends that you run the IVP.

             After the Domain Gateway software is installed, you can
             run the IVP independently to verify that the software is
             available on your system (see Chapter 3).

         11. Read informational messages.

    %SNAPU5-I-NOMORE, there are no more questions
    %SNAPU5-I-TIME, the installation completes in approximately 15 minutes

    %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set B ...
    %VMSINSTAL-I-SYSDIR, This product creates system directory [SNAPU5$].

            You should execute the following command to configure the Domain
            Gateway:

                RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SNAPU5$CONFIGURE

            This step creates the Domain Gateway configuration files, completing
            the installation. You can create a management file and boot the
            Gateway at the end of the configuration procedure; the procedure
            will prompt you.

            For current information about the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway V2.1
            software product, read the file SYS$HELP:SNAPU5021.RELEASE_NOTES
            which is supplied by this installation.

    %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories

                 At this point, the installation procedure displays a
                 number of informational messages that report on the
                 progress of the installation. There are no further
                 questions. If the installation procedure is successful
                 up to this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new or modified
                 files to their target directories and updates help files
                 and the DCL tables.

             12. Observe the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP).

                 If you chose to run the IVP, VMSINSTAL runs it now.
                 When the IVP runs successfully, you see the following
                 display:

                Copyright (c) Electronic Data Systems Corporation 1997.

        IVP for DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway V2.1 succeeded.

             13. End the installation procedure.

                Installation of SNAPU5 V2.1 completed at 13:23

             VMSINSTAL procedure done at 13:23

                 The previous messages indicate that the entire
                 installation procedure is complete.

                 You can now log out of the privileged account:

        $ LOGOUT
        SYSTEM     logged out at 16-MAY-1997 15:24:34.23

                 Note that VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in
                 the process symbol tables during the installation.
                 Therefore, if you are going to continue using the system
                 manager's account and you want to restore these symbols,
                 you should log out and log in again.

    Error Recovery

          If errors occur during the installation itself or when
          the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is running,
          VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
          fails, you see the following message:

    %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, the installation of SNAPU5 V2.1 has failed.

          If the IVP fails, you see these messages:

    The SNAPU5 V2.1 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

    %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for SNAPU5 V2.1 has failed.

          Errors can occur during the installation for any of the
          following reasons:

          o  The operating system version is incorrect.

          o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

          o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
             insufficient.

          o  System parameter values for successful installation are
             insufficient.

          o  The OpenVMS help library is in use.

          o  The product license has not been registered and loaded.

          For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
          conditions, see the OpenVMS documentation on system
          messages, recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software
          installation. If you receive a notification of any of these
          conditions, you should take the action described in the
          message. For information about installation requirements,
          see Chapter 1.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             In addition to the errors described above, a series
             of re-installations of the Domain Gateway software
             on VMScluster systems may lead to an installation
             failure. This series of re-installations may lead
             to a situation where the installed CTF analysis
             routines reference a file that was purged during the
             re-installation. If this error occurs, you will see
             the following sequence:

    2-10 Installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software

 







        SYSTEM-W-NOSUCHFILE, no such file
         \$1$DUA0:[SYS0.SYSCOMMON.][SYSLIB]CTF$SNAPU%_ANALYZE.EXE\

        .
            .
            .

                To correct the error, you must de-install the CTF
                analysis routines. Use the following command on all
                VMScluster members:

        $ mcr install sys$library:ctf$snapu5_analyze/delete <Return>

                After you de-install the analysis routines, reinstall
                the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway software.

                                                                        3
        _________________________________________________________________

                 After Installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software


              This chapter describes the tasks you should do after you
              install the Domain Gateway software.

        Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

              You usually run the Installation Verification Procedure
              (IVP) during installation. If you want to run the IVP
              separately to ensure the integrity of installed files
              should system problems occur, execute the SNAPU5$IVP.COM
              command procedure:

              $ @SYS$TEST:SNAPU5$IVP.COM

        Preparing the IBM SNA Environment

              You must define specific system and network resources
              on the IBM system before you can use the Domain Gateway
              software. The DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Guide to IBM
              Resource Definition explains how to define these resources
              to establish communication between the Domain Gateway
              product and the IBM system.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Because IBM system programmers configure and perform
                maintenance on their systems according to set
                schedules, you should give them as much advance
                notice as possible to prepare for the Domain Gateway
                installation. Because the configuration process for
                the Domain Gateway has the option of accepting a VTAM
                or NCP PATH file, the IBM configuration should be
                completed before you configure the Gateway.

    Configuring and Loading the Domain Gateway Product

          After you have successfully installed the Domain Gateway
          software and before you can begin to use the Gateway, you
          must generate a configuration file and load the Gateway. To
          configure the Gateway, do the following tasks:

          o  Configure the necessary DECnet information on the
             Gateway's load host. Use the NET$CONFIGURE.COM command
             procedure located in the SYS$MANAGER directory.

          o  Using the command RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SNAPU5$CONFIGURE,
             invoke the Configuration utility and generate the NCL
             script file that contains a human-readable form of all
             the commands used to configure the Gateway software
             image.

          o  Create the loadable management file. This file contains
             the NCL commands from the script file in a machine-
             readable form.

          o  Load the Gateway using the NCL BOOT or LOAD command on
             the Gateway's load host.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             If you cannot reboot the Gateway's load host before
             you configure the Domain Gateway, you must define the
             logical NCL$ENVIRONMENT. using the following command:

             $ DEFINE NCL$ENVIRONMENT "PRIVATE"

             You do not need to define the logical if you can
             reboot the system before you configure the Domain
             Gateway.

             ______________________________________________________

             ___________________ When Upgrading ___________________

             If you are upgrading your software from a previous
             version of the Domain Gateway product and your
             configuration is not changing, you do not need to
             reconfigure the Gateway. Your existing loadable
             management files are fully compatible with this
             version.

             To use the new Gateway system image file on an
             upgraded load host, you must update the MOP client

    3-2 After Installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software

 







                database. To do this, use the NET$CONFIGURE.COM
                procedure to change the system image file name from
                SNAPU5$CT0xx.SYS to SNAPU5$CT.SYS or SNAPU5$ST0xx.SYS
                to SNAPU5$ST (where xx is 11 or 20).

                Reboot the Gateway to load the new image.

                See Chapter 13 in the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway
                Planning and Configuration manual.

                ______________________________________________________

              Refer to the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Planning and
              Configuration manual for information about configuring
              and loading the Gateway.

        Running the Primary Logical Unit Installation Verification
        Procedure

              The Domain Gateway software includes an Installation
              Verification Procedure (IVP) to test the functionality
              of a primary logical unit (PLU) on the Gateway.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                You must configure the Gateway and configure the
                adjacent IBM system before running this IVP.

                ______________________________________________________

              To run the IVP, do the following:

              1. Create an SNA ACCESS SERVER OBJECT entity that
                 references a numbered object on the Gateway's load host.
                 For example, to create the OBJECT entity IVP90 on the
                 Gateway ASHFLD referencing object 90 on the load host
                 LDHOST, use the following command.

                 NCL> CREATE NODE ASHFLD SNA ACCESS SERVER OBJECT IVP90 -
                 _NCL> TRANSPORT = DECNET, NODE = DEC:.LDHOST, NUMBER = 90

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you specified a privileged user name and password
                for the network management object on the Gateway,
                you must specify them after the node name in the
                NCL command. For example, if the user name is SYSTEM
                and the password is LETMEIN, then you would specify

             After Installing the DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software 3-3

 







             ASHFLD"SYSTEM LETMEIN" in all the NCL commands in this
             sequence.

             ______________________________________________________

          2. Create an SNA LU SERVICES LU entity that is a primary
             LU (PLU) and that references the OBJECT entity you just
             defined. For example, to create the LU entity IVPLU
             (assuming the Gateway's PU is DEC30), use the following
             command.

             NCL> CREATE NODE ASHFLD SNA LU SERVICES LU IVPLU -
             _NCL> PU = DEC30, -
             _NCL> CAPABILITY = PRIMARY, -
             _NCL> OBJECT = IVP90

          3. Enable the LU entity you just created. For example, to
             enable the LU entity IVPLU, use the following command.

             NCL> ENABLE NODE ASHFLD SNA LU SERVICES LU IVPLU

          4. Create the object you just referenced on the load host.
             To create the object, use the SYS$TEST:SNAPU5$IVP3270
             program as shown here:

             $ RUN SYS$TEST:SNAPU5$IVP3270

             DECnet/SNA 3270 Installation Verification Program V2.0.0

             Transport: DECnet = 0 or TCP/IP = 4 [0] : <Return>

             Transport selected is DECnet

             Object Number [10] : 90

             Creating Task Object "90="

              5. Connect to the Gateway's PLU using the USS screen of a
                 3270 SNA networked terminal on the adjacent IBM system.
                 Enter the command LOG APPLID in response to the SELECT
                 SYSTEM ====> prompt. For example, to connect to the PLU
                 IVPLU, use the following command.

                 SELECT SYSTEM ====> LOG APPLID (IVPLU)

              6. Verify the correct response at the 3270 terminal. You
                 should see the following:

                      DECnet/SNA 3270 Installation Verification Program

                      Terminal ..... T1228005

                 program on the load host by entering a <Ctrl/C>.

        Determining and Reporting Problems

              If you encounter a problem while using the Domain Gateway

                                               Sample Installation Output


              This appendix contains two sample installations of the
              Domain Gateway software. The samples were run on a system
              that had no previous installation of Domain Gateway
              software. Depending on which layered products you have
              on your system, you might see additional messages and
              questions when you perform your installation.

              The sample installations assume that DECnet has been shut
              down, that no users are logged on to your system, and that
              OPTIONS N is specified to print the release notes. The
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs at the end
              of the installation.

        Sample Management Node Installation

              This sample shows the dialog used to install the Gateway
              management software on a Gateway management node.
