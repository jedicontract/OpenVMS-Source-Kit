     11/782 Processor Restrictions

     An R80/RL02 configuration is required for VAX-11/730 systems.

     VAX workstations are not supported as down-line load hosts.

     A device capable of reading a TK50 is required to install DEC-
     server 250 software on MicroVAX 2000 or VAXstation 2000 systems.

     The DECserver 250 software runs on the following packaged hard-
     ware option:

     DSRVP-        DECserver 250 hardware, including two Digital
     AA/AB         (Dataproducts compatible) parallel asynchronous
                   ports with speeds up to 2000 LPM and four EIA RS-
                   232-C/CCITT V.24 asynchronous ports supporting
                   speeds up to 19.2K Baud on two ports and 9.6K Baud
                   on two ports, factory set at 120V/240V.

     The DECserver 250 hardware requires both a transceiver drop
     cable and Ethernet connection, H4005 or DELNI or DESTA, to
     connect to the Ethernet physical channel.

     Use the following SHIELDED cables with each of the physical
     lines on the DECserver 250 unit:

     Parallel Printer

     BC27A - Parallel printer connections.

     LLF01/BN25J - Fiber optic based connection for parallel printers
     to be remotely placed (not shielded).

     Serial Printer

     BC22D - Null modem cable for local terminal or serial printer
     connections.

     Printer/Terminal

     BC22E - Full modem straight through cable for modem connections.

     BC22F - Full modem straight through cable for modem connections.

     BC22R - Recommended null modem cable for host systems and other
     devices, including those which utilize CTS/RTS flow control.

     BC17D - Null modem cable for host systems and other devices
     which do not utilize CTS/RTS flow control.

     All software run on the DECserver 250 is down-line loaded over
     the Ethernet from a Phase IV DECnet load host.

     Block Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

     Disk space required for      700 blocks
     installation:
                                  (358K bytes)

     Disk space required for      600 blocks
     use (permanent):
                                  (307K bytes)

     The block space requirements above refer to the disk space
     required on the down-line load host system disk. The sizes are
     approximations; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
     system environment, configuration, and software options.
