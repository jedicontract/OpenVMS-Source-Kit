              Preface


                      This installation guide explains how to:

                      o  Install the DECserver 250 distribution software
                         onto a VAX/VMS system running DECnet Phase IV
                         so that this system can then perform as a load
                         host. The potential load host can be a single
                         system or a member node of a VAXcluster.

                      o  Configure the load host's node database.

                      o  Verify the installation by first down-line
                         loading the server image to the DECserver 250
                         unit and then testing a few server commands.

              __________________________________________________________
              Intended Audience

                      This guide is for system managers or network
                      managers who are responsible for making server
                      products available on Ethernet. A system manager
                      is responsible for the VAX/VMS system that is
                      about to be established as a load host. A network
                      manager is the person responsible for the Local
                      Area Network (LAN).

                      To use this guide effectively, you should be
                      familiar with both DECnet Phase IV network
                      management concepts and the VAX/VMS operating
                      system.

              1       Introducing the DECserver 250 Server for Printers



              __________________________________________________________
              1.1 What Is the DECserver 250 Server for Printers?

                      The DECserver 250 server for printers is a
                      hardware and software product that connects
                      to an Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN). The
                      server connects two parallel printer ports,
                      three asynchronous serial printer ports, and
                      one asynchronous port (for either a terminal
                      or serial printer that is a console device)
                      to a LAN, allowing only the console device to
                      communicate as a terminal with the other nodes on
                      that LAN.

                      The software that you are about to install
                      consists of the files in the DECserver 250
                      distribution kit. After installing the
                      distribution software onto your VAX/VMS system,
                      configure your system's node database for all
                      new servers. Next, verify the installation by
                      down-line loading one test server. Down-line
                      loading means sending the server image from the
                      established load host to the server. Finally,
                      issue a few server commands to test the server
                      system. The rest of this chapter describes
                      DECserver 250 features and concepts and gives an
                      overview of your responsibilities as the software
                      installer.

              __________________________________________________________
              1.2 DECserver 250 Concepts

                      The DECserver 250 unit gives printer access
                      to all services of the LAN, supporting direct
                      connections.



                                                                     1-1

 





                      Introducing the DECserver 250 Server for Printers



              _____________________________
              1.2.1 Connections

                      The DECserver 250 unit connects the following
                      devices:

                      o  Two parallel printers

                      o  Three serial printers

                      o  One terminal - port 1 only

                      Port devices can be connected directly to the
                      server or, on port 1, they can be connected
                      remotely by using a modem. The DECserver 250
                      unit supports printers and connections to hosts
                      that support parallel, asynchronous, and RS-232-C
                      connections.

              _____________________________
              1.2.2 Services

                      The DECserver 250 unit gives printers access
                      to services offered on the LAN. A service is a
                      resource such as a computer. A DECserver 250 user
                      on port 1 can maintain up to six simultaneous
                      connections to these various services.

              _____________________________
              1.2.3 Service Nodes and LAT Protocol

                      Server users are offered services by service
                      nodes. A service node is any node on the LAN
                      that implements the Local Area Transport (LAT)
                      protocol. The server, in turn, uses the same LAT
                      protocol to connect printers to these services.
                      LAT architecture uses Ethernet to make logical
                      connections between printers and service nodes on
                      the same network.

                      When connected to a service, a printer appears
                      to be connected directly to the service node.
                      DECnet is not necessary for VAX/VMS systems to
                      function as LAT service nodes. The DECserver 250
                      unit itself can be configured as a service node,
                      offering either a printer, one dial-out modem, or
                      a console terminal on port 1.

                      Introducing the DECserver 250 Server for Printers



              _____________________________
              1.2.4 LAT Software

                      LAT V5.1 or later is implemented on VAX/VMS
                      nodes. This includes the LTDRIVER, which is
                      a port driver in direct communication with
                      the system's terminal class driver. LTDRIVER
                      implements the protocol necessary to communicate
                      with devices connected to the server and is used
                      in place of a local port driver, such as the
                      DZDRIVER. A LAT Control Program (LATCP) provides
                      the command interface to the LTDRIVER. LATCP
                      can be used to start and stop the driver as well
                      as to set and to display characteristics of the
                      driver.

                      A network node does not need LAT to perform load-
                      host functions, but LAT software is required for
                      a system to offer services as a service node.

                      On remote-access ports, the DECserver 250
                      unit permits VAX/VMS service nodes with this
                      software to make requests for printers on server
                      ports. These requests are called host-initiated
                      requests.

              __________________________________________________________
              1.3 Performing the Software Installation

                      As software installer, you are responsible for
                      three tasks:

                      1  Installing the DECserver 250 distribution
                         software

                      2  Configuring the load host's node database

                      3  Verifying the server system installation, which
                         includes down-line loading the server image to
                         the DECserver and issuing a few server commands
                         at this server.




                                                                     1-3

 





                      Introducing the DECserver 250 Server for Printers




                      Completion of these tasks establishes your VMS
                      system as a load host for one or more servers.
                      A load host is a system that contains the server
                      image and whose node database has entries for
                      specific servers, and as a result, can down-
                      line load the server image to servers on the
                      local Ethernet. In addition, a load host performs
                      maintenance activities such as receiving up-line
                      dumps from the server.

                      A load host can be a single VMS system, or it
                      can be a member node of a VAXcluster. For a
                      VMS system to act as a load host, it must be
                      running DECnet Phase IV, and it must be located
                      on the same Ethernet as the server. For supported
                      version numbers of DECnet software, see the
                      Software Product Description for the DECserver
                      250 product.

                      A load host must have 600 free blocks of disk
                      space for the DECserver 250 distribution files.
                      Another 768 free blocks of disk space is required
                      for each up-line dump.

                      Load hosts are assigned by the network manager.
                      Digital Equipment Corporation advises that you
                      establish more than one system as a load host for
                      each server. Alternate hosts free the server from
                      dependence on one particular load host. For each
                      server, Digital Equipment Corporation suggests
                      a minimum of two load hosts. Digital Equipment
                      Corporation also recommends one load host for
                      every ten servers on a network.

                      When selecting alternate load hosts, you can
                      choose any Digital Equipment Corporation system
                      for which a DECserver 250 distribution kit is
                      available. DECserver 250 software distribution
                      kits are available for these systems:

                      o  VAX/VMS

                      o  ULTRIX-32

                      Introducing the DECserver 250 Server for Printers




                      For information on installing the server
                      distribution software onto another operating
                      system and configuring that system's node
                      database in order to establish it as an alternate
                      load host, see the DECserver 250 software
                      installation guide for that system.

                      In addition to the three tasks just described,
                      you must coordinate the total software
                      installation procedure with both the server
                      hardware installer of new servers and the server
                      manager of existing servers. For example, the
                      software should be installed before the hardware
                      is powered up for the first time. Chapter 4
                      details the coordination necessary between you,
                      the hardware installer, and the server manager.

              _____________________________
              1.3.1 Installing the DECserver 250 Distribution Software

                      You install the server distribution software
                      onto a VMS system with an automated procedure
                      called VMSINSTAL. The DECserver 250 software
                      distribution kit includes a procedure file that
                      VMSINSTAL uses to do the installation. VMSINSTAL
                      does the following:

                      o  Copies the files from the distribution media to
                         the load host.

                      o  Creates the appropriate directory for these
                         files.

                      o  Prints the DECserver 250 Release Notes.
                         VMSINSTAL gives you three choices: (1) Display
                         the release notes, (2) Print the release notes,
                         or (3) Display and print the release notes.

                      See Chapter 2 for instructions on installing the
                      distribution software.

                                             NOTE

                         If you have the Terminal Server Manager
                         (TSM) software, an optional network
                         management product available for VAX/VMS
                         load hosts, read the documentation for this

                                                                     1-5

              1.3.3 Configuring the Load Host's Node Database

                      Once you copy the distribution software to your
                      VMS system, you must configure the system's node
                      database to support new servers. You configure
                      this database with an automated procedure called
                      DSVCONFIG. The DSVCONFIG configuration procedure
                      file is part of the DECserver 250 software
                      distribution kit.

                      Configuration of the load host's node database
                      means defining an entry for each server in three
                      places: (1) a data file called DSVCONFIG.DAT,
                      (2) the DECnet volatile (operational) database,
                      and (3) the DECnet permanent database. The
                      DSVCONFIG.DAT file is the server configuration
                      database. DSVCONFIG.DAT is automatically created
                      by DSVCONFIG and is part of a load host's node
                      database.

                      When you use DSVCONFIG to configure a new
                      server, DSVCONFIG automatically adds an entry
                      in the three places mentioned above. The entry
                      identifies the server type, its DECnet node name
                      and DECnet node address, its service circuit-
                      ID, its Ethernet address, its dump file, and the
                      server image.

                      When you complete the configuration procedure,
                      your VMS system is established as a load host
                      for each server that has an entry in the node
                      database. See Chapter 3 for instructions on
                      configuring the load host's node database to
                      support servers.

                                                                     1-7

                      To configure a server on a VAXcluster, install
                      the distribution software onto one member node,
                      and then configure the node databases of the
                      members that you want to establish as load hosts.
                      See Section 3.7 for details.

                      Besides allowing you to configure a new server in
                      the load host's node database, DSVCONFIG allows
                      you to list all servers currently defined in
                      the DSVCONFIG.DAT file and to restore to the
                      host's DECnet databases all server configurations
                      defined in DSVCONFIG.DAT. Chapter 3 explains how
                      to use these options. Appendix C has examples
                      showing how to use these and two other options:
                      (1) Replacing an existing DECserver unit with
                      a new DECserver 250 unit (or changing the
                      characteristics of an existing unit), and (2)
                      removing a DECserver 250 unit from the node
                      database. Normally you do not use these latter
                      two options during the installation procedure.
                      The DECserver 250 Management Guide explains how
                      to use them.

              _____________________________
              1.3.4 Verifying the Installation

                      After configuring the node database, your final
                      responsibility is to verify the installation.
                      Actually, you need to perform two verifications:

                      1  To verify the installation of the load host,
                         down-line load the server image to a server,
                         and then read the DECnet event-logging
                         messages. Verifying the installation of the
                         load host means checking that this load host:

                         o Has the appropriate files in the correct
                           directory.

                         o Has a correct entry in its node database for
                           the test server.

                         o Can successfully down-line load the server
                           image.

                      2  To verify the total server system installation,
                         test a few server commands at an interactive
                         terminal connected to a server port. Verifying
                         the system installation means checking that:

                                                                     1-9

 





                      Introducing the DECserver 250 Server for Printers






                         o The correct version of the software is in
                           the server.

                         o The server hardware operates with the new
                           software.

                         o The new software is running successfully.

              1.3.4.1 Verifying the Load Host Installation

                      To verify that your VMS system has been
                      successfully established as a load host, use
                      it to perform a down-line load. Down-line
                      loading means sending the server image from an
                      established load host to the server.

                      Use the NCP LOAD NODE command from your VMS load
                      host to down-line load. Then, check the DECnet
                      event-logging messages in order to verify that
                      the load was successful.

              _____________________________
              1.3.4.2 Verifying the Server System Installation

                      Using a few server commands at an interactive
                      terminal attached to a server port completes your
                      verification of the server system installation.

                      See Chapter 4 for details on the two verification
                      procedures. See Appendix A for a list of
                      the DECserver 250 distribution files. See
                      Appendix B for a brief discussion of the Remote
                      Console Facility. Finally, see Appendix C for
                      step-by-step examples of the entire software
                      installation.

              2       Installing the DECserver 250 Distribution
                      Software


                      This chapter describes how to prepare for
                      installation and how to install the DECserver
                      250 distribution software onto your VAX/VMS load
                      host. To install the software, use VMSINSTAL.COM,
                      an automated procedure, which is part of the
                      VAX/VMS operating system.

              __________________________________________________________
              2.1 Overview of VMSINSTAL

                      VMSINSTAL is an interactive procedure that calls
                      and controls the DECserver 250 installation
                      procedure. When you run VMSINSTAL, the following
                      tasks are performed:

                      o  Creation of a directory called
                         SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] on the load host, if
                         necessary

                      o  Copying of the files from the distribution
                         media into this directory

                      o  Printing of a copy of the DECserver 250 Release
                         Notes when you specify OPTIONS N

              __________________________________________________________
              2.2 Preparing to Run the Installation Procedure

                      Before you actually run VMSINSTAL, follow these
                      steps:

                      1  Determine which systems are designated as
                         load hosts for the server. You must install
                         the distribution software onto all of these
                         systems. Ask your network manager or the person
                         responsible for assigning load hosts to tell
                         you which are the designated systems.

                         Note that you do not need a separate license
                         for each load host, but you do need a separate
                         license for each server.

                                                                     2-1

 





                      Installing the DECserver 250 Distribution Software




                      2  Check that there are 600 free blocks of disk
                         space on each load host for copying the
                         distribution files. Another 768 free blocks
                         of disk space are required for each up-line
                         dump.

                      3  Ensure that the network and utility classes are
                         tailored on the load host.

              __________________________________________________________
              2.3 VMSINSTAL Conventions

                      VMSINSTAL is an interactive procedure. When you
                      start VMSINSTAL, a series of questions displays.
                      After each question, the default response, if
                      there is one, displays in brackets  ( [  ] ). At
                      the end of each question, either a colon (:) or a
                      question mark (?) appears.

                      o  To answer a question, type your response
                         immediately after the colon or question mark;
                         then press the RETURN key.

                      o  To respond to a question with the default
                         answer, press only the RETURN key.

                      o  To get help after any question, type a question
                         mark (?). After the help display, the question
                         is repeated.

                      See the VAX/VMS documentation for a complete
                      description of VMSINSTAL.

              __________________________________________________________
              2.4 Running VMSINSTAL

                      Running VMSINSTAL.COM requires the appropriate
                      privileges. To determine what they are, see the
                      system manager.

                      Run VMSINSTAL.COM from the system manager's
                      account. The installation procedure takes
                      approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Follow these
                      steps:

                      1  Place the distribution medium on the
                         appropriate device drive.

                      2-2

 





                      Installing the DECserver 250 Distribution Software




                      2  Log in to the system manager account.

                      3  Start VMSINSTAL with these commands:

                         $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <RET>
                         $ @VMSINSTAL DS25 device-identifier OPTIONS N <RET>

                         Here, DS25 is the VAX/VMS facility code for the
                         DECserver 250 product, and device-identifier
                         is the device on which the distribution medium
                         is mounted. During the procedure, OPTIONS N
                         tells VMSINSTAL to ask if you want to print the
                         DECserver 250 Release Notes.































                                                                     2-3

 





                      Installing the DECserver 250 Distribution Software




                                                NOTE

                           Digital Equipment Corporation recommends
                           that you specify OPTIONS N on the command
                           line. If you do not want to print the
                           release notes or if you are interested in
                           VMSINSTAL's other options, see the VAX/VMS
                           Guide to Software Installation, which is
                           part of the VAX/VMS documentation set.

                         If you are installing onto alternate load hosts
                         with copied Savesets, the VMSINSTAL command
                         line format differs slightly. See the VAX/VMS
                         documentation on VMSINSTAL.

                                                NOTE

                           To abort the installation procedure at
                           any time, press <CTRL/Y>. When you press
                           <CTRL/Y>, the installation procedure
                           deletes all files it has created up
                           to that point and then returns you to
                           DCL level. If you want to retry the
                           installation procedure after pressing
                           <CTRL/Y>, you must invoke VMSINSTAL again.

                         VMSINSTAL displays the procedure title and the
                         date and time. It continues with the following
                         (the warning message appears only if DECnet is
                         running):

                         %VMSINSTAL-W-DECNET, Your DECnet network is up and running.
                         * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

                      4  Type YES and press the RETURN key to proceed
                         with the installation.

                      5  VMSINSTAL asks:

                         * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                      6  If you answer NO, the installation procedure
                         terminates. Take appropriate action and start
                         the procedure again.

                         If backup is satisfactory, press the RETURN key
                         to answer YES.










































                                                                     2-5

 





                      Installing the DECserver 250 Distribution Software




                      7  If you are installing from the distribution
                         media rather than from copied Savesets,
                         VMSINSTAL prompts you to mount the first
                         volume:

                         Please mount the first volume of the set on device-identifier.
                         * Are you ready?

                         Type YES and press the RETURN key. A
                         confirmation message says that the medium is
                         mounted.

                      8  The procedure continues:

                         The following products will be processed:

                                                NOTE

                           DECserver 250 software version numbers
                           are not specified in this manual. For
                           example, the release notes file is shown
                           as DS25nnn.RELEASE_NOTES. Here, nnn
                           represents the version number; if you
                           are installing Version 1.0, the release
                           notes file is DS25010.RELEASE_NOTES.

                      9  Some types of distribution media require
                         several volumes. (More than one distribution
                         medium is delivered with your distribution
                         kit.) For these types of distribution media,
                         the procedure gives you a continuation message
                         and tells you to mount the next volume (each
                         volume is labeled with a volume number):

                         %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on device-identifier: for reading
                         Enter "YES" when ready:

                         Mount the next volume, type YES, and press the
                         RETURN key.

                      Installing the DECserver 250 Distribution Software




                         Select one of these options. Digital Equipment
                         Corporation recommends that you select Option
                         2.

                         o If you select Option 1, you see:

                                VMI$ROOT:[SYSUPD.DS25nnn]DS25nnn.RELEASE_NOTES;1

                           The release notes immediately start
                           scrolling at your terminal.

                                                  NOTE

                              The release notes might contain up to
                              30 pages.

                         o If you select Option 2, VMSINSTAL asks to
                           which queue you want to send the file for
                           printing:

                           * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                           Press the RETURN key to print the release
                           notes on the default printer, or specify
                           another print queue. A message indicates
                           that the system queued the file.

                         o If you select Option 3, VMSINSTAL first asks
                           to which queue you want to send the file for
                           printing:

                           * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                           Press the RETURN key to print the release
                           notes on the default printer, or specify
                           another print queue. A message indicates
                           that the system queued the file for
                           printing. Next, VMSINSTAL displays the
                           release notes:

                           VMI$ROOT:[SYSUPD.DS25nnn]DS25nnn.RELEASE_NOTES

                           The release notes immediately start
                           scrolling at your terminal.

                      11 After the system's queue message and the
                         release notes are displayed (if you selected
                         one of the display options), the procedure
                         continues by asking:

                         * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?

                         Press the RETURN key to stop the procedure and
                         review the release notes. Check for any changes
                         that can affect this installation. (VMSINSTAL
                         places the release notes file, DS25nnn.RELEASE_
                         NOTES, in the SYS$HELP directory.)
































                                                                     2-9

                      12 Run the procedure again when you are ready to
                         continue. Enter this form of the command:

                         $ @VMSINSTAL DS25 device-identifier <RET>

                      13 VMSINSTAL displays the procedure title and the
                         date and time. It continues with the following
                         (the warning message appears only if DECnet is
                         running):

                         %VMSINSTAL-W-DECNET, Your DECnet network is up and running.
                         * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

                         Type YES and press the RETURN key to proceed
                         with the installation.

                      14 VMSINSTAL asks:

                         * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                         Press the RETURN key to answer YES.

                      15 If you are installing from the distribution
                         media rather than from copied Savesets,
                         VMSINSTAL prompts you to mount the first
                         volume:

                         Please mount the first volume of the set on device-identifier.
                         * Are you ready?

                         Type YES and press the RETURN key.

                      16 A confirmation message says that the medium is
                         mounted. The procedure continues:

                         The following products will be processed:

                           DS25 Vn.n

                         * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

                      17 If your distribution media require more
                         than one volume, the procedure gives you a
                         continuation message and tells you to mount
                         the next volume. Each volume is labeled with a
                         volume number.

                      18 If you are on a VAXcluster node, the following
                         message displays:

                         If you intend to execute this layered product on other nodes in your
                         VAXcluster, and you have the appropriate software license, you must
                         prepare the system-specific roots on the other nodes by issuing the
                         following command on each node (using a suitably privileged account):

                         $ CREATE/DIRECTORY SYS$SPECIFIC:[DECSERVER]/PROTECTION=(S:RWED,O:RWED)

                      19 You have finished the first part of the
                         installation. The procedure continues:

                         o It tells you that the installation
                           is complete, meaning that all the
                           distribution files have been copied to their
                           appropriate directories. (See Appendix A
                           for descriptions of the DECserver 250 VMS
                           distribution files.)

                         o It instructs you how to continue.

                         o It mentions the additional software you must
                           install at this time.

                         Your installation is now complete. After exiting from VMSINSTAL:

                         1. Edit your system start-up file so that it defines the logical
                            MOM$LOAD as a search string with a value equal to the current search
                            string plus the added element SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]. For example:

                            DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/NAME_ATTRIBUTE=NO_ALIAS/NOLOG-
                            MOM$LOAD 'current-search-string',SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]

                            If the current search string associated with MOM$LOAD in your
                            start-up file is SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] or if you have
                            already made this change for a previous installation, there
                            is no need to edit this file.

                            This command ensures that the location of the server image
                            is defined each time the system is rebooted, necessary for
                            successful down-line loading.

                         2. Configure the server into your host's database.
                            Execute a command procedure called DSVCONFIG.COM. This
                            command procedure is in the SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] directory.
                            If you have already executed this procedure from previous
                            installations, you need to configure only any additional units.
                            All previously defined units will still be configured.

                           If you are installing files onto a
                           VAXcluster node, the messages indicate
                           that the files are copied to the

                         MOM$LOAD is a logical name that your load host
                         uses to find the image file of any product that
                         must be down-line loaded. For each product,
                         MOM$LOAD has an associated equivalent string
                         that specifies the location of the product's
                         image file. Thus, the following command equates

                      Installing the DECserver 250 Distribution Software




                         If your system is a load host for several
                         products, then the location of each image
                         file must be defined by a list of equivalent
                         strings. For example, the following command
                         defines the location of a LAN Bridge image file
                         as well as the DECserver 250 image file:

                         DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/NAME_ATTRIBUTE=NOALIAS/NOLOG MOM$LOAD -
                         SYS$SYSTEM:[LANBRIDGE],SYS$SYSTEM:[DECSERVER]

                         Two or more equivalence strings make up a
                         search list. When your VAX/VMS system is
                         requested to down-line load a product, it
                         looks through the search list until it finds
                         the location of the product's image file.

                         Your host cannot down-line load the DECserver
                         250 image file unless the search list defined
                         for MOM$LOAD has the correct location of the
                         image file. To see what the current search
                         string is for MOM$LOAD, use the DCL SHOW
                         LOGICAL command:

                         $ SHOW LOGICAL MOM$LOAD <RET>

                         If SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] is defined for
                         MOM$LOAD, you do not have to define MOM$LOAD.
                         Define MOM$LOAD only if:

                         o No equivalent string exists for MOM$LOAD
                           (the SHOW LOGICAL command results with the
                           message, "No translation for logical name
                           MOM$LOAD")

                           or

                         o The equivalent strings defined for MOM$LOAD
                           do not include SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER].

                         If MOM$LOAD is already defined for other
                         products but not for the DECserver 250
                         product, you must define MOM$LOAD by
                         specifying SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] along
                         with the current search string(s), as shown
                         in the VMSINSTAL example. If you specify
                         only SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] for MOM$LOAD
                         excluding the current search string(s),

                         then SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] will replace
                         the current search string(s). Your VAX/VMS
                         system will not be able to load the image files
                         located by the current search string(s).

              2.5 Special Installation Considerations for DSVCONFIG.COM

                      The configuration command procedure,
                      DSVCONFIG.COM, which is part of this distribution
                      kit, accommodates the DECserver 100, DECserver
                      200, DECserver 250, and DECserver 500 products.
                      However, some previous releases of DSVCONFIG.COM
                      cannot accommodate the DECserver 250 and
                      DECserver 500 products. Therefore, for all
                      configurations use the command file on your kit
                      only.

                      When installing new versions of DECserver
                      products, always check the product release notes
                      for information on the latest DSVCONFIG.COM.

              __________________________________________________________
              2.6 Installing onto Alternate Load Hosts

                      Digital Equipment Corporation recommends that you
                      establish alternate load hosts for each server.
                      Alternates free the server from dependence on
                      one particular load host because an alternate
                      load host can perform a down-line load if the
                      original load host is unavailable. In addition,
                      alternate load hosts can receive up-line dumps
                      from servers.

                      Regarding the assignment of load hosts,
                      Digital Equipment Corporation suggests both the
                      following:

                      o  For each server, at least one other load host
                         as a backup to the original.

                      o  At least one load host for every ten servers.

                      Installing the DECserver 250 Distribution Software




                      As with the original load host, an alternate
                      VAX/VMS load host must:

                      o  Be running DECnet Phase IV.

                      o  Have an Ethernet controller on the same
                         Ethernet as the server.

                      o  Have the distribution software installed.



































                                                                    2-19

 





                      Installing the DECserver 250 Distribution Software




                      o  Have DECserver 250 entries in its server
                         configuration database (DSVCONFIG.DAT file),
                         the DECnet operational database, and the DECnet
                         permanent database.

                      o  Have the latest load file (see Chapter 3).

                      o  Have its Ethernet circuit enabled for service.

              _____________________________
              2.6.1 Installing onto Single Systems

                      To install the server distribution software onto
                      an alternate VAX/VMS load host that is not a
                      member of a VAXcluster, use one of these methods:

                      o  If the alternate load host has the same
                         load device as the original host, place your
                         distribution media on the appropriate device of
                         the new load host and repeat the installation
                         procedure detailed in Section 2.4.

                      o  If the alternate load host does not have the
                         same load device as the original host, load and
                         extract the savesets from the kit, using the
                         following procedure:

                         1 Type the following command on the original
                           load host:

                           $SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE: <RET>

                           $@VMSINSTAL DS25 device-identifier OPTIONS G SYS$UPDATE: <RET>

                           Here, DS25 is the VMS four-letter facility
                           code for the DECserver 250 product. OPTIONS
                           G extracts the savesets from the kit.

                         2 Copy the savesets to the alternate load
                           host's SYS$UPDATE directory. The savesets
                           are DS25nnn.A and DS25nnn.B.

                         3 Run VMSINSTAL on the alternate load host:

                           $@VMSINSTAL DS25 SYS$UPDATE: <RET>

              2.6.2 Installing onto VAXclusters

                      To install the server distribution software onto
                      an alternate load host that is a member of a
                      VAXcluster, follow these steps:

                      1  Run DSVCONFIG on all cluster members that are
                         to act as load hosts. (Do not reinstall the
                         software on homogeneous clusters.)

                         The software is installed onto the common
                         cluster disk. Since the distribution files are
                         in SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER], all cluster members
                         have access to them.

                      2  Follow the steps in Section 3.7 to keep
                         accurate each member's three databases for
                         servers.

              2.6.3 Installing onto Other Operating Systems

                      To install the DECserver 250 distribution
                      software onto an operating system other than
                      VAX/VMS, follow the instructions in the DECserver
                      250 Software Installation Guide for that system.
                      You can find the guide for one of the other
                      supported operating systems in the software
                      distribution kit for that operating system.

              2.7 After Exiting VMSINSTAL

                      After you exit VMSINSTAL, follow these steps:

                      1  Check the DECserver 250 Release Notes to see
                         if you have to install any additional software
                         from the distribution media. If so, install
                         those distribution files.

                      2  Give the DECserver 250 Release Notes to the
                         server manager.

                                                                    2-21

              3       Configuring the Load Host's Node Database



                      This chapter explains how to configure a VAX/VMS
                      load host's node database for new servers.
                      Configuring this database is part of the software
                      installation. After this procedure, your VAX/VMS
                      system is established as a valid load host for
                      the new servers.

                      To configure the load host's node database
                      for a new server, use the Add option of
                      DSVCONFIG.COM, an automated, menu-driven
                      procedure. DSVCONFIG.COM prompts you for
                      information about the new server and then
                      configures the load host's node database by
                      adding an entry for the new server to the
                      DSVCONFIG.DAT file (the server configuration
                      database) and the DECnet databases. You also
                      can configure the load host's node database by
                      restoring to the DECnet databases the server
                      entries that exist in the DSVCONFIG.DAT file.

                      If you ran the installation procedure described
                      in Chapter 2, DSVCONFIG.COM is now in the
                      SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] directory for single
                      systems and in SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER] for
                      VAXcluster members. The load host creates and
                      maintains all server-related files in this
                      directory.

                                             NOTE

                         DSVCONFIG.COM, which is part of this
                         distribution kit, accommodates the DECserver
                         100, DECserver 200, DECserver 250 and
                         DECserver 500 products. However, some
                         previous releases of DSVCONFIG.COM do not
                         accommodate the DECserver 250 and DECserver
                         500 products. Therefore, use the command
                         file on this kit for all configurations.

                                                                     3-1

 





                      Configuring the Load Host's Node Database



              __________________________________________________________
              3.1 Overview of DSVCONFIG

                      DSVCONFIG has five configuration options, all
                      of which affect the node database on the load
                      host. When you start the DSVCONFIG procedure, it
                      displays the following menu of options:


                                        DECserver Configuration Procedure

                                                 Menu of Options
                                           1 - List known DECservers
                                           2 - Add a DECserver
                                           3 - Swap an existing DECserver
                                           4 - Delete an existing DECserver
                                           5 - Restore existing DECservers
                                      CTRL/Z - Exit from this procedure


                      To configure your load host's node database
                      for new servers, use the List and Add options.
                      You may also need to use the Restore option
                      (especially for configuring VAXcluster nodes).
                      This chapter discusses these three options only.
                      The Swap and Delete options are used by the
                      server manager. The Swap option is recommended
                      when the server hardware unit malfunctions and
                      must be replaced. The Delete option is useful
                      when reconfiguring the network or changing load
                      hosts for a server. Examples showing the uses
                      of these options are included in Appendix C. For
                      more information on these options and DSVCONFIG,
                      see the DECserver 250 Management Guide.

                      This section discusses the databases that the
                      DSVCONFIG options affect. Subsequent sections
                      explain how to:

                      o  Specify DECnet characteristics during DSVCONFIG
                         (Section 3.2).

                      o  Prepare for running DSVCONFIG (Section 3.3).

                      o  Respond to DSVCONFIG and comply with its
                         requirements (Section 3.4).

                      o  Start DSVCONFIG and use the List, Add, and
                         Restore options (Section 3.5).

                      o  Start DSVCONFIG with the RESTORE parameter
                         to restore your local DECnet database
                         (Section 3.6).

                      o  Configure VAXcluster nodes using DSVCONFIG
                         (Section 3.7).

                      o  Exit from DSVCONFIG (Section 3.8).

                      See the DECserver 250 Management Guide for a
                      complete description of DSVCONFIG.

              _____________________________
              3.1.1 Databases Affected by DSVCONFIG

                      The DSVCONFIG procedure operates on three
                      distinct databases contained in the load host's
                      node database:

                      1  The server configuration database for
                         servers. This database is stored in the file
                         DSVCONFIG.DAT. It has the information you
                         see when you select Option 1, List, from the
                         DSVCONFIG Menu.

                      2  The operational host DECnet database.

                      3  The permanent host DECnet database.

                      When you run DSVCONFIG, server information is
                      transferred from the DSVCONFIG database to the
                      DECnet database. These two databases must remain
                      synchronized.

                      The DSVCONFIG procedure automatically keeps these
                      databases synchronized on the load host. Though
                      DSVCONFIG includes several NCP commands, do not
                      execute these commands yourself to configure the
                      load host's node database. NCP affects only the
                      DECnet databases.

                                                                     3-3

 





                      Configuring the Load Host's Node Database




                      On a VAXcluster load host, the DSVCONFIG
                      procedure automatically synchronizes the
                      databases on the load host but not on the other
                      members of the VAXcluster. Section 3.7 explains
                      how to configure VAXcluster nodes so that the
                      databases are synchronized on all members.

              _____________________________
              3.1.2 DSVCONFIG Options for the Software Installer

                      As a software installer, use the List, Add, and
                      Restore DSVCONFIG options for new servers.

                      1  List known DECservers-Lists servers that are
                         currently defined in DSVCONFIG.DAT.

                      2  Add a DECserver-Adds an entry for a new server
                         in DSVCONFIG.DAT and in the DECnet databases.

                         Adding an entry supplies information that
                         identifies the server on the Ethernet, thus
                         establishing this system as a load host for the
                         new server.

                      3  Restore existing DECservers - Restores servers
                         that exist in the DSVCONFIG.DAT file to the
                         load host's DECnet operational database and
                         DECnet permanent database.

                         This option copies server entries from
                         DSVCONFIG.DAT to the DECnet databases. For
                         example, if the load host system is brought
                         down, server entries may not be automatically
                         restored to the DECnet databases when the
                         system comes up again, especially if a central
                         node database is used with NCP. Because server
                         entries remain intact in the DSVCONFIG.DAT
                         file, you can use the Restore option to copy
                         these server entries to the DECnet databases.

              3.2 Specifying DECnet Characteristics During DSVCONFIG

                      Several DECnet characteristics apply to servers.
                      DECnet uses these characteristics for down-
                      line loading and up-line dumping. For each new
                      server, you must specify some of the following
                      characteristics; DSVCONFIG supplies the others
                      automatically.

                      The DECserver 250 information that you must
                      specify is recorded on each unit's DECserver 250
                      Identification Card. Ask the hardware installer
                      or the network manager for this card.

              _____________________________
              3.2.1 DECnet Node Name

                      Each DECserver 250 unit must have a unique
                      DECnet node name. This name must have from 1
                      to 6 alphanumeric characters with at least one
                      character being an alphabetic character. For
                      example, DSV25 and LION77 are valid DECnet node
                      names.

                      The network manager assigns DECnet node names.
                      During the hardware installation, the hardware
                      installer records the DECnet node name on the
                      DECserver 250 Identification Card for each
                      server.

                                                                     3-5

 





                      Configuring the Load Host's Node Database




                      DSVCONFIG does not set up the server name on
                      the server itself. The server name, a server
                      characteristic stored in the server's databases,
                      must be defined on the server by the server
                      manager. To avoid confusion, the server name
                      should match the DECnet node name.

              _____________________________
              3.2.2 DECnet Node Address

                      Each DECserver 250 unit has a unique DECnet node
                      address. This number must be a decimal number
                      from 1 to 1023.

                      If your DECnet network is divided into areas,
                      each DECnet node address takes the form aa.nnnn.
                      Here, aa is a decimal area number from 2 to
                      63, nnnn is the node address, and the period
                      distinguishes area from address. For example,
                      17.1003 is a valid node address.

                      The network manager assigns DECnet node
                      addresses. During the hardware installation,
                      the hardware installer records the DECnet node
                      address on the DECserver 250 Identification Card
                      for each server.

              _____________________________
              3.2.3 Ethernet Address

                      Each DECserver 250 unit is delivered with a
                      unique Ethernet hardware address. This address
                      is six pairs of hexadecimal digits with a hyphen
                      (-) separating each pair. For example, 08-00-01-
                      00-AB-CD is an address with a valid format.

                      The Ethernet address is on the control/indicator
                      panel of the DECserver 250 unit. During the
                      hardware installation, the hardware installer
                      records the Ethernet address on each unit's
                      DECserver 250 Identification Card.

              _____________________________
              3.2.4 Server Type

                      The server type that you specify is "DS250",
                      which defines your unit as a DECserver 250
                      server.

              _____________________________
              3.2.5 Load File (Server Image File)

                      The DECserver 250 load file is the server's
                      software image that is down-line loaded by the
                      host to the server. You do not have to supply
                      this information.

                      The name of the DECserver 250 load file is
                      DP0601ENG.SYS.

              _____________________________
              3.2.6 Dump File Name

                      Each server has a unique dump file name, DP2node-
                      name.DMP. Here, node-name is the DECnet node name
                      of the server. For example, a DECserver 250 unit
                      with the DECnet node name TIGER has the dump file
                      name DP2TIGER.DMP.

                      You do not have to supply the dump file name.
                      When you use the Add option to define a new
                      DECserver 250 unit, DSVCONFIG assigns a name
                      for the dump file. See the DECserver 250 Problem
                      Determination Guide for information on up-line
                      dumping, the creation of the server's up-line
                      dump file, and using this file for problem
                      analysis.

              _____________________________
              3.2.7 Service Circuit

                      The service circuit is the Ethernet circuit that
                      the load host uses to reach the server when
                      loading and dumping occur. The load host may
                      have more than one active Ethernet circuit, so
                      you have to specify the service circuit ID to
                      identify which circuit is to be used for loads
                      and dumps. The service circuit ID is stored in
                      the load host's DECnet databases.

                                                                     3-7

 





                      Configuring the Load Host's Node Database




                      DSVCONFIG prepares your node as a load host by
                      enabling SERVICE on the service circuit. SERVICE
                      must be enabled before a down-line load can
                      occur.

                      When you run DSVCONFIG to add more than one
                      unit, the procedure asks you to specify the
                      service circuit each time. The first time you
                      are asked, the default is the service circuit
                      for the processor type of your VAX/VMS load host.
                      If you respond by specifying a different service
                      circuit, that response becomes the default until
                      either you specify another service circuit or you
                      exit the procedure.

              3.3 Preparing to Run the Configuration Procedure

                      Before beginning the configuration procedure:

                      1  Check that DECnet Phase IV is installed and
                         running. For information about DECnet Phase
                         IV, see the VAX/VMS DECnet-VAX System Manager's
                         Guide.

                                                                     3-9

                      2  Check that all the distribution software was
                         installed in these directories:

                         o SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] for single systems

                         o SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER] for VAXclusters

                         See Appendix A for a list of the distribution
                         files.

                      3  Check that each new server's DECnet node name
                         and node address are unique.

                         Ask the hardware installer for the DECserver
                         250 Identification Card for each new DECserver
                         250 unit. The network manager and the hardware
                         installer recorded the server's DECnet node
                         name and node address as well as the Ethernet
                         address on this card. You need to know the
                         server's DECnet node name, DECnet node address,
                         and Ethernet address to answer prompts during
                         DSVCONFIG.

                         You can check the uniqueness of the server's
                         DECnet node address and node name by specifying
                         the address or name with the NCP SHOW NODE
                         command:

                         $ MCR NCP <RET>
                         NCP>SHOW NODE node-name CHARACTERISTICS <RET>

                         or

                         NCP>SHOW NODE node-number CHARACTERISTICS <RET>

                         If NCP shows a node already defined, see the
                         network manager to resolve the conflict in
                         names.

              3.4 DSVCONFIG Conventions and Requirements

                      DSVCONFIG is an interactive procedure. When you
                      start DSVCONFIG, a menu of options displays.
                      Within the Add option, you get a series of
                      questions. After each question, the default
                      response, if there is one, displays in brackets
                      ([  ]). At the end of each question, either a
                      colon (:) or a question mark (?) appears. The
                      following list tells you how to use DSVCONFIG:

                      o  To select an option, type a menu number and
                         press the RETURN key.

                      o  To answer a question, type your response
                         immediately after the colon or question mark,
                         and press the RETURN key.

                      o  To respond to a question with the default
                         answer, press only the RETURN key.

                      o  To get help after any question, type a question
                         mark (?). After the help display, the question
                         is repeated.

                      o  To exit an option without making any changes,
                         type <CTRL/Z>. You are returned to the
                         DSVCONFIG Menu.

                      o  To exit DSVCONFIG at the menu level, type
                         <CTRL/Z>. You are returned to the DCL prompt.

                      DSVCONFIG has some additional conventions and
                      requirements:

                      o  When you finish an option, DSVCONFIG
                         automatically returns you to the DSVCONFIG
                         Menu.

                      o  At the end of the Add option, you might get
                         NCP messages (information, confirmations,
                         and errors). In the case of error messages,
                         the operation might not have been successful.
                         For the meanings of these messages, see the
                         VAX/VMS System Messages and Recovery Procedures
                         Reference Manual.

                                                                    3-11

 





                      Configuring the Load Host's Node Database




                      o  For you to run DSVCONFIG on a particular
                         VAX/VMS load host, the distribution software
                         must already be installed onto that system.

              __________________________________________________________
              3.5 Running DSVCONFIG

                      To run DSVCONFIG.COM, you need OPER and SYSPRV
                      privileges. To start DSVCONFIG:

                      1  Log in to the system account or any account
                         with OPER and SYSPRV privileges.

                      2  Enter the following commands:

                         $ SET DEFAULT MOM$LOAD <RET>
                         $ @DSVCONFIG <RET>

                                                NOTE

                           The latter command assumes you have
                           defined MOM$LOAD to locate the
                           DECserver 250 software image in
                           SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]. See Section 2.4.

                         DSVCONFIG starts with these actions:

                         o It determines whether the DECnet key is
                           installed. If DECnet is missing, DSVCONFIG
                           prints a message and exits. You must have
                           DECnet to run this procedure.

                         o It checks the existence and format of a
                           data file called DSVCONFIG.DAT. It finds one
                           of three possible situations and continues
                           accordingly:

                           a. The DSVCONFIG.DAT file does not exist in
                              SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]. The procedure
                              creates DSVCONFIG.DAT and displays a
                              message telling you that the file was
                              not found and a new one was created.

                           b. SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] already has this
                              file, formatted correctly. This is the
                              case if DSVCONFIG was previously used to

                      3-12

 





                      Configuring the Load Host's Node Database




                              add DECserver 250 entries. The procedure
                              continues with its next task.

                           c. SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] (or for
                              VAXclusters, SYS$SPECIFIC:[DECSERVER])
                              already has this file, but not in the
                              correct format. The procedure reformats
                              the file. Regarding VAXclusters,
                              SYS$SPECIFIC:[DECSERVER] on each
                              VAXcluster node may have an older version
                              of the DSVCONFIG.DAT file. The DSVCONFIG
                              procedure copies the server entries from
                              that data file into the DSVCONFIG.DAT file
                              on SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER], a directory
                              shared by the VAXcluster nodes. The
                              procedure renames the DSVCONFIG.DAT file
                              in SYS$SPECIFIC so that the DSVCONFIG.DAT
                              file in SYS$COMMON is used thereafter.

                                                  NOTE

                              On VAXclusters, DSVCONFIG creates
                              and writes files in the common area,
                              SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER]. See Section 3.7
                              for special instructions on running
                              DSVCONFIG for the first time on
                              VAXclusters.

                         o It informs you that each DECserver unit must
                           have a unique DECnet node name and DECnet
                           node address.

                         o It asks you either to continue or to exit:

                           Press <RET> to start, or <CTRL/Z> to exit...

                         Press the RETURN key if you have the
                         information you need for each new server.

                      and the DECnet permanent database. To create an
                      entry, you must supply:


                      o  The DECserver type

                      o  A unique DECnet node name for the DECserver
                         unit

                      o  A unique DECnet node address for the DECserver

                         circuit is the same as the circuit that
                         connects the load host to the same Ethernet
                         as the server. If not, specify the service-
                         circuit ID of the desired Ethernet controller:

                         o UNA-n     for DEUNA or DELUA

                         o QNA-n    for DEQNA, DELQA, DESQA

                         o BNT-n    for DEBNA, DEBNT

                         o SVA-n    for DESVA

                         Here, n is an integer (typically 0 or 1).
                         See Section 3.2.7 for a discussion of service
                         circuits.

                         DSVCONFIG adds the entry for the new server to
                         the databases and sets SERVICE ENABLED on the
                         specified service circuit, both of which are
                         necessary for down-line loading.

                                            CAUTION

                         If you get an error from DECnet while you
                         are adding a server, the entry is added to
                         the DSVCONFIG.DAT file even though it is not
                         entered in the DECnet databases. To correct
                         this synchronization problem, follow these
                         steps:

                         1 Use Option 4 to delete the entry. (See
                           the example in Appendix C, or refer to the
                           DECserver 250 Management Guide.)

                         2 Fix the condition causing the DECnet
                           error.

                         3 Return to Option 2 to add the server again
                           with the correct information.

                                                                    3-17

                         If you specify a node address that is
                         already defined in DSVCONFIG.DAT, you get
                         a DSVCONFIG error, nothing is added, and the

              _____________________________
              3.5.3 Restore Existing DECservers (Option 5)

                      Select Option 5 to restore your system's
                      DECnet databases to include the servers in
                      DSVCONFIG.DAT. The Restore option affects both
                      the operational and permanent DECnet databases.
                      It performs NCP SET and NCP DEFINE commands.

                      If your DECnet network contains a large number
                      of nodes, you might store your DECnet database on
                      a central remote node and copy this database
                      upon each system startup. However, if many
                      servers exist on the network, Digital Equipment
                      Corporation advises against defining these
                      servers in that central database.

                      If servers are not defined in the central
                      database, you must restore them whenever you
                      copy your local DECnet database from the central
                      DECnet database. Each time you copy the central
                      DECnet database, use Option 5 to restore existing
                      server configurations.

                      Type 5 and press the RETURN key. The following
                      messages confirm the restoration:

                      Restoring existing DECservers to host DECnet database...
                      Host DECnet database successfully restored.

              __________________________________________________________
              3.6 Restoring with the RESTORE Parameter and from Your
                  Start-up Procedure

                      There is another way, which can be automated, to
                      restore your local DECnet database. Run DSVCONFIG
                      with the RESTORE parameter:

                      $ @DSVCONFIG RESTORE <RET>

                      Using RESTORE bypasses the menu and lets you
                      include this restoration in your system start-up
                      procedures. If you want to restore servers to
                      the DECnet database at system startup, edit your

                                                                    3-19

                      system start-up file. Then edit your start-up
                      procedure so that it follows this sequence:


                      1  Starts DECnet.

                      2  Defines all DECnet node names.

                      3  Restores servers. Use the following command in
                         the start-up file:

                         $ @SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]DSVCONFIG RESTORE

                      Configuring the Load Host's Node Database




                      For VAXcluster nodes, a fourth step is sometimes
                      required. For each node that has a different
                      service circuit ID from the rest of the nodes on
                      the cluster, add another line to your start-up
                      procedure:

                      @SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER]DSVCONFIG SET_CIRCUIT
                      service-circuit-ID

                      See Section 3.2.7 for a list of valid service
                      circuit IDs.

                      The SET_CIRCUIT parameter is similar to the
                      RESTORE parameter, but SET_CIRCUIT affects
                      only the DECnet operational (not the permanent)
                      database. This parameter ensures the correct
                      definitions for service circuit IDs for each
                      node after a cluster reboot. DSVCONFIG RESTORE
                      and DSVCONFIG SET_CIRCUIT also turn on all the
                      specified service circuits.

              3.7 Configuring on VAXcluster Nodes

                      For VAXcluster nodes as load hosts, you must
                      keep up to date each node's databases. The
                      procedure you should follow depends on whether
                      you are running for the first time the version
                      of DSVCONFIG in your DECserver 250 software
                      distribution kit.

              _____________________________
              3.7.1 Running DSVCONFIG for the First Time

                      Older versions of DSVCONFIG place DSVCONFIG.DAT
                      in the SYS$SPECIFIC directory. When you run
                      the version of DSVCONFIG in your DECserver 250
                      software distribution kit for the first time,
                      follow this procedure to ensure that DSVCONFIG
                      updates the DSVCONFIG.DAT file correctly and
                      places it in the SYS$COMMON directory:

                      1  Run DSVCONFIG at one node to add servers.
                         DSVCONFIG looks for the original DSVCONFIG.DAT
                         in the SYS$SPECIFIC directory.

                                                                    3-21

 





                      Configuring the Load Host's Node Database




                         Finding an existing DSVCONFIG.DAT file,
                         DSVCONFIG copies the server entries from
                         that data file into the DSVCONFIG.DAT file
                         on SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER], ignoring any servers
                         with names already existing in the SYS$COMMON
                         file. The procedure looks at each entry in
                         SYS$SPECIFIC and determines if that entry
                         is already in SYS$COMMON. If the entry is in
                         SYS$COMMON, it is not merged. If the entry is
                         not in SYS$COMMON, it is merged.

                      Configuring the Load Host's Node Database




                         Then, DSVCONFIG renames the old DSVCONFIG.DAT
                         file on the SYS$SPECIFIC directory to
                         DSVCONFIG_SPECIFIC.DAT. As a result, you still
                         have the original entries in case you need to
                         repeat the merge.

                      2  At every other node, run DSVCONFIG and select
                         the List option. DSVCONFIG merges all the
                         existing server entries to the DSVCONFIG.DAT
                         file in SYS$COMMON.

                      3  Verify that the merge was successful. The list
                         should display the correct service circuit IDs
                         at each node. Since the individual nodes have
                         the correct service circuit ID for each server
                         entry, the correct IDs are merged into the new
                         file. Informational messages display the status
                         of the merge as it progresses.

                         After you verify that the merge is successful,
                         delete the DSVCONFIG_SPECIFIC.DAT file.

                         If the service circuit IDs are not correct for
                         a particular node, you can correct them in one
                         of two ways. You can run DSVCONFIG at the node
                         with the errors. Use the Swap option to change
                         the service circuit IDs, or run DSVCONFIG SET_
                         CIRCUIT at that node (for VAXclusters, the
                         latter method is better).

                         The following example shows the messages
                         DSVCONFIG displays as it merges old server
                         entries:

                      $ @DSVCONFIG <RET>

                      Merging SYS$SPECIFIC:[DECSERVER]DSVCONFIG into SYS$Common:[DECSERVER])DSVCONFIG

                      8 servers were defined in SYS$SPECIFIC:[DECSERVER]DSVCONFIG.DAT
                      3 servers were already in SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER]DSVCONFIG.DAT
                      5 servers merged into SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER]DSVCONFIG.DAT

                      You must assign a unique DECnet node  name  and  DECnet  node
                      address for each new DECserver unit.

                      Press <RET> to start, or <CTRL/Z> to exit...

                                                                    3-23

              3.7.2 Running This Version of DSVCONFIG Again

                      To establish the system as a load host
                      immediately and make additional configuration
                      changes for servers, run DSVCONFIG at each node
                      and select the appropriate options. Running
                      DSVCONFIG at each node ensures correct service
                      circuit IDs. Use the Restore option at each node.
                      This option restores the server's DSVCONFIG.DAT
                      definitions into each node's NCP database.

                      You do not have to perform the procedure at
                      each node if you can wait for the next reboot
                      of the system before it can act as a load host.
                      At reboot, the start-up procedures correct all
                      service circuit IDs for each node.

              __________________________________________________________
              3.8 Exiting DSVCONFIG

                      When you exit DSVCONFIG:

                      1  Give the server manager the DECserver 250
                         Identification Card for each server that you
                         defined.

                      2  Ask the server manager to store the card in
                         the binder for the DECserver 250 software
                         documentation set.

              __________________________________________________________
              3.9 After Exiting DSVCONFIG

                      After you complete the configuration procedure,
                      verify the load host installation. See Chapter 4
                      for details of this procedure.

              4       Verifying the Installation



                      To complete the software installation, you need
                      to perform two verifications. First, verify the
                      load host installation by down-line loading the
                      server image. Then, after loading the server,
                      verify the server system installation. Here,
                      system installation means the installation of
                      the complete server system-the hardware unit
                      with the correct software loaded and running. You
                      verify the server system by testing a few server
                      commands at an interactive terminal, which must
                      be connected to the server on port 1. Printers
                      can be tested by using the TEST PORT command on
                      the DECserver 250.

              __________________________________________________________
              4.1 Verifying the Load Host Installation

                      To verify the installation of the load
                      host, use it to down-line load the server
                      image to one DECserver 250 unit; then, read
                      the DECnet event-logging messages. The
                      messages confirm that the new load host:

                      o  Has the appropriate files in the correct
                         directory

                      o  Has a correct entry in its node database for
                         the server

                      o  Can successfully down-line load the server
                         image to the server

                      Even though there are several ways to down-line
                      load the server image, use the NCP LOAD NODE
                      command to verify the installation, as explained
                      later in this section. This is the only method
                      that tests the installation of the software from
                      a specific load host. The LOAD NODE command lets

                                                                     4-1

 





                      Verifying the Installation




                      you specify the load host, ensuring that the load
                      host doing the down-line load is your VMS system.
                      (A discussion of all the ways to down-line load
                      appears in the DECserver 250 Management Guide.)

                      You can down-line load the new server image
                      to a new server or to an existing server that
                      is currently operating on the network. Each
                      situation has its own requirements, as explained
                      in the following sections.

              _____________________________
              4.1.1 If You Are Loading a New Server

                      A new server has no operating software in it
                      until the initial down-line load, which occurs
                      automatically upon server start-up. When the
                      hardware installer powers up a unit, the server
                      automatically requests a load of its image from
                      any available load host. An established load host
                      recognizes the request and down-line loads the
                      server image.

                      The hardware installer can then verify the
                      hardware installation by checking the appropriate
                      diagnostic lights (LEDs) on the DECserver
                      hardware unit. However, if the server image
                      cannot be properly down-line loaded when the
                      server is powered up, the LEDs on the server
                      hardware unit will indicate server errors.
                      Therefore, your coordination with the server
                      hardware installer is important. Complete the
                      entire software installation procedure before the
                      hardware is powered up for the first time.

                      Note that this automatic down-line load verifies
                      the hardware, but it is not sufficient for
                      verifying the load host installation.

              4.1.2 If You Are Loading an Existing Server

                      When an operating server is loaded, all sessions
                      with service nodes are disconnected. Therefore,
                      if an existing server is about to be loaded
                      with a new image, your coordination with the
                      server manager is important. Digital Equipment
                      Corporation recommends that you talk with the
                      server manager and the system manager about the
                      needs of their users. It may be best to delay the
                      verification of the installation and to down-line
                      load during off-hours.

                      Ask the server manager of an existing server
                      to alert the interactive users on the server of
                      the shutdown for reloading. The server manager
                      should have at least 30 minutes notice to disable
                      connections and queuing to local services of
                      the server, if necessary. (The DECserver 250
                      Management Guide discusses shutting down the
                      server.)

              _____________________________
              4.1.2.1 Loading During Off-Hours

                      To be least disruptive to the users affected
                      by the server, you and the server manager can
                      perform the down-line load during off-hours . To
                      do so, you can put the LOAD command in a batch
                      job and run it at night.

              _____________________________
              4.1.3 Down-Line Loading with the LOAD Command

                      Down-line loading the server image for load
                      host verification involves three steps:

                      1  Follow the steps listed in the next section
                         ("Preparing for the LOAD Command").

                      2  Issue the LOAD command.

                      3  Read the event-logging message that reports the
                         down-line load.

                                                                     4-3

              _____________________________
              4.1.3.1 Preparing for the LOAD Command

                      To prepare for down-line loading:

                      1  Check the DECnet node name or DECnet node
                         address of the server. To execute the LOAD
                         command, you need to know one of these
                         node identifiers. If you do not remember
                         this information from running the DSVCONFIG
                         procedure (see Chapter 3), run the procedure
                         again and select the List option from the menu.
                         The List option displays the DECnet node name
                         and DECnet node address of all the servers you
                         defined in this load host's node database.

                      2  Ask the server manager for the server's
                         DECnet service password if there is one (the
                         server manager may know it as the "maintenance
                         password"). For a previously configured server,
                         you may need to specify this password on the
                         LOAD NODE command line.

                      3  Enable DECnet event logging. Event-logging
                         messages are generated by the Network Control
                         Program (NCP). Enter these commands:

                         $ MCR NCP <RET>
                         NCP> SET LOGGING CONSOLE EVENT 0.3,7 <RET>
                         NCP> SET LOGGING CONSOLE STATE ON <RET>
                         NCP> SET LOGGING MONITOR STATE ON <RET>

                      Verifying the Installation




                         DECnet uses the Operator Communication (OPCOM)
                         facility to display event messages on the
                         operator's console. Make sure OPCOM is running
                         on your host. The DCL SHOW SYSTEM command
                         displays the status of all processes on your
                         system. If OPCOM is not running, start it with
                         the following command:

                         $@SYS$SYSTEM:STARTUP OPCOM <RET>

                                             NOTE

                         All the other commands needed for down-
                         line loading are part of DSVCONFIG and are
                         executed when you run that procedure (see
                         Chapter 3). In addition, SERVICE must be
                         enabled on the service circuit, which is
                         also performed by DSVCONFIG.

              _____________________________
              4.1.3.2 Issuing the LOAD Command

                      After warning interactive users of an operating
                      server and after enabling event logging, you
                      are ready to load the server. Issue the LOAD
                      NODE command at a terminal connected to your VMS
                      load host. On the command line, enter either the
                      DECnet node name or the DECnet node number. The
                      following example loads an existing server named
                      BEETHO, with a node address of 28.1002.

                      $ MCR NCP <RET>
                      NCP> LOAD NODE BEETHO <RET>

                      or

                      NCP> LOAD NODE 28.1002 <RET>

                      If the server manager previously set a server
                      maintenance password, you have to include the
                      SERVICE PASSWORD keywords and specify this
                      password as the DECnet service password on the
                      command line. For example:

                      NCP> LOAD NODE BEETHO SERVICE PASSWORD 0F23 <RET>

                                                                     4-5

              _____________________________
              4.1.3.3 Using DECnet Event Logging

                      After you have executed the LOAD command, check
                      the DECnet event-logging messages that report the
                      load to confirm that it was successful. Read the
                      event-logging messages at your system operator's
                      console. These messages identify your VMS system
                      as the node that generated the event.

                      If no errors are reported, you can assume
                      that the down-line load was successful. You
                      have finished verifying the new load host. See
                      Appendix C for an example of DECnet event logging
                      after a successful down-line load.

                      If you do see errors on the event-logging
                      messages, contact the server hardware
                      installer. Check that the hardware is working
                      satisfactorily. If it is, the problem is probably
                      with the load host. Check your node database,
                      especially the Ethernet address you entered
                      when you defined the test server. Check that the
                      server image is in the appropriate directory.
                      Check that DECnet is running. Try the LOAD
                      command again.

                                             NOTE

                         When event logging is set up on a DECnet
                         node, you can specify the destination
                         (called the sink) of the messages. Digital
                         Equipment Corporation suggests that you
                         set up one DECnet sink node to receive all
                         the logging events associated with down-
                         line loading. In this way, all load request
                         status information is available at one node.

              __________________________________________________________
              4.2 Verifying the Server System Installation

                      To verify the total server system
                      installation, test a few server commands at
                      an interactive terminal connected to port 1,
                      the console port. This step confirms that:

                                                                     4-7

                           Be sure that the software version number
                           and base-level number (BLnn) match those
                           shown here; otherwise, you might be
                           running old software.

                      2  Read the identification message to ensure
                         that the correct version of the server
                         image was down-line loaded. If you fail to
                         receive this display, the problem could be:

                         o With the load host

                         o With the software (incorrect software was
                           down-line loaded

                      3  Enter your user name (any string of 1 through
                         16 characters that identifies you) and press
                         the RETURN key. The port should now enter local
                         mode, where the local prompt (Local>) appears:

                         Enter username> SWINSTALLER <RET>

                                                                     4-9

 





                      Verifying the Installation




                      4  Use the TEST PORT command, which verifies
                         whether the terminal is receiving valid
                         character data. On the command line specify
                         the number of lines and the number of columns
                         you want displayed. For example, this command
                         displays 5 lines of 80 characters each:

                         Local> TEST PORT COUNT 5 WIDTH 80 <RET>

                         Note that you can interrupt this test by
                         pressing any key. Appendix C shows an example
                         of a TEST PORT display.

                      5  Issue the SHOW PORT command to display the
                         characteristics of port 1:

                         Local> SHOW PORT <RET>>

                         A port-characteristics display should appear.
                         Appendix C shows an example of a port-
                         characteristics display.

                      6  Use the SHOW SERVICES command to show what
                         services are available to you. The following
                         server command produces a list of services and
                         service announcements:

                         Local> SHOW SERVICES <RET>

                         Appendix C shows an example of a SHOW SERVICES
                         display.

                      7  Select an available service that you are
                         authorized to use. Use the CONNECT command
                         to verify that the server can logically connect
                         your device to that service. On the command
                         line, specify the service name to which you
                         want to connect. The following example connects
                         your terminal to a VMS system, named SYSTEM:

                         Local> CONNECT SYSTEM <RET>

                         When the server successfully connects your
                         terminal to the service specified, you no
                         longer see the local prompt; rather, you
                         are communicating with the service (in this
                         example, your own VMS system).

                      Verifying the Installation




                      8  Log in to the system and enter several commands
                         to verify the ability of the server to exchange
                         data with the service. In this case, you could
                         enter LOGIN, SHOW TIME, and SHOW USERS.

                      9  Press the BREAK key or log out from the service
                         to return to local mode. Note that pressing the
                         BREAK key does not end the service session you
                         started.



































                                                                    4-11

 





                      Verifying the Installation




                      10 Log out the terminal from the server:

                         Local> LOGOUT <RET>

                      If the server system verification encounters any
                      problem, see the server manager.

                      If you complete the above steps successfully, the
                      test server is operating correctly, and you can
                      report the successful load host installation and
                      the server system installation to the server
                      manager. If this installation is a software
                      upgrade, either you or the server manager must
                      now reload all existing servers.

              4.3 Determining and Reporting Problems

                      If an error occurs while the DECserver 250 is
                      being used, and you believe the error is caused
                      by a problem with the DECserver 250 hardware or
                      software, take one of the following actions:

                      o  Consult the DECserver 250 Problem Determination
                         Guide that came with your DECserver 250 and
                         take the appropriate actions as outlined in the
                         guide; the error may be user correctable.

                      o  If you have a BASIC System Support or DECsystem
                         Support Agreement, you should call your Digital
                         Customer Support Center. With these services,
                         you receive telephone support that provides
                         high-level advisory and remedial assistance
                         for both the hardware and software. On-site
                         hardware support will be provided, if required.
                         Access to Digital Equipment Corporation's
                         Software Information Network (DSIN) is also
                         provided.

                      o  If you purchased the DECserver 250 within the
                         past (1) year, and you think the problem is
                         caused by a software error, you can submit an
                         SPR. If you feel the problem is the hardware,
                         return the DECserver 250 to your local Digital
                         Servicenter for repair.

              B       Using the Remote Console Facility



                      The DECserver 250 unit supports the VMS Remote
                      Console Facility (RCF). This appendix explains
                      how to use RCF from a VMS host. If you issue the
                      BROADCAST command yourself to warn users of an
                      upcoming down-line load, you may want to use RCF.

                      To connect to the server with RCF, use the
                      CONNECT NODE command. On the command line,
                      specify either the DECnet node name or DECnet
                      node address of the server. This example shows a
                      connection to the server named BEETHO:

                      $ MCR NCP  <RET>
                      NCP> CONNECT NODE BEETHO SERVICE PASSWORD 0F23 <RET>
                      Console connected (press CTRL/D when finished)

                      or

                      NCP> CONNECT NODE 28.1002 SERVICE PASSWORD 0F23 <RET>
                      Console connected (press CTRL/D when finished)

                      Press the RETURN key to start the login sequence
                      for the remote console. Log-in password
                      protection is enabled for the DECserver 250
                      remote console port. Therefore, you must supply
                      the login password when the server prompts you
                      with a pound sign (#) as shown below (an audible
                      beep signal accompanies the prompt). The default
                      password is ACCESS.

                       #

                      The prompt indicates that the link to the server
                      has been made. After you enter the correct
                      password, you can begin using DECserver 250
                      commands.


                                                                     B-1

 





                      Using the Remote Console Facility




                      You can also use the CONNECT command with the
                      server's Ethernet address. The following example
                      shows a connection from a VMS system with the
                      service circuit-ID UNA-0 to a server with the
                      Ethernet address 08-00-2B-04-AA-2B:

                      NCP> CONNECT VIA UNA-0 PHYSICAL ADD 08-00-2B-04-AA-2B <RET>





































                      B-2

 





                      Using the Remote Console Facility




                      You may have to specify the service password with
                      the CONNECT command if a maintenance password is
                      specified on the server. To do so, include the
                      SERVICE PASSWORD keywords on your command line
                      and specify the password.

                      To exit from RCF, type <CTRL/D>:

                      Local> <CTRL/D> <RET>

                      To exit from NCP, type EXIT:

                      NCP> EXIT <RET>
                      $

                                             NOTE

                         If you log out from the server with a LOGOUT
                         command, the port is logged out but the
                         remote console session remains active. Type
                         <CTRL/D> to exit the remote console session.

                      The service node prompt reappears, and control
                      passes back to NCP on your VMS system. See the
                      DECserver 250 Management Guide for detailed
                      information on RCF.

                      1. Edit your system start-up file so that it defines the logical
                         MOM$LOAD as a search string with a value equal to the current search
                         string, plus the added element SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER].  For example:

                         DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/NAME_ATTRIBUTE=NO_ALIAS/NOLOG -
                         MOM$LOAD 'current-search-string',SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]

                         If the current search string associated with MOM$LOAD in your
                         start-up file is SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] or if you have
                         already made this change for a previous installation, there
                         is no need to edit this file.

                         This command ensures that the location of the server image
                         is defined each time the system is rebooted, neccessary for
                         successful down-line loading.

                      2. Configure the server into  your  host's database.
                         Execute a command procedure  called  DSVCONFIG.COM. This
                         command  procedure is in the SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] directory.
                         If  you  have  already  executed  this  procedure from previous
                         installations, you need to configure only any additional units.
                         All previously defined units will still be configured.

                      3. The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for the DECserver 250
                         can be found in SYS$TEST and may be run at any time by executing
                         the command procedure DS25$IVP.COM.

                      The following example shows the beginning of the
                      configuration procedure. This example assumes
                      that the latest version of DSVCONFIG has already
                      been run so that the DSVCONFIG.DAT file exists
                      in the correct format. (See Chapter 3 for the
                      prompts that are displayed if the procedure has
                      to either create DSVCONFIG.DAT or reformat it.)

                         If you get an error message now, the new unit won't be added,
                         and you should delete it from the directory.

                      If you use the List option to get a listing
                      of servers, you see that BEETHO appears on the

                      In this example, replace an existing DECserver
                      100 unit named MOZART for a new DECserver 250
                      unit with the same DECnet node name. The new
                      DECserver 250 has printer support for both
                      parallel and serial printers. The DECnet node
                      address always stays the same with Swap. The new
                      server also has the same service circuit-ID as
                      the old server. (If you use Swap to change the
                      characteristics of the same server, you have to
                      specify the Ethernet address even though it will
                      not change.)

                      The following example, presented in five parts,
                      shows the installation verification for a VMS
                      load host. This procedure tests that your VMS
                      system can perform successfully as a down-line
                      load host for a particular server.

                      In this example, the VMS system is named SYSTEM.
                      The server that is loaded is a DECserver 250
                      unit with DECnet node name BEETHO. BEETHO is
                      an existing server currently operating on the
                      network. This example assumes that the down-line
                      load is performed during normal working hours.

              C.10 Example of Verification: Verifying the Server System
                   Installation

                      This example shows the verification of a server
                      system installation. This procedure tests the
                      hardware, the correctness of the software
                      version, and the ability of the new software
                      to run successfully.

                      It assumes that:

                      o  You are at a terminal connected to the server's
                         Port 1.

                      o  Your username is SWINSTALLER.

                      o  Your user password is SQUIDS.

                                                                    C-13

 





                      Examples: Installation, Configuration, Verification




                      o  You will test the server by connecting to your
                         own VMS system, SYSTEM. The new DECserver 250
                         software is Version 1.0.
