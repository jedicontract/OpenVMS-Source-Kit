          DESCRIPTION
 
          Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) enables users to electronically
          exchange structured business documents such as Purchase Orders,
          Dispatch Advice and Invoices with their Trading Partners using
          International,  National  and  Industry-specific  EDI  standards.
          DEC/EDI  offers  application  developers  all  the  facilities
          necessary  to  EDI-enable  Business  Applications  within  an
          Enterprise. Extensive communication options are also provided to
          facilitate inter-enterprise communication via EDI VANs or direct
          with Trading Partners using industry standard protocols.
 
          DEC/EDI uses a Client/Server architecture to provide EDI services
          to local and remote Business Applications hosted on multivendor
          platforms within an enterprise.
 
          A complete list of add-on services now available for DEC/EDI is
          under the section Software Requirements - Optional.
 
          DEC/EDI Application Client
 
          The DEC/EDI Application Client facilitates the integration of
          local and remote Business Applications to the DEC/EDI Server, to
          make them EDI-capable. A TCP/IP sockets based protocol is used to
          link the locally or remotely installed DEC/EDI Version 3.2 or
          Version 3.2B Application Clients to the DEC/EDI Server.
 
          DEC/EDI Version 3.2B Application Clients are available today for:
 
          o Compaq Tru64[TM] UNIX[R]
           
          o Compaq OpenVMS[TM] VAX and Alpha[TM]
           
          o HP-UX[R]
           
          o Sun[R] Solaris[R]
 
          These DEC/EDI Application Clients can interoperate with a DEC/EDI
          Server running on Compaq Tru64 UNIX, Compaq OpenVMS/VAX or Compaq
          OpenVMS/Alpha platforms.
 
                                                                August 2000

          Compaq DEC/EDI for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha, Version 3.2BSPD 53.14.05
 
 
 
          The interface provided by the DEC/EDI Application Client is file-
          based and allows for the Business Application to POST and FETCH
          files to and from Trading Partners via the DEC/EDI Server.
 
          The DEC/EDI Application Clients can be invoked via the Command
          Line Interface (CLI) and the Application Program Interface (API).
          The CLI can be run from a suitably coded script file (command
          file) or invoked interactively.
 
          The  DEC/EDI  Application  Client  also  provides  the  following
          functions:
 
          o Enables local and remote Business Applications to extract
            document status information via the TRACK Command, from the
            DEC/EDI Server.
           
          o Enable Business Applications to POST and FETCH files to and
            from other DEC/EDI Application Clients attached to the same
            DEC/EDI Server. The information exchanged between DEC/EDI
            Application Clients is mapped from the input format to the
            recipient format by using mapping tables based on an EDI
            Message definition.
           
          o POST and FETCH documents to and from the DEC/EDI Server and
            by-pass the Mapping or Mapping and Translation functions, for
            transmission and receipt to and from trading partners via the
            DEC/EDI Communication Component.
 
 
          DEC/EDI Server
 
          The DEC/EDI Server consists of the following components that
          reside on the same node:
 
          o DEC/EDI Mapper Component
           
          o DEC/EDI Translation Component
           
          o DEC/EDI Communications Component
           
          o DEC/EDI Operational Management Component
 
 
          Mapper Component
 
          This is a table-driven file mapping function with a set of data
          manipulation  operators  for  selected  classes  of  commonly
          encountered EDI application data.  This capability is used to
          convert data from the existing Business Application file format
          to that required for Translation into the Trading Partner format
          as well as formatting data received from the trading partner to
          the file format expected by the Business Application.

          The Mapping Process consists of:

 
          o Data Specification
 
          The  customer  defines  the  application  file  structure,  and
          parameters for mapping between the application file and the EDI
          standard  through  a  forms  or  PC  based  user  interface.  The
          interface then generates a conversion table that is used to map
          data from/to the application file formats.
 
          o User Defined Mapping
 
          The Mapper allows fields to be moved directly to the destination
          or to have built-in mathematical/logical/string operations to be
          performed upon the fields.  The user interface guides the user
          through this process.  The user can define and add code through
          "hooks" for more complex processing.
 
          o Data Definition Extracts
 
          The Mapper also allows for the extraction of Application file
          record definitions from Oracle@ CDD/Repository.
 
          The components of the Mapper Component are:
 
          o Mapper User Interface (UI)
 
          The UI consists of a set of menus and forms that allow users to
          create, modify, and compile mapping tables.
 
          o Mapper Run-time
 
          The Run-time process uses the information in a compiled mapping
          table to map data between the Business Application file and the
          format required for transmission and receipt to and from trading
          partners.
 
          Translation Component
 
          The Translation Component takes data that has come from the
          Business Application and transforms it into the standard EDI
          formats required for transmission to the Trading Partner.  It
          also takes incoming EDI data that has been received from a
          Trading Partner by the Communications Component, and converts it
          into the format that is suitable for the Mapper to decode and
          pass to the Application Client.
 
          The Translation Component provides the following features:
 
          o Support for multiple versions of messages (transactions) and
            EDI standards
           
          o Supports the transmission of 8-bit national character sets
           
          o Compliance checking at Trading Partner level

          o Supports the EDIFACT CONTRL and X12 997/999 messages to enable
            acknowledged receipt of messages.
 
          An editor is provided to enable users to customize the messages
          delivered with the product to create new messages for industry
          specific and Trading Partner specific messages as well as create
          new messages based on ANSI X12, EDIFACT, and TRADACOMS™ syntax
          rules supported by this version of the product.  The editor also
          allows  for  the  creation  of  new  versions  of  EDI  Standard
          dictionaries.
 
          Trading Partner agreement details, including the message formats
          being used, are recorded in the Trading Partner Profiles.  The
          Translation Component uses the information in the Trading Partner
          Profiles and the Message Database to perform compliance checking
          and to check the validity of the transaction.
 
          The Translation Component provides support for the following EDI
          standards:

          These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk.
          The sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the
          user's system environment, configuration, and software options.
 
          Additional disk space is required depending on the number of
          Mapping tables, performance needs, message size and software
          options.
 
          Memory Requirements
 
          The minimum memory supported is 64Mb.  However, the use of this
          software in conjunction with increased memory and multiple disks
          improves performance. The memory size suggested for most typical
          hardware configurations is at least 128Mb (especially when the
          X.25 and/or X.400 products are installed on the same processor).
