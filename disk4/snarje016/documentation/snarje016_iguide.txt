           In addition, the following OpenVMS classes are required
           for full functionality of Digital SNA Remote Job Entry for
           OpenVMS:

           o  OpenVMS Required Saveset

           o  Network Support

           o  Secure User's Environment

           The installation process consists of five major tasks. You
           must complete each installation task before you begin the
           next task.

           1. Ensure that you have adequate disk space before you
              begin to install RJE.

           2. Check to make sure that you have a complete distribu-
              tion kit. Each RJE distribution kit consists of one or
              more volume(s) of software and a set of documentation.

           3. Log in to the system manager's account, and execute the
              VMSINSTAL installation procedure.

           4. After you exit from the VMSINSTAL procedure, locate the
              RJE files on your system.

           5. Verify the successful installation of the RJE software.

        1.1 Running the VMSINSTAL Procedure

              The VMSINSTAL procedure allows you to install files onto
              your OpenVMS system from the distribution kit. VMSINSTAL
              is automated and requires little input from you beyond
              responding to prompts displayed on your screen. Most of
              the prompts require only a YES (Y) or NO (N) response.
              Default answers to prompts are displayed within brackets,
              as shown in the following example:

              [YES]:

              To select the default answer, press <RETURN>.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                You can install the RJE software from two locations:
                the Consolidated Software Distribution CD-ROM or
                a remote node in your local area network using the
                Remote Installation Service (RIS). The VMSINSTAL
                procedure presented in this chapter assumes the RJE
                software is being installed from your local area
                network.

                To install the RJE software from the Consolidated
                Software Distribution CD-ROM, see the master
                index table in the document Consolidated Software
                Distribution Disk User's Guide for the directory
                containing the RJE files.

                _____________________________________________________

        1.1.1 Logging In to the System Manager's Account

              To begin the VMSINSTAL procedure you must log in to the
              system manager's account and enter a command, as in the
              following example, to install the distribution kit on your
              OpenVMS host:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SNARJE dduu:

              where

              o  dduu: identifies the device on which the distribution
                 kit is mounted.

              o  SNARJE is the name of the distribution kit for the
                 Digital SNA RJE software.

                                                        Installation 1-3

 






           The VMSINSTAL sample shown in this manual describes a
           simple installation. Your installation might include
           additional prompts, depending on your configuration and
           whether you have other products already installed. For a
           full description of the VMSINSTAL procedure, refer to the
           OpenVMS System Manager's Manual.

           After you log in to the system manager's account and
           load the volume(s) from your distribution kit, VMSINSTAL
           displays the following text:

              OpenVMS VAX Software Product Installation Procedure Vn

              It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

           Note that the previous example shows that the software
           has been loaded on an OpenVMS VAX system. Next, VMSINSTAL
           shows you the status of your current active processes and
           asks you if you want to continue with the installation.

              %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
                 SMISERVER
               BATCH_601
               SERVER_002C
               _RTA3:
              * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

           If you continue with the installation procedure, the
           active processes might be affected, depending upon the
           utilities these processes are using. If you answer with
           the default NO, VMSINSTAL terminates. A YES answer causes
           VMSINSTAL to continue.

     1.1.2 Making a Backup Copy of the System Disk

           The VMSINSTAL procedure then prompts you as follows:

              * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

           Make sure that you have a backup copy of your system
           disk before you proceed with an installation that writes
           to your system disk. Having a backup copy is important
           because your disk could be corrupted during installation.

     1-4 Installation

 






              If you do not have a backup copy of your system disk,
              enter N, and VMSINSTAL stops to allow you to create
              one. For instructions on how to back up a system disk,
              see the OpenVMS Backup Utility Manual. After you have
              created a backup copy, start the VMSINSTAL procedure
              again. If you already have a backup copy of your system
              disk, press <RETURN> to continue the installation without
              interruption.

        1.1.3 Mounting the Distribution Kit Volume

              Next, VMSINSTAL tells you to mount the distribution kit
              volume on the device you specified when you began the
              procedure. It then asks if you are ready to continue with
              the installation, as follows:

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on dduu
                 * Are you ready?

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                VMSINSTAL is a universal installation procedure, and
                you can use it to install products with more than
                one volume in the distribution kit. When you are
                installing a product that contains only one volume
                in the kit, like RJE, the procedure still asks you
                to mount "the first volume" but does not prompt you
                to mount any additional volumes.

                _____________________________________________________

              After you have mounted the distribution kit volume, answer
              YES to the question * Are you ready?. VMSINSTAL responds
              with a message verifying that you mounted the volume
              correctly and the installation is continuing, as follows:

               %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, SNARJE mounted on dduu:
                 The following products will be processed:

                   SNARJE V1.5

                    Beginning installation of SNARJE V1.5 at hh:mm

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A ...
                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED , The product's release notes have been
                 successfully moved to SYS$HELP.

                                                        Installation 1-5

 






     1.1.4 Confirming Your License

           During the installation of the RJE software, the VMSINSTAL
           procedure asks you to confirm that you registered your
           Product Authorization Key (PAK) and are licensed to run
           RJE.

                      Product:      SNA-RJE
                      Producer:     DEC
                      Version:      Vx.x
                      Release Date: dd-mmm-yyyy

             * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

           If you answer YES, VMSINSTAL continues with the installa-
           tion.

           If you answer NO, VMSINSTAL displays the following
           message:

                 Digital SNA Remote Job Entry requires you to register your
                      Product Authorization Key (PAK). You should have received
                      the PAK with your kit.

                      Register your PAK with...

                   $ @sys$update:vmslicense

                      after the installation completes. The product will not
                      function until this is done.

           As the example indicates, if you have not registered your
           PAK, the installation will complete successfully, but you
           will not be able to run RJE. You can use the product only
           after registering your PAK.

     1.1.5 Purging the Distribution Files

           This installation creates new distribution files on your
           system. The VMSINSTAL procedure next asks if you want to
           delete the existing versions (if any) of these files that
           are superseded by the new files.

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

           If this is your first RJE software installation, you
           will have no files to purge. Type NO and press <RETURN>.
           To delete the old files, answer with the default YES;
           VMSINSTAL automatically deletes the old files.

     1-6 Installation

 






              At this point, VMSINSTAL describes the Installation
              Verification Procedure (IVP). The system message appears
              as follows:

                       You can verify the SNA-RJE installation using the IVP. This
                       is recommended, and will help ensure that the installation has
                       completed correctly by:

                       o  Removing or renaming the V1.4 files, only if they exist.
                       o  Stopping the V1.4 processes, only if they exist.
                       o  Verifying the existence of the V1.5 files.
                       o  Initializing the V1.5 processes.
                       o  Verifying inter-process communication.

                       Once the installation is complete, you can execute the IVP
                       by using the command:

                           $ @sys$test:snarje$ivp.com

                       NOTE:  Do NOT execute the IVP unless you have a PAK registered
                              for SNA-RJE V1.5. The IVP will not complete successfully
                              due to the RJE components failing their license check.

              Then the installation completes, and the following
              messages appear:

                       All installation questions have been asked. No more
                       input from the terminal will be required.

                       Your Digital SNA RJE V1.5 installation is nearing completion.
                       Remember to use..

                           $ @sys$startup:snarje$startup

                       to start the detached processes.

               %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories...

                Installation of SNARJE V1.5 completed at hh:mm

              The procedure then prompts you for the next product you
              wish to install. If you have another product to install,
              enter the product name and respond to the prompts as they
              appear. Consult the installation manual for that product
              for further information. If you have no further products
              to install, press <RETURN>, and VMSINSTAL terminates with
              a confirmation message as follows:

                                                        Installation 1-7

 






             Enter the products to be processed from the next distribution volume set.
             * Products: <RETURN>
            VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm


     1.2 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

           To run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP),
           enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

              @SYS$TEST:SNARJE$IVP.COM

           The following message appears:

                     Starting RJE Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

                This procedure will first check for the existence of V1.4 processes
                and files. This will take a moment.

           If the IVP finds files from Version 1.4 of RJE in your
           system directories, the procedure informs you that it
           has found these files. It then asks if you want to delete
           them.

            You currently have Digital SNA Remote Job Entry for OpenVMS V1.4 files
            in your system directories. The naming convention for V1.5 has been
            updated, and the older files should either be DELETED, or RENAMED.

            * Delete the outdated files [Y/N]:

           To delete the outdated files, answer YES. VMSINSTAL
           deletes the files and sends you confirming messages, as in
           the following example:

            The following outdated files are being DELETED.
            %DELETE-I-FILDEL, SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]SNAREADER.EXE;7 deleted (60 blocks)

           To keep the outdated files, answer NO. The outdated files
           will appear in the system directories with the designation
           "_V14" appended to the file name.

           Next, VMSINSTAL begins to initialize the RJE Version 1.4
           processes, as in the following example:

                    Now the V1.5 processes will be initialized, using

                        @sys$startup:snarje$startup.com

            Creating detached process - SNARJE$MPX
            %RUN-S-PROC_ID, identification of created process is 24600957

               Creating detached process - SNARJE$SERVER
               %RUN-S-PROC_ID, identification of created process is 24600958

                       The process initialization may take a few moments. The IVP
                       will wait until both processes are fully declared, and will
                       then proceed.

              When initialization of the Version 1.5 process is
              complete, the IVP creates a workstation and automatically
              executes a series of RJE commands to verify that RJE is
              correctly installed. The following is an example of normal
              IVP output:

                       A workstation will now be created and some very basic
                       tests will be performed. This workstation will make use
                       of the OpenVMS based RJE Server.

        1.3 Locating Files After Installation

              After you run the VMSINSTAL procedure, you can find the
              RJE files in the following locations on your system:

              When you install RJE, VMSINSTAL automatically creates an
              RJE server, SNARJE$SERVER.EXE., on your OpenVMS system. If
              your Gateway resources are limited because your Gateway is
              supporting multiple tasks or does not have an RJE server,
              you can try to increase throughput by running RJE through
              the RJE server on your OpenVMS system.

     1.4 Verifying Installation of the RJE Software

           After you have installed the Digital SNA RJE for OpenVMS
           software, you should verify that it can communicate with
           the appropriate IBM application subsystem. You should
           be able to verify communication provided the following
           conditions exist:

           o  All other components in your configuration are properly
              installed.

           o  You have a link from your system to the IBM host.

           This section provides sample procedures for accessing an
           IBM Job Entry Subsystem by using two commonly available
           IBM utilities: JES2 and JES3. If you need more information
           about any command variables used in the following samples,
           see Digital SNA Remote Job Entry for OpenVMS Use. To
           verify that you have successfully installed the Digital
           SNA RJE for OpenVMS software, complete the following
           steps:

           1. Run the SNARJE$STARTUP.COM file.

           2. Verify that the RJE software is installed on your
              system and that all other necessary components are
              installed and running.

           3. Set up your terminal by entering the following OpenVMS
              command:

              $ SET TERMINAL/BROADCAST

           4. Enter the following commands to invoke RJE and to
              identify the workstation:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SNARJE
              SNARJE> USE workstation-name

              where workstation-name is a one- to eight-character
              name you assign to the workstation you are creating.

              5. Configure or set up the workstation using the following
                 sequence of commands:

                 SNARJE> SET WORKSTATION/GATEWAY=gateway-node-name
                 SNARJE> SET WORKSTATION/ACCESS=access-name/DATA=logon-data
                 SNARJE> SET MONITOR

              6. Assign the default queue SNARJE$READER to the reader
                 stream:

                 SNARJE> ASSIGN SNARJE$READER RD1

              7. Configure a print stream:

                 SNARJE> ASSIGN disk:[directory] PR1

              8. Set the workstation ON:

                 SNARJE> SET WORKSTATION/STATE=ON

                 Setting the workstation ON enables messages from the
                 IBM host to be displayed on your screen.

              9. Enter interactive console mode:

                 SNARJE> SET CONSOLE

             10. Type IBM RJE console commands to send data to your
                 terminal. For example, for JES2 type the following
                 command:

                 $ DU,JES workstation

                 where JES workstation is a valid JES workstation
                 designation.

                 For JES3, type the following command:

                 I,Q,N=ALL

                 These commands cause JES2 or JES3 to display data on
                 your screen.

             11. Press <CTRL/Z> to return to SNARJE. Then type EXIT to
                 return to DCL.

              At this point your RJE software is installed correctly.
