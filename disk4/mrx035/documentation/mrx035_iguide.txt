                                                                 Preface



              Purpose of this Guide

              This guide explains how to install the VAX[TM] Message
              Router[TM] X.400 Gateway (MRX) Version 3.5 on network
              nodes or clusters that run under the OpenVMS[TM] operating
              system. You should read the whole of this guide before
              installing the product.

              After installing MRX, but before configuring it, you need
              to know the structure of the X.400 networks that you are
              joining. VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway Management Guide
              gives some examples of X.400 network configurations.
              You should not attempt the MRX configuration tasks
              described in Chapter 3 of this guide without reading the
              configuration and planning sections of the VAX Message
              Router X.400 Gateway Management Guide first.

                                               Preparing to Install MRX



              This chapter explains how to prepare the system before
              installing the Message Router X.400 Gateway (MRX). It
              starts with an outline of the main tasks involved in the
              installation process.

        1.1 The Tasks Involved

              Before installing the MRX software, you need to carry out
              the following preparatory tasks:

              o  Read this manual throughout

              o  Check that the distribution kit is complete and
                 correct, as described in Section 1.2

              o  Check that your system has the required hardware and
                 software resources, as described in Section 1.3

              o  Prepare the system to receive the new software, as
                 described in Section 1.4

              When these tasks are complete, install MRX as described in
              Chapter 2. You do this using VMSINSTAL, an OpenVMS utility
              for installing optional software products in an OpenVMS
              environment. When the installation is complete, carry out
              the post-installation tasks described in Chapter 3.

              You need to install MRX on at least one Message Router
              node in every Message Router network that requires MRX
              services. You can install MRX on more than one Message
              Router node in a network but not on more than one node
              in a VAXcluster[TM], if this is required for improving
              throughput. In this case, the installation procedure is
              the same for each node in turn.

                                           Preparing to Install MRX  1-1

 






           If you are upgrading from an earlier version of MRX, then
           the procedure is much the same as when installing MRX
           for the first time. You can directly upgrade from V2.3 to
           V3.5. If you are running versions earlier than V2.3 you
           need to first upgrade to V2.3 and then to V3.5.

     1.2 Checking the Distribution Kit

           Make sure you have a complete kit, by checking the
           contents of the kit against the bill of materials. All
           kits should contain:

           o  A magnetic tape or a TK50 cartridge, containing the two
              save sets that contain the files listed in Section A.1

           o  A Software Product Description (SPD)

           o  The following MRX guides:

              -  VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway Installation Guide
                 - Version 3.5

              -  VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway Management Guide -
                 Version 2.3

              -  VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway Problem Solving
                 Guide- Version 2.3

              -  VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway User's Guide -
                 Version 2.3

           Each kit should also contain the manuals for any other
           software products that are shipped with MRX.

           One of the supplied files contains the MRX Release Notes.
           This is a short introductory document describing the
           features that are new to the current version of MRX. It
           also contains last-minute information about MRX, some
           of which may be relevant to the installation procedure.
           Therefore when you come to run VMSINSTAL, print the
           Release Notes as described in Chapter 2, and read them
           before installing MRX; alternatively you can view them
           on-screen.


     1-2 Preparing to Install MRX

 






        1.3 Checking Hardware and Software Resources

              To install MRX you need a valid VAX or MicroVAX[TM]
              hardware configuration. This must have sufficient disk
              space to install MRX and the prerequisite software
              products. For MRX itself you need to ensure the following
              space is available:

              o  At least 25000 blocks temporarily free on the disk that
                 holds the SYS$UPDATE directory. VMSINSTAL uses this
                 space to store the product saveset for the duration of
                 the installation.

                 If you used the OpenVMS Tailoring Utility to remove any
                 software libraries after you installed OpenVMS on your
                 system, you must make sure that the following OpenVMS
                 classes are present for MRX to perform correctly:

                 o  OpenVMS required saveset

                 o  Programming support

                 o  Secure user's environment

                 o  Network support

                 o  Utilities

                 o  OpenVMS DECwindows

                 For more information on OpenVMS classes and tailoring,
                 see the OpenVMS Version 5.5 Upgrade and Installation
                 Manual.

                 After replacing these libraries, make sure that you
                 still have 25000 blocks temporarily free on the disk.

              o  4800 blocks on the system disk. This is for MRX's
                 permanent use to hold the MRX images and data files.

              o  At least 200 free blocks on the disk that holds the
                 MAILbus files. This is to hold the MRX$ directory.

                 This space is sufficient for the initial MRX$
                 directory, but you may need extra space for growth.
                 As a guide, allow three blocks for each subscriber you
                 intend to add.

                                           Preparing to Install MRX  1-3

 






              The installation procedure creates the MRX$ directory
              as a sub-directory of the MB$ directory. This means
              that you might need to increase the quota of the
              MBMANAGER account.

           You also need the following prerequisite software
           installed on your system (with at least the given version
           numbers) before you install MRX:

           MRX V3.5 requires:

           o  OpenVMS[TM] for VAX[TM] Version 6.2.

           o  For OpenVMS[TM]/VAX Version 6.2 the DECnet/OSI
              [R]required is Version 6.3

           o  Message Router Version 3.5

              Not only must Message Router be installed, but it must
              also be configured before you can install MRX. Refer to
              the VAX Message Router Configuration Guide.

           o  The ODA CDA Gateway Version 1.0, if you want MRX to
              handle ODIF documents.

           You must also check that the Product Authorization Key
           (PAK) for MRX (MESSAGE-ROUTER-X.400) is registered and
           active by typing the following command:

           $ LICENSE LIST /FULL MESSAGE-ROUTER-X.400

           Details of the MESSAGE-ROUTER-X.400 license are displayed.
           Check that the license is active and if it is not, you
           must load and register the PAK for MRX as described in the
           VMS License Management Utility Manual.

     1.4 Preparing the System

           Before starting the installation, you must prepare the
           system to receive the new software as follows:

           1. Log in to the SYSTEM account. If you want a record of
              the installation procedure, then use the command SET
              HOST with the /LOG qualifier: for example:

              $ SET HOST 0 /LOG=SYS$LOGIN:MRX_INSTALL.LOG

           2. Use the OpenVMS Backup Utility to make a copy of the
              system disk and the disk on which you are installing
              MRX (if other than the system disk).

     1-4 Preparing to Install MRX

 






                 If a system failure occurs at a critical point during
                 installation, the disks could be corrupted. Preparing a
                 backup copy enables you to recover the disks. Also,
                 you are given the opportunity to purge old files
                 during installation; the backup copy enables you to
                 recover any files purged in error. Backup and recovery
                 procedures are described in VMS Backup Utility Manual.

              3. Make sure that you have the necessary prerequisite
                 software installed and configured on your system.
                 If any of the components of your MAILbus system are
                 running, stop them by using the MAILbus command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:MB$CONTROL STOP=(ER,...,DDS,TS,MS)

                 where ... is replaced by other gateways such as MRG,
                 MRP and MRS. If this is not a new installation, include
                 MRX in this command.

              4. Use the DCL command SHOW DEVICE to make sure that
                 you have the necessary disk space, as listed in
                 Section 1.3; for example:

                 $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

                 Device        Device  Error   Volume        Free    Trans   Mnt
                 Name          Status  Count   Label         Blocks  Count   Cnt

                 $1$DOA0       Mounted   0     VAXVMSRL055   36895    210     4

              5. If you used the OpenVMS Tailoring Utility to remove any
                 software libraries after you installed OpenVMS on your
                 system, you must make sure that the following OpenVMS
                 classes are present for MRX to perform correctly:

                 -  OpenVMS required saveset

                 -  Programming support

                 -  Secure user's environment

                 -  Network support

                 -  Utilities

                 -  OpenVMS DECwindows

                 For more information on OpenVMS classes and tailoring,
                 see the OpenVMS Version 5.5 Upgrade and Installation
                 Manual.

           6. You must ensure that the SYSTEM account is set up with
              sufficient quota. The quotas that you set to install
              and run Message Router are sufficient to install and
              run MRX.


     1.5 Installing MRX on a VAXcluster

           If you install MRX on a VAXcluster, you must ensure
           that the VAXcluster complies with all the requirements
           for installing Message Router on a VAXcluster. These
           requirements are described in the VAX Message Router
           Installation Guide.

           In a VAXcluster, all the nodes may share a single
           SYSUAF.DAT file and DECnet database or one group of nodes
           may share one set of resources, and another group may
           share a different set of resources. Also, in a cluster,
           there may be a single system disk or multiple system
           disks.

           Irrespective of how your cluster is defined, there must be
           only one MRX environment within the cluster. However, MRX
           does not need to be installed and configured on all nodes
           in a cluster.

           Choose the set of nodes that you want MRX to run on,
           and make sure you install it such that the installation
           satisfies the following two constraints:

           o  It modifies all the SYSUAF.DAT files and DECnet
              databases that are shared by those nodes

           o  It modifies all the system disks that are used by those
              nodes

           To satisfy both of these constraints, you may need to
           perform more than one installation. However, all the
           installations of MRX on a cluster must use the same MRX
           environment, that is, the same MRX$ directory structure
           and associated data files.

           If you have configured Message Router to use a cluster
           alias, you must set the /CLUSTER_ALIAS MRX control
           parameter. See the VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway
           Management Guide for information about the MRX parameters.

     1-6 Preparing to Install MRX

 






              Digital recommends that only one MRX in a cluster should
              be connected to the OSI tower. If you install more than
              one MRX in a cluster, the rest should operate as slave
              translators, that is, they should not be connected to the
              OSI tower on their node.

              For more information about managing MRX in a VAXcluster,
              refer to the VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway Management
              Guide.

                                                          Installing MRX



              This chapter explains the procedure for installing the
              MRX software. Before you start, make sure that you have
              prepared the system as described in Section 1.4. Then work
              through the sections in this chapter:

              o  Section 2.1 explains the overall method of using the
                 VMSINSTAL procedure to install MRX.

              o  Section 2.2 explains the type of errors that can arise
                 in the course of running VMSINSTAL.

              o  Section 2.3 gives a step-by-step account of the
                 VMSINSTAL procedure, explaining how to call the
                 procedure, what happens at each step, and the responses
                 you are required to make.

              With the exception of the VMSINSTAL command (shown below)
              to install MRX V3.5, the installation procedure is the
              same as for MRX V2.3.

              The command to install MRX V3.5 is:

              @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL MRX035 device OPTIONS N

              where device is the name of the device where the
              distribution medium is to be mounted.

        2.1 How to Use VMSINSTAL

              The MRX software consists of two save sets. You install
              the software from the save sets on to the system by using
              VMSINSTAL; this is an OpenVMS procedure for installing
              optional software products in an OpenVMS environment. The
              main steps are as follows:

              o  Log in to the SYSTEM account, and execute VMSINSTAL.

                                                      Installing MRX 2-1

 






           o  The VMSINSTAL procedure takes the form of a dialogue
              in which you are asked a sequence of questions about
              the way MRX is to be installed. In response to each
              question you type the appropriate details and press
              RETURN.

              The VMSINSTAL procedure is self-explanatory, but
              Appendix B contains a sample log of the VMSINSTAL
              procedure for the purposes of reference.

           o  Some questions offer a default answer, enclosed in
              square brackets []. You can accept this default by
              pressing RETURN without typing anything.

           o  At any step you can get on-line help by typing a
              question mark (?) and pressing RETURN.

           o  You can abort the VMSINSTAL procedure at any time
              by pressing CTRL/Y. If, subsequently, you want to
              run VMSINSTAL again, you must start again from the
              beginning.

           o  The whole procedure should take about 20 minutes on a
              MICROVAX II. The installation verification procedure
              (IVP) runs automatically if you request it. The IVP
              checks that the MRX components are correctly installed.
              If you do not want to run the IVP automatically when
              MRX is installed, you can run it separately at a later
              date by entering the following command:

              $ @MB$CVPDIR:MB$MRXIVP

           VMSINSTAL distinguishes among the following kinds of
           installation, and installs the MRX files accordingly:

           o  First-time installation - that is, MRX has never been
              installed before

           o  Upgrade installation - an earlier version of MRX is
              already installed, and you are now installing Version
              3.5

           o  Reinstallation - MRX Version 3.5 has been installed
              before, and is now being reinstalled, perhaps because
              of an earlier error

     2-2 Installing MRX

 






              The list of MRX files in Table A-2 of the VAX Message
              Router X.400 Gateway Installation Guide should not include
              the MRX$MTA_CONVERT.EXE file. This file is no longer
              included in MRX.

              The MRX CVP and IVP both check that all the MRX files are
              present. The total number of files now included in MRX is
              30.

        2.2 Error Handling

              During the installation procedure, VMSINSTAL displays a
              number of cautionary messages and general information
              messages. Read all messages carefully and follow the
              advice they offer. If you are not sure how to answer a
              question, ask for explanatory text by typing a question
              mark (?) and pressing RETURN.

              If you get an error message during installation, check
              that you have responded to the prompts correctly; you may
              have made a typing error or given an incorrect response.
              Also check that you have prepared the system properly
              beforehand, and that the required resources are all
              available.

              If your responses are correct, but the error recurs, then
              restart the installation. If the installation fails again
              at the same point, you should contact:

              o  Your Customer Support Center, if you have a service
                 contract with Digital

              o  Your local Digital office, if you do not have a service
                 contract and want to arrange one

        2.3 Installation Procedure

              From the SYSTEM account on the node where you want to
              install MRX, enter:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL MRX035 device OPTIONS N

              where device denotes the name of the device where you will
              mount the supplied software: for example, MTA0. If you
              omit the device name, VMSINSTAL will prompt you for it
              during the dialogue.

                                                      Installing MRX 2-3

 






           The OPTIONS N parameter enables you to print the Release
           Notes or view them on-screen, when the file is unbundled
           in the course of the procedure. If you have already read
           the Release Notes then omit this parameter.

           The installation procedure starts.

                                                   After Installing MRX



              After the installation is complete you should perform the
              following tasks:

              o  Configure MRX as described in the VAX Message Router
                 X.400 Gateway Management Guide. If you do not want to
                 configure MRX immediately, start the rest of MAILbus by
                 entering the following command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:MB$CONTROL START=(MS,TS,DDS,...,ER)

                 Include the identifiers of any gateways installed other
                 than MRX.

              o  If you operate on a cluster, identify the nodes on
                 which you want MRXMAN to run, in addition to the node
                 where the main MRX software is installed. (MRXMAN is
                 the MRX management utility.)

                                                MRX Files and Privileges



              This appendix lists the files that are supplied on the
              MRX distribution media and the files that remain on your
              system after installation. It also describes the MRX
              images that are installed with privileges.

        A.1 MRX Files

              This section has two tables of MRX files:

              o  Table A-1 lists the files that make up MRX, as supplied
                 on the MRX distribution media. The files are in two
                 save sets: A and B.

              o  Table A-2 lists the files that are present on your
                 system after installing MRX.

                 The file protection codes apply respectively to System,
                 Owner, Group, and World levels, and are the recommended
                 settings applied in the distributed software.

     %MRX-I-CHKOSAK, Checking for OSAK Version 3.0

     VMSINSTAL is about to check for running MRX or MRXMAN processes.

     If any MRX processes are running, the installation will abort. If any
     MRXMAN processes are running, they will not abort the installation,
     although you are advised to stop these processes before continuing.
