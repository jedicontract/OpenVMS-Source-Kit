              1       Preinstallation Considerations



                      This chapter includes important installation
                      considerations that you must be aware of before
                      you install DEC DATATRIEVE Version 6.1. Read this
                      chapter carefully before you proceed to Chapter
                      2.

                      To prepare your system for installing DEC
                      DATATRIEVE, you must perform the following tasks:

                      o  Verify that your system has enough memory and
                         available disk space to install and use DEC
                         DATATRIEVE.

                      o  Register the Product Authorization Key (PAK)
                         that is shipped with this version of DEC
                         DATATRIEVE.

                      o  Verify that your system has the correct
                         versions of the optional and required software
                         you will be using with DEC DATATRIEVE.

                      o  Check your system and the installing account
                         to ensure that parameters and quotas are
                         sufficient for installing and using DEC
                         DATATRIEVE.

                      This chapter tells you what actions to take
                      to prepare your system for installing DEC
                      DATATRIEVE.

              __________________________________________________________
              1.1 Prerequisite Hardware

                      Installing DEC DATATRIEVE requires a certain
                      amount of free disk storage space during the
                      installation. Once DEC DATATRIEVE is installed,
                      less storage space is required.

                                                                     1-1

              1.2 OpenVMS Licensing Management Facility (LMF)

                      This version of DEC DATATRIEVE supports the
                      License Management Facility provided by
                      OpenVMS. See the OpenVMS documentation for more
                      information.

                      You should register the information contained
                      in the Product Authorization Key (PAK) that is
                      shipped with DEC DATATRIEVE before you begin
                      the installation. You can register by using the
                      License command procedure using the following
                      command:

                      $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE

                      1-2

 





                      Preinstallation Considerations




                      You can also use the LICENSE REGISTER command
                      to register the information contained in the
                      PAK. Both methods are described in the OpenVMS
                      documentation.

                      DEC DATATRIEVE asks you early in the installation
                      procedure whether or not you have registered and
                      loaded an authorization key. You can install
                      this version of DEC DATATRIEVE without the
                      authorization key information, but you cannot run
                      DEC DATATRIEVE or the Installation Verification
                      Procedure (IVP).

              __________________________________________________________
              1.3 Prerequisite Software

                      You must have the correct versions of the
                      optional and required software products you
                      will be using with DEC DATATRIEVE. Install those
                      products in the order specified in Section 1.3.3.

              _____________________________
              1.3.1 Required Software Products

                      This version of DEC DATATRIEVE is a complete
                      kit. You do not need any previous versions of DEC
                      DATATRIEVE to install it.

                      On OpenVMS VAX operating systems, DEC DATATRIEVE
                      Version 6.1 requires Version 5.5-2 or higher
                      of the operating system. If you have a version
                      lower than 5.5-2, you must install the OpenVMS
                      VAX Version 5.5-2 operating system before you can
                      install DEC DATATRIEVE. To check which version
                      of the operating system is currently installed on
                      your system, use the SHOW SYSTEM command at the
                      DCL prompt.

                      On OpenVMS AXP operating systems, DEC DATATRIEVE
                      Version 6.1 requires Version 1.5 of the operating
                      system.

                      On OpenVMS VAX operating systems, you must have
                      Version 5.0 or higher of CDD/Repository before
                      you can install DEC DATATRIEVE.

                                                                     1-3

 





                      Preinstallation Considerations




                      On OpenVMS AXP operating systems, you must have
                      Version 5.3 or higher of CDD/Repository before
                      you can install DEC DATATRIEVE.

                      To check which version of CDD/Repository is
                      currently installed on the system, use the
                      following command:

                      $ DICTIONARY OPERATOR

                      The CDO banner gives the version of
                      CDD/Repository currently installed on your
                      system. For example:

                      o  CDA converter library

                      o  DECwindows Motif

                      Note: if any Asian version of FMS, DECforms or
                      Rdb is present on the system, then DEC DATATRIEVE
                      will be linked with the Asian version instead of
                      the English version.

                      Preinstallation Considerations




                      On OpenVMS AXP operating systems VAX Rdb/ELN, VAX
                      TDMS, and VIDA are not available.

                      Refer to the DEC DATATRIEVE Before You Install
                      Letter to determine which versions of these
                      optional software products are compatible with
                      DEC DATATRIEVE Version 6.1.

                      If an optional product is on the system but is
                      not the version required by DEC DATATRIEVE, the
                      installation procedure will not install the User
                      Environment Test Package (UETP) for that product.
                      (Note that not all optional software products
                      have a UETP.)

                      If you want to ready domains that reside on a
                      remote node of a PDP-11 system, you must have
                      Version 3.2 or higher of the DEC DATATRIEVE
                      software installed on the remote node that you
                      want to access.

              _____________________________
              1.3.3 Order of Product Installation

                      When you install required and optional software
                      products with DEC DATATRIEVE, you should install
                      these products in the following order:

                      o  Optional LSE

                         If you plan to use LSE with DEC DATATRIEVE,
                         you should install LSE before installing
                         other required or optional software products.
                         However, if you choose to install LSE at a
                         later date, the DEC DATATRIEVE installation
                         procedure provides you with the option
                         of performing a modified DEC DATATRIEVE
                         installation to provide DEC DATATRIEVE support
                         for LSE at that time.

                      o  Optional DEC Rdb

                         If you plan to use DEC Rdb with DEC DATATRIEVE,
                         you should follow the order-of-installation
                         instructions provided with CDD/Repository to
                         insure the proper operation of CDD/Repository
                         with DEC Rdb.

                                                                     1-5

 





                      Preinstallation Considerations




                      o  CDD/Repository

                      o  Optional forms products (VAX TDMS, FMS,
                         DECforms)

                      o  Optional database products (DEC DBMS,
                         VAX Rdb/ELN,VIDA)

                         Install DEC DBMS, VAX Rdb/ELN, and VIDA before
                         installing DEC DATATRIEVE to make sure the
                         installation includes sample databases and User
                         Environment Test Packages. You do not have to
                         install these optional database products before
                         DEC DATATRIEVE to use the products with DEC
                         DATATRIEVE.

                      o  Optional CDA converter library

                      o  Optional DECwindows Motif

                      o  DEC DATATRIEVE

                                             Note

                         DECforms, the CDA converter library, and
                         DECwindows Motif can also be installed after
                         DEC DATATRIEVE.

              __________________________________________________________
              1.4 VAXcluster Consideration (VAX Only)

                      This installation procedure lets you install
                      DEC DATATRIEVE only on a system-rooted device.
                      Whether you are installing DEC DATATRIEVE on a
                      VAXcluster or in a nonclustered environment, the
                      installation procedure places the files that it
                      generates in SYS$COMMON, not in SYS$SPECIFIC. The
                      installation defines the logical name DTR$LIBRARY
                      as SYS$COMMON:[DTR].

              __________________________________________________________
              1.5 VMScluster Consideration

                      If you are using a dual-architecture (VAX and AXP
                      systems) heterogeneous cluster, before executing
                      these commands, make sure the appropriate logical
                      names have been set to define the scope of the
                      SYSMAN DO commands. For more information, see
                      OpenVMS System Manager's Manual.

              1.6 Preparing Your System and the Installing Account

                      This section tells you which characteristics
                      of your system and installing account need to
                      be checked before you install DEC DATATRIEVE.
                      These characteristics include process quotas,
                      access control privileges to CDD$TOP, and system
                      parameters. Instructions are given for checking
                      and modifying the relevant characteristics of
                      your system and installing account.

              _____________________________
              1.6.1 Required Parameters

                      You must check that the value of your process
                      quotas and system parameters are sufficient for
                      installing DEC DATATRIEVE. You can check these
                      values in the CDD/Repository documentation.

              _____________________________
              1.6.1.1 Global Pages (or pagelets) and Global Sections
                      (GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS Parameters)

                      If you plan to install various DEC DATATRIEVE
                      images as SHARED, you need sufficient global
                      pages (on OpenVMS VAX systems) or pagelets
                      (on OpenVMS AXP systems), and global sections.
                      The installation procedure asks you about four
                      images: DDMFxx, DTR32xx, DTRSHRxx, and DTRMSGS.
                      (The xx at the end of the file name refers to
                      the optional suffix that you can specify in the
                      installation procedure. See Section 2.5.4 for
                      more information.) You do not have to install all
                      of these images; you need sufficient global pages
                      and global sections only for those you do wish to
                      install.

                      DEC DATATRIEVE automatically installs the DTRHELP
                      image as SHARED. You need sufficient global pages
                      and global sections for this image.

                      The following table indicates the requirements
                      for the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS parameters for
                      the image files that are part of this version of
                      DEC DATATRIEVE on OpenVMS VAX operating systems.

              1.6.2 CDD/Repository Considerations

                      Before you install DEC DATATRIEVE, you should
                      perform the following tasks:

                      o  Check the contents of the dictionary directory
                         CDD$TOP.DTR$LIB for user definitions and
                         subdirecto- ries. Back these up if they exist.

                      1-8

 





                      Preinstallation Considerations




                      o  Make sure the installation account has all
                         access privileges to CDD$TOP.

                      The next two sections explain these procedures.

              _____________________________
              1.6.2.1 Effect of Installation Procedure on Existing
                      DTR$LIB Directory

                      The directory CDD$TOP.DTR$LIB is reserved for use
                      by Digital. The installation procedure builds,
                      or rebuilds, this directory each time you install
                      DEC DATATRIEVE. The directory should contain
                      only directories that contain definitions for
                      the plots and sample domains, records, and tables
                      that are shipped with the product. Users should
                      not create any dictionary objects or directories
                      that have DTR$LIB as part of their path names.

                      When the installation procedure rebuilds
                      DTR$LIB, it deletes the existing DTR$LIB
                      hierarchy. Therefore, you should check that
                      DEC DATATRIEVE users have not placed their own
                      definitions either in DTR$LIB or in any part
                      of its substructure. Extract user definitions
                      you want to save and redefine them in another
                      directory.

              _____________________________
              1.6.2.2 Required Privileges to CDD$TOP

                      Because the installation procedure builds or
                      rebuilds DTR$LIB, the installation account must
                      have all access control privileges to CDD$TOP.
                      You can check these privileges with the following
                      command sequence:

                      $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:DMU
                      DMU> SHOW PROTECTION CDD$TOP

                      The resulting privileges list should include the
                      following:

                      CONTROL          GLOBAL_DELETE

                                                                     1-9

 





                      Preinstallation Considerations





                      DTR_EXTEND       HISTORY

                      DTR_MODIFY       LOCAL_DELETE

                      DTR_READ         PASS_THRU

                      DTR_WRITE        SEE

                      EXTEND           UPDATE

                      FORWARD

                      After checking the privileges list, type EXIT
                      and press the RETURN key to return to DCL command
                      level.

                      If any of the required privileges are not
                      available or if they are denied or banished, you
                      must change the access control list (ACL) entry
                      to provide all privileges for the duration of the
                      installation. One way you can do this is to enter
                      the following sequence of commands:

                      $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:DMU
                      DMU> SET PROTECTION/GRANT=ALL/UIC=[1,4]-
                      DMU> /POSITION=1 CDD$TOP
                      DMU> EXIT

                      If you are using an account other than [1,4] for
                      the installation, replace [1,4] with the UIC of
                      that account.

                      After the installation procedure is complete,
                      you can remove the ACL entry with the following
                      command sequence:

                      $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:DMU
                      DMU> DELETE/PROTECTION/POSITION=1 CDD$TOP
                      DMU> EXIT

                      For your convenience during future installations
                      of DEC DATATRIEVE, you might want to create
                      command files containing these two sequences
                      of commands.

              _____________________________
              1.6.3 Effect of Installation Procedure on the Logical
                    DTR$LIBRARY

                      The installation defines the logical DTR$LIBRARY
                      as SYS$COMMON:[DTR]. If the installation fails,
                      DTR$LIBRARY may be left deassigned, and you must
                      redefine it. To redefine the logical, use the

              1.6.4 More than One Installation of this Version of DEC
                    DATATRIEVE

                      You can install this version of DEC DATATRIEVE
                      a number of times to produce different sets of
                      images and files. Note, however, that you cannot
                      install multiple versions of the product, such
                      as both Version 6.0 and Version 6.1. For example,
                      the installation procedure could be run first
                      to install DEC DATATRIEVE Version 6.1 with VAX
                      TDMS. You can install DEC DATATRIEVE Version 6.1
                      a second time to support FMS. (Note that DECforms
                      is supported by default whenever available on the
                      system.) The resulting images and file names are
                      differentiated by a suffix added to the default
                      names. The installation procedure prompts you to
                      choose this suffix.

                      The suffix you specify will be given to the
                      following files created during installation. The
                      two letters xx at the end of a file name stand
                      for the 1- to 26-character suffix you specify:

              2       DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure



                      Before you install DEC DATATRIEVE Version 6.1,
                      make sure that your system meets all requirements
                      listed in Chapter 1.

                      Your Version 6.1 installation kit consists of one
                      magnetic tape or TK50. This medium makes obsolete
                      the distribution media for any lower version of
                      DEC DATATRIEVE.

                      DEC DATATRIEVE is also available on CDROM. If you
                      are installing DEC DATATRIEVE from CDROM, follow
                      the directions in the documentation packaged with
                      the CDROM kit.

                      The installation procedure is described in the
                      sections that follow. Note that as the procedure
                      progresses, the installation command procedure
                      sends questions to your screen to guide you
                      through the installation process. The sections
                      that follow explain these questions in detail.

                      On OpenVMS VAX operating systems, after
                      you answer questions from the installation
                      procedure, installation of DEC DATATRIEVE takes
                      approximately 20 to 40 minutes.

                      On OpenVMS AXP operating systems, after
                      you answer questions from the installation
                      procedure, installation of DEC DATATRIEVE takes
                      approximately 10 to 20 minutes.

              __________________________________________________________
              2.1 Starting the Installation Procedure

                      To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL
                      command procedure from a privileged account.
                      VMSINSTAL is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. Use the
                      following format to invoke VMSINSTAL.

                      @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL save-set-name device-name OPTIONS N

                                                                     2-1

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      save-set-name

                      The name of the DEC DATATRIEVE save set you want
                      to install:

                      On OpenVMS VAX operating systems, enter DTR061 to
                      install DEC DATATRIEVE Version 6.1.

                      On OpenVMS AXP operating systems, enter DTRAXP061
                      to install DEC DATATRIEVE Version 6.1.


































                      2-2

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      device-name

                      The name of the device on which you plan to mount
                      the media. For example, MTA0: is the device name
                      for a tape drive. It is not necessary to use the
                      console drive for this installation. However, if
                      you do use the console drive, you should replace
                      any media you have removed once the installation
                      is complete. If you are installing DEC DATATRIEVE
                      from a CD, you must specify a device-name and a
                      directory name. The directory name should be the
                      same as the save set name.

                      OPTIONS N

                      An optional parameter that indicates you want to
                      review the release notes questions (see Section
                      2.3 for more information).

                      The following example and the rest of this
                      chapter show how to install DEC DATATRIEVE
                      Version 6.1 for OpenVMS VAX from CDROM DKA400.
                      This example uses the OPTIONS N release note
                      parameter.

                      $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DTR061 DKA400:[DTR061] OPTIONS N

                      If you do not supply any parameter, VMSINSTAL
                      prompts you for the information later in the
                      installation procedure.

                      Note that you can specify the AUTOANSWERBACK
                      option when you invoke VMSINSTAL. This option
                      creates the file SYS$UPDATE:DTR061.ANS,
                      which contains the installation questions and
                      your responses. This file can then be used
                      in subsequent installations. (The OpenVMS
                      documentation on software installation contains
                      more information about VMSINSTAL.)

                      The AUTOANSWERBACK option is not recommended for
                      DEC DATATRIEVE installations. Questions asked
                      during the DEC DATATRIEVE installation are based
                      on the system environment. The system environment
                      at the time of the original installation
                      determines which questions the installation
                      procedure will ask. When you proceed with a

                                                                     2-3

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      subsequent installation, the questions change
                      according to changes in the system environment.
                      Thus, if you specify AUTOANSWERBACK during the
                      original installation, you probably will not
                      receive the appropriate questions during the
                      subsequent installation.

                      The installation procedure prompts you for input
                      at various times. Whenever you are prompted for
                      input, you can type a question mark (?) symbol
                      for help.

                      Most installation prompts include a default
                      response in brackets. To enter the default
                      bracketed response, you can either explicitly
                      enter that response or press the RETURN key.

                      Before the installation procedure begins,
                      VMSINSTAL checks if you are logged in to the
                      system account. If not, you receive this warning
                      message:

                      %VMSINSTAL-W-NOTSYSTEM, You are not logged in to the
                      system account.

                      In addition, before the installation procedure
                      begins, VMSINSTAL checks for active processes on
                      the system. If your DECnet network is running,
                      you receive this warning message:

                      %VMSINSTAL-W-DECNET, Your DECnet network is up and running.

                      If there are still users on the system, you
                      receive this warning message with a list of
                      process names:

                      %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:

                                                .
                                                .
                                                .

                      The list of the process names is followed by this
                      question:

                      * Do you want to continue anyway? [NO]

                      If you want to stop the installation process to allow all
                      users to exit the system, enter N or press the RETURN key.

                      2-4

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      At the start of the VMSINSTAL procedure, you need to
                      answer the following question:

                      * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                      After you have performed the necessary backup,
                      enter Y or press the RETURN key. If you reply
                      with N, the installation stops.

              __________________________________________________________
              2.2 Mounting the Distribution Medium

                      You should now mount the first distribution
                      volume on the device you have specified when
                      you invoked VMSINSTAL.

                      VMSINSTAL displays the following message:

                      Please mount the first volume of the set on DKA400:

                      * Are you ready?

                      Type Y after you mount the distribution medium.

                      The installation procedure then checks if
                      the following necessary conditions for the
                      installation have been fulfilled:

                      o  The target of the installation is SYS$COMMON on
                         the system-rooted device.

                      o  A compatible version of OpenVMS is installed.

                      o  At least 37,000 blocks are available on the
                         system disk (74,000 blocks are required if you
                         install DEC DATATRIEVE on OpenVMS AXP systems).

                      o  A compatible version of CDD/Repository is
                         installed on the system.

                      o  The installation procedure has ACL access
                         rights to CDD$TOP.

                      If any of these conditions has not been
                      fulfilled, the installation procedure displays a
                      message describing the problem. After satisfying
                      the requirement, you can rerun the installation
                      procedure by invoking the command procedure
                      VMSINSTAL again.

                                                                     2-5

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                                             Note

                         Systems that do not have DECnet cannot
                         support the DEC DATATRIEVE remote server.
                         On such systems, the installation procedure
                         next displays a message noting that it
                         cannot define a DECnet object for the remote
                         server. If you later install DECnet, you
                         will then need to define a DECnet object for
                         the remote server. See Section 3.5 for more
                         information.

                      This ends the initial series of questions
                      generated by VMSINSTAL. If you have successfully
                      completed this portion of the installation, a
                      message similar to the following is displayed:

                      The following products will be processed:

                        DTR Version 6.1

                          Beginning installation of DTR Version 6.1 at 8:15

                      VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

                      The installation continues with questions about
                      release notes.

              __________________________________________________________
              2.3 Answering Questions About Release Notes

                      If you have specified the qualifier OPTIONS N at
                      the beginning of the installation, the procedure
                      offers these options regarding DEC DATATRIEVE
                      Version 6.1 online release notes:

                      Release Notes Options:

                      1.  Display release notes
                      2.  Print release notes
                      3.  Both 1 and 2
                      4.  Do not display, print or copy release notes

                      * Select option [2]:

                      Enter the number corresponding to the option you
                      choose. If you enter option 2 or 3, the procedure
                      prompts you for the printer queue name. It then
                      prints a message showing that the job has been
                      queued for printing.

                      The procedure now asks if you want to continue
                      the installation.

                      you must wait until the release notes finish
                      printing before you enter N or press the RETURN
                      key. If you have not selected a print option and
                      wish to exit, enter N or press the RETURN key.

                  Facility (LMF)

                      DEC DATATRIEVE Version 6.1 supports the License
                      Management facility provided by OpenVMS. The
                      installation procedure asks whether you have
                      registered and loaded a Product Authorization Key
                      (PAK) as required.

                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      If you answer Y or YES, the procedure continues.
                      If you answer N or NO, you receive the following
                      message:

                      You have not registered the LMF authorization key as required.
                      The DEC DATATRIEVE installation will continue.  However, you
                      cannot run the product until you register the license
                      authorization key.

                      When the DEC DATATRIEVE installation is
                      completed, please register the authorization
                      key using the following command:

                      $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE

                      The IVP cannot be run until the authorization key
                      is registered. However, the IVP command file will
                      be put in the same directory as the UETPs. Once
                      you register the authorization key, you may run
                      the IVP by entering DEC DATATRIEVE and issuing
                      the following command:

                      @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR]DTR$IVP.COM

                      The installation continues with a series of DEC
                      DATATRIEVE questions.

              2.5 Answering Questions During the DEC DATATRIEVE
                  Installation

                      The installation procedure asks you a number of
                      questions concerning default installation, forms
                      management products, multiple DEC DATATRIEVE
                      installations, and DEC DATATRIEVE files. The
                      following sections give examples of these
                      questions.

              2.5.1 Installing DEC DATATRIEVE with the Default Answers

                      The installation procedure now asks if you want
                      to install DEC DATATRIEVE using default answers
                      for all questions.

                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                         appropriate for your situation. For
                         example, if your system supports more
                         than one installation of this version
                         of DEC DATATRIEVE, you should not select
                         the default installation option. Read
                         the summary of the default responses that
                         follows the question before you choose this
                         option.

                      The installation procedure prompts you with the
                      following question:

                      *Do you want to use default answers for all questions [Yes]?

                      If you type Y, the DEC DATATRIEVE installation
                      procedure automatically does the following:

                      o  Performs a complete installation of DEC
                         DATATRIEVE; it will not allow a partial
                         installation to provide DEC DATATRIEVE support
                         for LSE.

                      o  Checks your system for a forms management
                         product (FMS or VAX TDMS). If DEC DATATRIEVE
                         does not find either of them, the automatic
                         installation procedure provides support only
                         for DECforms, if this is available on the
                         system.

                         If either FMS or VAX TDMS already exists on the
                         system, DEC DATATRIEVE in addition to DECforms
                         support:

                         - Supplies FMS support, if only FMS is on the
                           system

                         - Supplies VAX TDMS support, if only VAX TDMS
                           is on the system

                         - Supplies VAX TDMS support, if both FMS and
                           VAX TDMS are found on the system

                      o  Does not prompt you for the unique 1- to
                         26-character suffix that identifies the
                         DTR32xx.EXE image of this installation. Note
                         that if you have already installed this version
                         of DEC DATATRIEVE and have not supplied a
                         suffix during that installation, you will need

                                                                     2-9

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                         a suffix to differentiate the image of the
                         previous installation from the image currently
                         being installed. In such a case, the default
                         installation procedure is not appropriate.

                      o  Does not prompt you for the default image to
                         be used with the DATATRIEVE DCL command and DCL
                         help. The default image will be DTR32.

                      o  Checks if the DEC DATATRIEVE remote server has
                         been defined by a previous installation of DEC
                         DATATRIEVE. The DEC DATATRIEVE remote server
                         is called the Distributed Data Manipulation
                         Facility (DDMF).

                         When the installation procedure checks for a
                         previously defined DDMF:

                         o If there is no remote server or if the
                           remote server is obsolete, the DDMF files
                           from this installation become the remote
                           server for DEC DATATRIEVE.

                         o If there is a current remote server already
                           on the system, the default installation
                           procedure uses that as the remote server for
                           this installation of DEC DATATRIEVE.

                      o  Copies the NEWUSER.COM file in DTR$LIBRARY.

                      o  Checks the status of the DCL help for DEC
                         DATATRIEVE. If DCL help is unavailable or out-
                         of-date, DEC DATATRIEVE automatically updates
                         DCL help.

                      o  Installs DTRSHR.EXE, DTRMSGS.EXE, DTR32.EXE,
                         and DDMF.EXE (if applicable) as SHARED.

                      o  Installs DTRHELP as SHARED.

                      o  Supplies the plot definitions for the current
                         version.

                      o  Does not supply the optional text and
                         message files, sample programs, and callable
                         programming aids that can be tailored at the
                         installed site.

                      If you type N, the installation procedure
                      continues with the questions about LSE.

              _____________________________
              2.5.2 Installing with LSE Support

                      To use LSE with DEC DATATRIEVE , LSE must already
                      be installed and licensed on your system. If LSE
                      is not already installed on your system, you see
                      the following message on your screen:

                      The LSE Editor is not installed on your
                      system.  To have LSE support, you must:

                          1.  Install the LSE Editor
                          2.  Install or reinstall this product

                      *********************************************************

                      * Do you want to continue the installation [No]?

                      If you enter Y or YES, the installation
                      continues; however, you will not be able to
                      use LSE with DEC DATATRIEVE. If you enter the
                      default value by entering N, NO, or by pressing
                      the RETURN key, the installation aborts, giving
                      you the opportunity to install LSE on your
                      system. Once LSE is installed, you can begin the
                      DEC DATATRIEVE installation procedure from the
                      beginning. If LSE is already installed on your
                      system, you will be prompted with the following:

                      LSE is installed on your system.

                      You now have the following options:

                      1.  Do a complete DEC DATATRIEVE installation including
                          DEC DATATRIEVE support for LSE.

                      2.  Do only DEC DATATRIEVE support for LSE without
                          installing DEC DATATRIEVE.

                      3.  Do a DEC DATATRIEVE installation without including
                          DEC DATATRIEVE support for LSE.

                                                                    2-11

                      If you want to install a new version of DEC
                      DATATRIEVE (including LSE support), select option
                      1. If you want only to provide DEC DATATRIEVE
                      support for LSE (without installing a new version
                      of DEC DATATRIEVE), select option 2. If you
                      want to install a new version of DEC DATATRIEVE
                      without LSE support, select option 3. If you
                      select option 2, this installation will terminate
                      after DEC DATATRIEVE support for LSE is provided.

              _____________________________
              2.5.3 Installing with Support for Forms Products

                      Each installation of DEC DATATRIEVE on a system
                      can support two forms management products:

                      o  DECforms

                      o  FMS (Forms Management System) or VAX TDMS
                         (Terminal Data Management System)

                      DECforms software is dynamically loaded at
                      runtime and no specific operations are required
                      at installation time. This means that DECforms,
                      whenever installed on the system, is always
                      available, while FMS and VAX TDMS are optional
                      and mutually exclusive. You select DEC FMS or VAX
                      TDMS at installation time.

                      A series of questions determines which product
                      DEC DATATRIEVE will support for the image
                      currently being installed.

                      The installation procedure checks which forms
                      management products are on the system. If
                      no forms products are found (or only lower
                      versions of VAX TDMS or FMS not supported by DEC
                      DATATRIEVE are found), the installation procedure
                      displays the following message:



                      2-12

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      *********************************************************

                      Neither FMS nor VAX TDMS product has been found
                      on this system. If desired, the installation may be
                      aborted at this point to install either FMS or
                      VAX TDMS. If the installation continues, DEC DATATRIEVE
                      will be built with DECforms support only.
                      The DECforms support will be automatically available,
                      provided that DECforms is installed and licensed by
                      the time DEC DATATRIEVE is invoked.

                      *********************************************************

                      * Do you wish to continue with the installation [YES]?

                      If you type Y or press the RETURN key, the
                      installation continues with the series of
                      questions about more than one installation of
                      this version of DEC DATATRIEVE. (See Section
                      2.5.4 for more information.)

                      If you type N, the installation aborts, giving
                      you an opportunity to install a forms product on
                      your system.

                      If one or more forms products are found, you
                      receive a listing of the products on your system,
                      followed by a message and question similar to the
                      following:

                          DEC DATATRIEVE can be built to support any one
                          of these products, or, if desired, DEC DATATRIEVE
                          can be built without support of any of these Forms
                          Management products.

                      * Do you want DEC DATATRIEVE to support one of these
                      products [YES]?

                      If you do not want forms support, enter N. The
                      installa- tion procedure resumes with questions
                      on suffixes and more than one installation of
                      this version of DEC DATATRIEVE.

                      If you do want forms support, enter Y or press
                      the RETURN key. Then, for each forms product
                      on the system, you are asked if you want DEC
                      DATATRIEVE to support this forms product.
                      Remember each installation of DEC DATATRIEVE

                                                                    2-13

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      can support only one forms product in addition
                      to DECforms. After you enter Y to specify
                      support for one forms product, you do not receive
                      questions about the other forms products.

                      For example, if you have both VAX TDMS and FMS
                      on the system, you receive the following question
                      first:

                      * Do you wish to have VAX TDMS Forms Management support [YES]?

                      If you type Y or press the RETURN key, the DEC
                      DATATRIEVE image being installed will support
                      VAX TDMS. Then the installation procedure moves
                      on to a series of questions on suffixes and more
                      than one installation of this version of DEC
                      DATATRIEVE.

                      If you type N, you receive a question about
                      support for FMS.

                      If you type N after each question in the series,
                      you receive the following message:

                          There are neither FMS nor VAX TDMS Forms
                          Management products on this system. If desired, the
                          installation may be aborted at this point to install
                          either FMS or VAX TDMS. If the installation
                          continues, the questions pertaining to the selection of
                          a Forms Management product will be asked again.

                      * Do you wish to continue with the installation [YES]?

                      If you type Y or press the RETURN key, you have
                      another opportunity to answer questions about
                      forms. If you type N, the installation procedure
                      aborts.

              2.5.4 Specifying Suffixes for More than One Installation
                    of This Version of DEC DATATRIEVE

                      The installation procedure asks whether you
                      intend to complete more than one installation
                      of this version of DEC DATATRIEVE on your system,
                      as follows:

                      2-14

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                        It is possible to do more than one installation of
                        DEC DATATRIEVE.  More than one installation of a
                        single version may be desirable for a number of reasons
                        including:

                            o  Use of multiple forms management products (such as
                                               FMS and VAX TDMS; DECforms is available in
                                               every image, if present on the system)

                            o  Use of multiple foreign language translations of
                                               DEC DATATRIEVE (such as French or German)

                      * Do you plan to install this version more than once [NO]?

                      If you type N or press the RETURN key, the
                      installation procedure continues with questions
                      about retaining DEC DATATRIEVE files. (See
                      Section 3.4 for more information.) At a later
                      date, you can decide to install DEC DATATRIEVE
                      using file names other than the defaults by
                      typing Y in response to the previous question.

                      If you type Y, the installation procedure
                      displays messages requesting that you specify
                      a suffix for the image you are installing and the
                      default image for the DCL command DATATRIEVE.

                      The following message and question about the
                      suffix are displayed:

                          To differentiate the files and images produced by this
                          installation from those produced by some other
                          DEC DATATRIEVE installation, it is necessary to append a
                          suffix to some of the file and image names. For each
                          installation of this version of DEC DATATRIEVE, this suffix
                          should be unique. This suffix can be 1 to 26 characters.

                      * What is the suffix you intend to use for this
                      installation [none]?

                      Only one set of DEC DATATRIEVE images and files
                      can use the default file names that have no
                      suffix. (See Section 1.6.4 for a list of these
                      images and files.) If you install this version
                      of DEC DATATRIEVE a second or subsequent time,
                      you should identify the subsequent image and file
                      names by a unique suffix. This step allows you

                                                                    2-15

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      later to identify which version of DEC DATATRIEVE
                      you want to run.

                      For example, on the first run through the
                      installation procedure, you could respond to
                      the question about the suffix by pressing the
                      RETURN key. The result is that each of the DEC
                      DATATRIEVE file names includes no suffix. To run
                      the image produced by this procedure, type:

                      $ DATATRIEVE

                      During the second or subsequent installation of
                      this version of DEC DATATRIEVE, for example,
                      you might use VAX TDMS as the forms product
                      supported by this image. You could identify the
                      files and images by responding with VAX TDMS for
                      the suffix. To run the image produced by this
                      procedure, type the following line:

                                 $ DATATRIEVE/VARIANT=XX

                      For the remainder of this manual, the two letters
                      xx at the end of a file name stand for the 1- to
                      26-character suffix you specify.

                      If you specify the same suffix for a later
                      installation, the later image supersedes
                      the previous image installed with the same
                      suffix. If you choose to purge files during
                      the installation, those earlier images will be
                      deleted. See Section 2.5.9 for more information.

                      The following message and question are displayed:

                          The DATATRIEVE DCL command allows you to choose which DTR32
                          image to execute by means of the /VARIANT qualifier.  You
                          may now choose an image to be executed by default, when the
                          /VARIANT qualifier is not specified on the DATATRIEVE
                          command. This default image will be the image referenced
                          by DCL HELP.

                      DTR32, DTR32xx

                      * Which of the above images should be the default [DTR32xx]:

                      2-16

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      The installation procedure checks which DEC
                      DATATRIEVE images are on the system. All existing
                      image names, plus the name of the image you are
                      currently installing, are listed. The current
                      image name is provided as the default response to
                      the question.

                      Only one DEC DATATRIEVE image can be chosen as
                      the default for the DCL command DATATRIEVE. You
                      must use the /VARIANT qualifier to invoke any
                      other DEC DATATRIEVE image using the DCL command
                      DATATRIEVE.

                      For example, on the first run through the
                      installation procedure, you could respond to both
                      the question about the suffix and the question
                      about the DCL default by pressing the RETURN key.
                      The result is that the image name is DTR32 and
                      that image is the default when you invoke DEC
                      DATATRIEVE using the DCL command DATATRIEVE as
                      follows:

                      $DATATRIEVE

                      During the second or subsequent installation
                      of this version of DEC DATATRIEVE, you might
                      choose VAX TDMS as the suffix. You might then
                      choose DTR32 as the default image name with
                      the DCL command DATATRIEVE. You can use the DCL
                      command DATATRIEVE to invoke the DTR32TDMS image
                      as follows:

                      $DATATRIEVE/VARIANT=TDMS

                      If, however, you choose DTR32TDMS as the default
                      with the DATATRIEVE DCL command, you must use the
                      VARIANT qualifier to invoke the DTR32 image as
                      follows:

                      $DATATRIEVE/VARIANT




                                                                    2-17

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure



              _____________________________
              2.5.5 Defining the DEC DATATRIEVE Remote Server

                      The installation procedure checks if the DEC
                      DATATRIEVE remote server has been defined by
                      previous installations of DEC DATATRIEVE. The
                      remote server for DEC DATATRIEVE is called the
                      Distributed Data Manipulation Facility (DDMF).
                      Although there can be several shareable images
                      of DEC DATATRIEVE installed on the same system,
                      there can be only one remote server for each
                      system.

                                             Note

                         You do not receive the question discussed
                         in this section if you are installing DEC
                         DATATRIEVE on a OpenVMS system without
                         DECnet. If you later install DECnet, you
                         then need to define a DECnet object for
                         the remote server. See Section 3.5 for more
                         information on defining a DECnet object.
                      If no remote server has been defined previously
                      or if a previously-defined remote server is
                      obsolete, the DDMF files from this installation
                      become the remote server for DEC DATATRIEVE on
                      the system. You do not receive a question about
                      the remote server, and the installation procedure
                      continues with questions about the file for new
                      users. See Section 2.5.6 for more information.

                      However, if an up-to-date remote server has
                      already been defined (by a previous installation
                      of this DEC DATATRIEVE release, for example), the
                      installation procedure asks if the remote server
                      established by the current installation should
                      be the remote server for the system. The DECnet
                      object number for DDMF is defined as 30 by the
                      installation procedure. You receive the following
                      question:

                      * Do you want DDMFxx.EXE to be used for distributed access [NO]?



                      2-18

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      Type Y if you want the remote server (DDMF)
                      established by the current installation to be
                      the remote server for your system. You might want
                      to type Y if this image will contain options
                      that users on remote systems need to access
                      frequently, for example, user-defined functions
                      that PDP-11 users need to access. In such cases,
                      it is more efficient to make the remote server
                      file for this image the remote server for your
                      system.

                      Type N or press the RETURN key if these
                      considerations do not apply to this installation
                      of DEC DATATRIEVE.

              _____________________________
              2.5.6 Creating a DCL Command File for New Users

                      The installation procedure now copies the
                      new user file, NEWUSER.COM, to DTR$LIBRARY.
                      NEWUSER.COM helps new users get started with
                      DEC DATATRIEVE by providing the necessary files
                      to perform the examples in the DEC DATATRIEVE
                      documentation set. Users can invoke the NEWUSER
                      command file by entering:

                      $ @DTR$LIBRARY:NEWUSER

                      This procedure copies the DEC DATATRIEVE data
                      files from DTR$LIBRARY to your directory and
                      creates the DEC DATATRIEVE objects in your
                      CDD/Repository dictionary.

              _____________________________
              2.5.7 Installing Shared Images

                      DEC DATATRIEVE runs most efficiently when
                      all its executable images are installed as
                      shareable images. The installation procedure
                      lets you choose not to do so, however. The
                      installation procedure prompts you with
                      the following question. Note that the file
                      SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM is built according
                      to your responses.

                                                                    2-19

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      * Do you want DTRSHRxx.EXE and DTRMSGS.EXE to be installed
                      SHARED [YES]?

                      For best performance, the images DTRSHRxx.EXE and
                      DTRMSGS.EXE should be installed as SHARED. Type Y
                      or press the RETURN key if you want these images
                      to be installed as SHARED.

                      The second question about shareable images refers
                      to DTR32xx.EXE. For best performance, this should
                      also be installed as SHARED.

                                 * Do you want DTR32xx.EXE to be installed SHARED [YES]?

                      Type Y or press the RETURN key if you want this
                      image to be installed SHARED.

                      For best performance in environments where you
                      anticipate extensive use of the distributed
                      features of DEC DATATRIEVE, the image DDMFxx.EXE
                      should also be installed as SHARED. If the
                      DDMF from this installation is to be the remote
                      server, you receive the following question:

                       * Do you want DDMFxx.EXE to be installed SHARED [YES]?

                      Type Y or press the RETURN key if you want this
                      image to be installed as SHARED.

                                             Note

                         You do not receive the question about
                         DDMFxx.EXE if you are installing DEC
                         DATATRIEVE on a system that does not have
                         DECnet. If you later install DECnet, see
                         Section 3.5 for instructions on running the
                         DDMFxx.EXE image as SHARED.

              2.5.8 Installing Plot Definitions and Optional Material

                      The installation procedure continues with
                      a question about plot definitions for DEC
                      DATATRIEVE graphics. DEC DATATRIEVE contains
                      graphics features you can use with a VT125,
                      VT240, VT330, or VT340 terminal or on a
                      workstation. To use these features, you must
                      request plot definitions during installation.

                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                                             Note

                         If this is your first installation of DEC
                         DATATRIEVE since Version 3.4, you must
                         answer Y to the following question. The
                         plot definitions were modified with Version
                         4.0. Plot definitions provided with DEC
                         DATATRIEVE installations prior to Version
                         4.0 are not compatible with DEC DATATRIEVE
                         Version 6.1.

                      The following question is displayed:

                      * Do you wish to have the plot definitions [YES]?

                      Type Y or press the RETURN key if you want
                      the installation procedure to include plot
                      definitions. The plot definitions are installed
                      in a CDD/Repository DMU dictionary, in
                      CDD$TOP.DTR$LIB.PLOTS. They replace the plot
                      definitions of lower versions.

                      The next question pertains to components of
                      DEC DATATRIEVE that can be tailored at the
                      installation site. This optional material
                      includes Data Access Blocks files (used with
                      Callable DEC DATATRIEVE), the DEC DATATRIEVE
                      message file (necessary for customizing DEC
                      DATATRIEVE messages), sample programs and the
                      files necessary for creating and maintaining
                      user-defined functions.

                      The following message and question are displayed:

                          Some optional material is available with this kit including
                          the components of DEC DATATRIEVE that can be tailored at
                          the installed site.

                      * Do you want the optional material [NO]?

                      Type Y if you want this material. The
                      installation procedure loads these files in
                      DTR$LIBRARY. If you do not want this material,
                      type N or press the RETURN key.

                                                                    2-21

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      After you respond to this question, the
                      installation procedure continues with a question
                      about purging files replaced by the installation
                      procedure.

              _____________________________
              2.5.9 Purging Files

                      The installation procedure continues with the
                      following question:

                      * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

                      If you wish, you can have all files that were
                      created by this installation procedure purged in
                      the various directories where they were created.
                      No files are purged except those created in this
                      installation. Type Y or press the RETURN key to
                      purge the files.

              2.5.10 Running the IVP

                      The last question regarding the installation
                      concerns the IVP. You can choose whether to
                      run the IVP after the installation or not. The
                      following message is displayed:

                          The DEC DATATRIEVE IVP will be put in the
                          SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR] directory. You may run the IVP
                          immediately after the completion of the installation procedure
                          answering YES to the next question or later issuing the
                          following command:

                          @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR]DTR$IVP.COM DTRxx.EXE

                      * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?
                      * Proceed with this installation [YES]?

                                             Note

                         The PAK must be registered before either the
                         IVP or any of the UETPs can be run. If you
                         answered no to the following question, the
                         message about IVP will not be displayed and
                         the IVP will not be run at this time:

              __________________________________________________________
              2.6 Finishing the Installation

                      If you did not request the default installation,
                      the following message is displayed:

                      All questions regarding the installation have now been asked.

                      The installation of DEC DATATRIEVE will now continue for
                      20 minutes to 40 minutes.

                      If the DTRFNDxx.MAR file provided by this
                      installation is newer than an existing one, the
                      installation procedure will display the following
                      message:

                      An existing DTRFNDxx.MAR has been found
                      on the system, but its version does not
                      match the current level for this installation.
                      The existing DTRFNDxx.MAR and DTRFUNxx.OLB
                      have been respectively renamed to
                      DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFNDxx.OLD and
                      DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFUNxx.OLD.

                      See Section 3.6 for more information on
                      maintaining user-defined functions.

                      During installation, you should receive the
                      following message:

                      During the installation, a file called
                      DTRSTUPxx.COM has been added to SYS$STARTUP:
                      The site-dependent startup file, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM,
                      should have the following line added:

                           $ @SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM

                      Be sure to update SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM after
                      installation.

                      On OpenVMS VAX systems Version 5.4 or earlier,
                      the file SYSTARTUP.COM is called SYSTARTUP_
                      V5.COM.

                                                                    2-23

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE Installation Procedure




                      The installation procedure next displays
                      information about User Environment Test Packages
                      (UETPs). The installation provides up to five
                      UETPs, depending on the optional products already
                      on the system (VAX TDMS, FMS, DEC DBMS, DEC Rdb)
                      and your responses to the questions about forms
                      products and plots. Besides a general test of
                      DEC DATATRIEVE, there are also UETPs for plots,
                      forms, DEC Rdb, and DEC DBMS.

                      The installation displays a message showing how
                      to invoke each UETP it provides:

                      *************************************************************

                      DEC DATATRIEVE User Environment Test Packages (UETPs)
                      have been provided and can be run after the installation is
                      complete.  They are invoked from DEC DATATRIEVE as follows:

                      DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]DTR         ! The general test
                      DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]plots       ! The plots test
                      DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]dbms        ! The DEC DBMS test
                      DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]rdb         ! The DEC Rdb test
                      DTR> @sys$common:[systest.dtr]forms       ! The Forms test

                      Before invoking these files from a user's account you must
                      execute the procedure :

                                  @DTR$LIBRARY:NEWUSER.COM

                      This procedure loads the DEC DATATRIEVE definitions into the
                      user's dictionary and the data files in the user's directory.
                      This procedure must be executed by each user needing
                      the DEC DATATRIEVE examples.

                      *************************************************************

                      The file type for the UETP files in the directory
                      SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR] is .DTR.

                      Chapter 4 discusses the test packages.

                      The installation procedure now runs the general
                      IVP test and, if you have chosen to run the IVP
                      after the installation, it displays the following

              3       Postinstallation Considerations



                      This chapter discusses some important
                      postinstallation considerations concerning
                      DECnet, relational databases, DEC DBMS databases
                      and user-defined functions.

              __________________________________________________________
              3.1 Updating SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM

                      During installation, a file called DTRSTUPxx.COM
                      was added to SYS$STARTUP. Note that xx represents
                      the 1- to 26- character suffix you specify
                      during installation. After installation, you
                      must update the site-dependent startup file
                      SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP.COM by adding the following
                      line:

                      $ @SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM

              __________________________________________________________
              3.2 VAXcluster Considerations (VAX Only)

                      If you are installing DEC DATATRIEVE on a
                      VAXcluster, the shareable image created by this
                      installation of DEC DATATRIEVE is available only
                      from the node where the installation is done.
                      Therefore, after the installation is complete,
                      you should repeat the following steps on each
                      of the other nodes in the VAXcluster where DEC
                      DATATRIEVE will be used:

                      1  Issue the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the
                         OpenVMS license.

                      2  Execute the DEC DATATRIEVE startup command file
                         as follows:

                         $ @SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM

                                                                     3-1

 





                      Postinstallation Considerations




                      3  Install the new version of DCLTABLES.EXE that
                         has been updated to include the DCL command
                         DATATRIEVE. Install the file as follows:

                                       $ INSTALL
                                       INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES

                      The second step is not necessary if you plan
                      to reboot the entire VAXcluster after the
                      installation is complete.

              __________________________________________________________
              3.3 Updating Process Command Tables

                      The DEC DATATRIEVE Version 6.1 installation

                      the DCL command DATATRIEVE. To use the DCL
                      command DATATRIEVE, users must log out of their
                      processes and log back in to update their process

              3.4 Online DEC DATATRIEVE Object Library

                      The installation keeps the library online in case
                      it is necessary to relink a DEC DATATRIEVE image.

                      You may have to relink DEC DATATRIEVE if you:

                      o  Add a user-defined function.

                      o  Customize the text file DTRTEXT.MAR.

                      o  Install or patch a new version of
                         CDD/Repository. (Check the CDD/Repository
                         documentation to see if relinking is
                         necessary.)

                      o  Install a new version of the OpenVMS Run-Time
                         Library.

                      o  Install a new version of FMS.

                      You may enter the following command to relink DEC
                      DATATRIEVE:

              3.5 DECnet Considerations

                      This section describes what you need to do to
                      run the DEC DATATRIEVE remote server if DECnet
                      is installed after DEC DATATRIEVE on a OpenVMS
                      system. It also describes how to create a default
                      DECnet account for remote users of DEC DATATRIEVE
                      on your system.

              _____________________________
              3.5.1 Defining a DECnet Object

                      DECnet is normally installed on a OpenVMS system.
                      Unless you install DEC DATATRIEVE on a OpenVMS
                      system without DECnet, the installation procedure
                      automatically defines a DECnet object for the DEC
                      DATATRIEVE remote server.

                      However, if you install DEC DATATRIEVE on a
                      OpenVMS system that does not have DECnet, the
                      installation procedure cannot use the DECnet
                      Network Control Program (NCP) utility to define a
                      DECnet object.

                      This section describes how to use NCP to define a
                      DECnet object for the remote server if DECnet is
                      installed on your system after DEC DATATRIEVE is
                      installed.

                      The remote server for DEC DATATRIEVE is called
                      the Distributed Data Manipulation Facility
                      (DDMF). The installation procedure creates two
                      files, DDMFxx.EXE and DDMFxx.COM, in SYS$SYSTEM.
                      To define a DECnet object for DDMFxx.EXE and
                      assign it an object number of 30, type the
                      following commands:

                      $ NCP == "$NCP"
                      $ NCP DEFINE OBJECT DDMF NUMBER 30
                      $ NCP SET OBJECT DDMF NUMBER 30
                      $ NCP DEFINE OBJECT DDMF FILE DDMFxx.COM
                      $ NCP SET OBJECT DDMF FILE DDMFxx.COM


                                                                     3-3

 





                      Postinstallation Considerations




                      For best performance in environments where you
                      anticipate extensive use of the distributed
                      features of DEC DATATRIEVE, you should run
                      the remote server as SHARED. To run the image
                      DDMFxx.EXE as a SHARED image, edit the file
                      SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM. This file begins with
                      the following lines:

                      !+
                      $!   DEC DATATRIEVE Start-up File
                      $!-

                      Check the file for the following line and add it
                      if it is not already there:

                      $ DTR$INSTALL := $SYS$SYSTEM:INSTALL/COMMAND_MODE

                      You will see a dollar sign and the word exit at
                      the end of the file. Enter the following text on
                      the line above $ exit:

                      ADD/OPEN/SHARED SYS$SYSTEM:DDMFxx.EXE

              _____________________________
              3.5.2 Creating a Default DECnet Account for Distributed
                    Access

                      The installation procedure defines a DECnet
                      object called DDMF and assigns it the number 30.
                      After the installation, you may want to create
                      a default DECnet account, such as DTR$DECNET,
                      for this DECnet object. Remote users can then
                      omit the user name and password from the node
                      specification when accessing domains on your
                      node.

                                             Note

                         This section applies to systems on which
                         DECnet has been installed before DEC
                         DATATRIEVE. If DEC DATATRIEVE is installed
                         on a OpenVMS system that does not have
                         DECnet, you cannot define a default DECnet
                         account. If DECnet is installed afterwards,
                         you must define a DECnet object (see Section
                         3.5.1) before you can create a default
                         DECnet account.

                      3-4

 





                      Postinstallation Considerations




                      If you wish to set up such a default DECnet
                      account for distributed access, follow these
                      steps:

                      1  Add an entry to the user authorization file
                         (UAF) on your system for DTR$DECNET. Specify
                         the same file limits and quotas as you would
                         for any other DEC DATATRIEVE user.

                      2  Invoke NCP to associate DDMF (known object 30)
                         with the default DECnet account DTR$DECNET.
                         Use the DEFINE OBJECT command in NCP to modify
                         the object parameters for DDMF in the permanent
                         database on your system.

                      You can use the following sample session as a
                      model for your own system. Note that for security
                      reasons, you should use a different password than
                      the one provided. Also note that the UIC used
                      in the sample session is used to illustrate the
                      command; you should use a UIC that is appropriate
                      for your system.

              3.6 Maintaining User-Defined Functions

                      If this is your first installation of DEC
                      DATATRIEVE since Version 4.1, and if your
                      site maintains site-specific or user-defined
                      functions, you should complete the following
                      steps to re-enable user-defined functions.

                      After an initial installation of DEC DATATRIEVE
                      Version 4.2 or higher, DEC DATATRIEVE will always
                      use the DTRFNDxx.MAR and DTRFUNxx.OLB files that
                      are on the system. You will no longer have to re-
                      create and relink DEC DATATRIEVE as described in
                      this section.

                      1  Transfer the user-defined function definitions
                         from DTRFNDxx.OLD (renamed during installation)
                         to DTRFNDxx.MAR. To do this, edit DTRFNDxx.MAR
                         and add the appropriate definitions. (Merely
                         renaming the old file does not enable user-
                         defined functions in the file. They must be
                         transferred to DTRFNDxx.MAR.)

                                                                     3-7

 





                      Postinstallation Considerations




                      2  Assemble DTRFNDxx.MAR with the MACRO command:

                         $ MACRO DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFNDxx.MAR

                         This command creates the object file
                         DTRFNDxx.OBJ.

                      3  Replace the object module in the function
                         library with the newly created object file:

                         $ LIBRARY/REPLACE DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFUNxx DTRFNDxx

                      4  Skip to the next step if the user-defined
                         functions for your site consist only of calls
                         to OpenVMS Run-Time Library routines. However,
                         if your site has user-defined functions that
                         call their own routines, there is an additional
                         step before relinking DEC DATATRIEVE. The
                         object files for those functions routines
                         must be inserted into the new version of the
                         function library.

                         There are two ways to do this:

                         o If the object files (.OBJ files) for the
                           routines are still available, insert them
                           directly into the function library:

                           $ LIBRARY/INSERT -
                           _$    DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFUNxx.OLB filename.OBJ

                         o If the object files for the routines are not
                           available, extract the modules from the old
                           function library before inserting them into
                           the new:

                           $ LIBRARY/EXTRACT=module-name/OUTPUT=filename.OBJ -
                           _$    DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFUNxx.OLD
                           $ LIBRARY/INSERT -
                           _$    DTR$LIBRARY:DTRFUNxx.OLB filename.OBJ

                      5  Relink DEC DATATRIEVE:

                         $ @DTR$LIBRARY:DTRBLDxx

                                                Note

                           If your site maintains no user-defined
                           functions, you may choose to delete the
                           .OLD files.

              3.7 Deleting Unused Files for DEC DATATRIEVE DECwindows
                  Support

                      If the DEC DATATRIEVE DECwindows interface
                      is not required at your site, you can delete
                      the following files after the DEC DATATRIEVE
                      installation has successfully completed:

                      o  SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]DTRHELP.EXE

                      o  SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP]DTRDECW$HELP.HLB

                      o  SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]VAX_DATATRIEVE.UID

                      o  SYS$COMMON:[DTR]REMOTE_DECTERM.COM

                      If you delete any of the DEC DATATRIEVE
                      DECwindows files, ensure that you delete all
                      of the listed files.

                      After the DEC DATATRIEVE DECwindows interface
                      files are deleted, remove all references to these
                      files from each of your SYS$STARTUP:DTRSTUPxx.COM
                      files.

              3.8 Getting Help and Reporting Problems

                      If you encounter a problem while using DEC
                      DATATRIEVE, report it to Digital. Depending on
                      the type of support you have and the nature of
                      the problem, take one of the following actions:

                      o  If you have a Software Product Services Support
                         Agreement, contact your Digital Customer
                         Support Center (CSC), either by telephone or
                         using the electronic means provided with your
                         support agreement (such as DSNlink). The CSC
                         provides telephone support for high-level
                         advisory and remedial assistance. When you
                         initially contact the CSC, please indicate the
                         following:

                         - The name (e.g. OpenVMS AXP) and the version
                           number of the operating system you are
                           using.

                                                                     3-9

 





                      Postinstallation Considerations




                         - The product name (DEC DATATRIEVE) and the
                           version number of DEC DATATRIEVE you are
                           using.

                         - The hardware system you are using, such as a
                           model number.

                         - A very brief description of the problem (one
                           sentence if possible).

                         - How critical the problem is.

                         When you submit information electronically or
                         are speaking on the phone to the appropriate
                         DEC DATATRIEVE support specialist, you can
                         provide more detailed information. This
                         includes the specific commands used to compile
                         and link the program, the error messages
                         displayed, and relevant detailed information
                         (possibly including source program listings).
                         Please attempt to narrow the cause of the
                         problem to a specific module or lines of code.

                         CSC personnel may ask for additional
                         information, such as listings of any command
                         files, INCLUDE files, relevant data files,
                         and so forth. If the program is longer than 50
                         lines, submit a copy of it electronically or
                         provide machine-readable media (floppy diskette
                         or magnetic tape).

                      o  If you have a Self-Maintenance Software
                         Agreement, you can submit a Software
                         Performance Report (SPR).

                      o  If you do not have any type of software
                         services support agreement and you have
                         purchased DEC DATATRIEVE within one year, you
                         can submit an SPR if you think the problem is
                         caused by a software error.

                      When you submit an SPR, please take the following
                      steps:

                      1  Describe as accurately as possible the
                         circumstances and state of the system when

                      3-10

 





                      Postinstallation Considerations




                         the problem occurs. In the description, please
                         provide:

                         - The version number of DEC DATATRIEVE being
                           used.

                         - The name and version number of the operating
                           system being used.

                         - A concise description of the problem with
                           specific examples. Include any error
                           messages displayed, the commands used to
                           compile and link the program, and so on.

                      2  Reduce the problem to as small a size as
                         possible.

                      3  Provide a listing of the program.

                      4  When you submit an SPR, remember to include
                         listings of any command files, INCLUDE files,
                         relevant data files, and so forth.

                      5  When you submit an SPR, if the program is
                         longer than 50 lines, submit a copy of it on
                         machine-readable media (floppy diskette or
                         magnetic tape). If necessary, also submit a
                         copy of the program library used to build the
                         application.

                      6  Report only one problem per SPR. This will
                         facilitate a faster response.

                      7  Mail the SPR package to Digital.

                      Many problem reports do not contain enough
                      information to duplicate or identify the problem.
                      Concise, complete information helps Digital
                      give you accurate and timely service to software
                      problems.

                      If the problem is related to DEC DATATRIEVE
                      documentation:

                      o  Depending on the severity of the problem, you
                         can choose to report the problem to the CSC,
                         if you have a Software Product Services Support
                         agreement.

                                                                    3-11

                         form (located at the back of each manual).
                         If appropriate, include the section and page
                         number. Instead of using the Reader's Comments
                         form, you can send your comments about DEC

                      installation time.

              __________________________________________________________
              4.1_Asian_DEC_Datatrieve_V6.1 Features

              4.1.1 Single kit for Hanzi, Hanyu and Hangul

                      With the corresponding country PAK, users can
                      invoke Asian DEC Datatrieve to perform Hanzi,
                      Hanyu or Hangul data processing.

                      To invoke Asian DEC Datatrieve for a particular
                      character set, users can:

                      -  specify the character set in the command level,
                         i.e.

                         $DATA/CHARCTER_SET={HANYU | HANZI | HANGUL | MCS}

                      -  define the logical name DTR$CHAR_SET to
                         the character set before invoking Asian DEC
                         Datatrieve

                         Example:

                         To invoke Hanzi character set support:

                         $DEFINE DTR$CHAR_SET HANZI
                         $DATATRIEVE

                         or

                         To invoke Hanyu character set support:

                         $DEFINE DTR$CHAR_SET HANYU
                         $DATATRIEVE

                                                                     4-1

 





                      Asian DEC Datatrieve V6.1 Release Notes




                      -  define SYS$LANGUAGE to the character set before
                         invoking Asian DEC Datatrieve

                         Example:

                         To invoke Hangul character set support:

                         $DEFINE SYS$LANGUAGE KOREAN
                         $DATATRIEVE

                         or

                         To invoke MCS character set support:

                         $DEFINE SYS$LANAGUAGE ENGLISH
                         $DATATRIEVE

                      Any one of the three methods can start Asian
                      DEC Datatrieve with a particular character set
                      support.

              _____________________________
              4.1.2 Command Line Mode

                      Asian DEC DAtatrieve allows users to enter Asian
                      language characters in command line mode. With
                      this capability, users can enter English and
                      Asian language characters in the following:

                      -  character string data

                      -  data field query header for report generation

                      -  comment line for programmer documentation

              _____________________________
              4.1.3 Guide Mode

                      and English instructions to guide users creating
                      database record definitions. Users can choose
                      their preferred language.

                      Users can select the target language for
                      their use by setting the HANZIGEN, HANYUGEN or
                      HANGULGEN output device setting.

                      For example:

              4.2 Change in Application Programming Interface

                      To allow for Hanzi, Hanyu and Hangul character
                      supports in one single Asian DEC Datatrieve
                      image, the DTR$INIT API has an additional
                      parameter.

                              DTR$INIT( DAB           : REF $DCL_BLOCK (DAB),
                                        STACK_PAGES_REF,
                                        MSG_DESC      : REF BLOCK [,BYTE],
                                        AUX_DESC      : REF BLOCK [,BYTE],
                                        OPTIONS_REF,
                                        CSET_DESC     : REF BLOCK [,BYTE])

                      The 6th parameter, CSET_DESC, allows users to
                      specify one of the following local character sets
                      to be used in the subsequent DATATRIEVE session:

                      o  MCS

              4.3 Software Limitations


                      o  Asian DEC Datatrieve does not check if the
                         input and display device supports the desired
                         character set. You should ensure that the
                         correct device is used to input and display
                         the target character set.

                      o  Query_name in local characters is NOT
                         supported. Although users may still
                         successfully create query_name in some local
                         characters, its usage is not recommended.

                      o  If users receive the message %FORM-E-NOLAYOUT
                         when poping out a DECforms form, they can issue
                         the following command to reset the terminal
                         before invoking Datatrieve,

                         $ set terminal /inquire
                         $ datatrieve

              5       User Environment Test Packages



                      Five User Environment Test Packages (UETPs),
                      which show examples and test product interfaces,
                      are provided with DEC DATATRIEVE. You can run
                      the UETPs after you install DEC DATATRIEVE. The
                      following UETPs are provided with DEC DATATRIEVE:

                      o  DEC DATATRIEVE

                      o  DEC DATATRIEVE graphics capability

                      o  DEC DATATRIEVE and DEC DBMS interface

                      o  DEC DATATRIEVE and DEC Rdb interface

                      o  DEC DATATRIEVE and FMS or VAX TDMS interface

                      VAX DATATRIEVE User's Guide includes the data
                      definitions and procedures used in the UETPs.

                                             Note

                         o You must run the NEWUSER.COM file before
                           running any UETP.

                         o You must run the DEC DATATRIEVE UETP
                           before running any other UETP. The DEC
                           DATATRIEVE UETP creates data definitions
                           used by the other UETPs.

              __________________________________________________________
              5.1 Invoking DEC DATATRIEVE

                      To run the UETPs, you must first invoke DEC
                      DATATRIEVE in one of the following ways:

                      o  Use the DCL command DATATRIEVE, as follows:

                         $ DATATRIEVE

                                                                     5-1

 





                      User Environment Test Packages




                         The DCL command DATATRIEVE is useful if you
                         are working in a DECwindows environment.
                         You should not run the UETPs using the DEC
                         DATATRIEVE DECwindows interface, as you may get
                         unexpected results. By using the DATATRIEVE
                         command to invoke DEC DATATRIEVE, you can
                         specify the /INTERFACE=CHARACTER_CELL qualifier
                         to invoke DEC DATATRIEVE without the DECwindows
                         interface.

                         If you have installed more than one DEC
                         DATATRIEVE image, you can specify the
                         /VARIANT=image-suffix qualifier to run the
                         image of DEC DATATRIEVE you want to test.

                         To invoke DEC DATATRIEVE using these
                         qualifiers, enter the following command:

                         $ DATATRIEVE/INTERFACE=CHARACTER_CELL/VARIANT=xx

                         The characters xx represent the 1- to 26-
                         character suffix added at installation to
                         identify a particular image of DEC DATATRIEVE
                         Version 6.1.

                      o  Use the DCL command RUN as follows:

                         $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:DTR32xx.EXE

                         The xx represents the 1- to 26-character
                         optional suffix added to an image of DEC
                         DATATRIEVE at installation.

                      o  Use a symbol you have defined to represent the
                         RUN command. For example:

                         $ DTR32

                      At the DTR> prompt, enter the command to execute
                      the UETP you want to run. The UETPs and the
                      commands to invoke them are described in the
                      following sections.

              5.2 DEC DATATRIEVE UETP

                      To run the DEC DATATRIEVE UETP, invoke DEC
                      DATATRIEVE as described in Section 4.1 and type
                      the following command:

                      DTR> @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR]DTR

                      The DEC DATATRIEVE UETP is approximately 20 pages
                      long, so the entire UETP is not repeated here.

                      You respond to prompts during the DEC DATATRIEVE
                      UETP. The parts of the UETP that require a
                      response are included here along with suggested
                      responses. The responses you enter are printed in
                      colored ink.

                                             Note

                         The DEC DATATRIEVE UETP suggests at one
                         point that you use LP: to print a report
                         directly to a line printer. The LP: option
                         may not work unless LP is defined as the
                         system printer.

              5.6 DEC DATATRIEVE and Forms UETP

                      You need a VT52-, VT100-, VT200-, or VT300-
                      family terminal or a workstation to run the DEC
                      DATATRIEVE and forms UETP.

                      If DEC DATATRIEVE has been installed with support
                      for VAX TDMS or FMS, you can run the forms UETP
                      to test the forms interface.

                      To run the forms UETP, set your OpenVMS default
                      to a directory that contains YACHT.DAT and
                      OWNER.DAT. Be sure that you have WRITE access
                      (W) to these files. You can copy YACHT.DAT and
                      OWNER.DAT from the directory DTR$LIBRARY if you
                      do not have them in your directory. Then invoke
                      DEC DATATRIEVE as described in Section 4.1 and
                      type the following command:

                      DTR> @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.DTR]FORMS


                      5-14

 





                      User Environment Test Packages




                      When DEC DATATRIEVE uses a form to print records,
                      the screen clears before the first record is
                      printed. The DEC DATATRIEVE and forms UETP ask
                      you to enter a character and press RETURN before
                      each statement, causing the forms product to
                      erase the screen.

                      The following is a summary of the DEC DATATRIEVE
                      and forms UETP:

                      1  The UETP sends instructions to your screen
                         and waits for you to enter a character and
                         press RETURN. After you respond, the UETP
                         defines three domains that use the forms
                         product: YACHTS, SAILBOATS, and FAMILIES.
                         The definitions use forms libraries that are
                         located in DTR$LIBRARY.

                      2  The UETP readies YACHTS and prints a few
                         records without using the forms product. Then
                         the UETP sends more instructions to your screen
                         and waits for you to enter a character and
                         press RETURN. After you respond, the UETP
                         prints a record using the forms product. Press
                         RETURN after the forms product displays the
                         record.

                      3  The UETP sends instructions to your screen and
                         waits for you to enter a character and press
                         RETURN. After you respond, the UETP prints
                         several records using the forms product. Press
                         RETURN after the forms product displays each
                         record.

                      4  The UETP tests the STORE statement. The UETP
                         sends instructions to your screen and waits
                         for you to enter a character and press RETURN.
                         After you respond, the forms product puts a
                         form on the screen for you to fill in. To move
                         the cursor from one field to another, use the
                         TAB and BACK SPACE keys. The TAB key moves the
                         cursor to the next field; the BACK SPACE key
                         moves the cursor back to the previous field.
                         Help is also available for some fields if you
                         have trouble entering an acceptable value.

                                                                    5-15

 





                      User Environment Test Packages




                         Position the cursor on that field and press
                         the HELP key. After you fill in the form, press
                         RETURN.

                      5  The UETP tests the MODIFY statement controlling
                         the DISPLAY_FORM statement. The UETP sends
                         instructions to your screen and waits for you
                         to enter a character and press RETURN. After
                         you respond, the forms product displays the
                         first record for you to modify. Use the TAB
                         and BACK SPACE keys to move from one field to
                         another. Modify only the BEAM field in each
                         record. Any other modifications are not written
                         to the data file. After you modify each record,
                         press RETURN.

                      6  The UETP tests the PRINT statement again, using
                         the SAILBOATS view domain. The UETP waits for
                         you to enter a character and press RETURN
                         before each PRINT statement. After the forms
                         product displays the SAILBOAT records, the UETP
                         sends the following message to your screen:

                         !
                         ! End of DEC DATATRIEVE/Forms User Environment Test Package

                         the DEC DATATRIEVE CBT installed, the CBT can
                         remain. This new kit will add to or overwrite
                         the existing CBTs as appropriate.

                      2  Pre-installation of the DEC DATATRIEVE CBT

                         Perform the following steps before running the
                         VMSINSTAL procedure:

                         - Copy the new kit from the tape containing
                           the savesets, DTC010.A and DTC010.B.

                         - Set your process privileges to ALL.

                           SET PROC/PRIV=ALL

                         - Check to see if the DEC DATATRIEVE CBT has
                           been previously installed:

                           SHOW LOGICAL EASY$MANAGER

                           If the logical exists, the DEC DATATRIEVE
                           CBT has been installed before. Invoke
                           shutdown command for each node in the
                           cluster:

                           @SYS$MANAGER:EASY$SHUTDOWN.COM

                                                                     6-1

 





                      DEC DATATRIEVE CBT Installation (VAX Only)




                           Next, invoke the startup command for the
                           node on which you are installing:

                           @SYS$MANAGER:EASY$STARTUP.COM

                           If you find that the DEC DATATRIEVE
                           CBT has been previously installed, go
                           on to Step 3, SITE WITH A PREVIOUS
                           EASYAUTHOR INSTALLATION, and do the actual
                           installation.

                         - Find a UIC (if EasyAuthor CBTs not
                           previously installed on system).

                           Find an available UIC to become the owner
                           of the files to be installed. A new account
                           name (EASYMGR) is created during install.
                           This account has the DISUSER flag set.

                         - Find a disk to use (if this is the first
                           time you install on the system).

                           The installation will require approximately
                           12,000 blocks.

                      3  Installation of the DEC DATATRIEVE CBT

                         Perform the install by running VMSINSTAL. The
                         following is a log file of the installation.
                         Notations (<<-) are included to show where
                         entry is required. These notations will not
                         appear on the screen during the install.

                         Before any of the system's users can access
                         this CBT, the EASY and LOADDRAW symbols must
                         be added to SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM or user's
                         LOGIN.COM as follows:

                         EASY :== $EASY$PROGRAM:SOLORTP.EXE
                         LOADDRAW :== $EASY$PROGRAM:LOADDRAW.EXE

                         Upon completion of the above steps, the DEC
                         DATATRIEVE CBT is installed on a single node.
                         To test the installation, run it from a user
                         account by typing:

                         EASY

                         Edit the main course menu file to remove
                         duplicate lines (if the course has been
                         previously installed). The file is
                         EASY$PROGRAM:EASY.CAT.

                      5  Start-up in clustered systems

                         To enable the lessons on all nodes in the
                         cluster, run the EASY$STARTUP command on EACH
                         NODE as follows:

                         @SYS$MANAGER:EASY$STARTUP.COM

                      6  De-installation of the DEC DATATRIEVE CBT (if
                         ever necessary)

                         A shutdown command file can be found in
                         SYS$MANAGER. The name of the file is
                         EASY$SHUTDOWN.COM. This command file removes
                         all logicals, logical name tables, and shared
                         images associated with this package.

                      To completely remove this package from the
                      system:

                      o  Examine the EASY$LESSONS logical. This logical
                         will tell you where the CBT has been installed.

                      o  Execute the command file (for all nodes if
                         clustered),

                         @SYS$MANAGER:EASY$SHUTDOWN

                      o  Remove the entire [EASYMGR] directory tree.

                            VAXLSE is installed on your system.

                            You now have the following options:

                      1.   Do a complete DEC DATATRIEVE installation including
                           DEC DATATRIEVE support for LSE.

                      2.   Do only DEC DATATRIEVE support for LSE without
                           installing DEC DATATRIEVE.

                      3.   Do a DEC DATATRIEVE installation without including
                           DEC DATATRIEVE support for LSE.

                      * Select option [1]: 3

                      The following Forms Management products have been found on

                             FMS  (Forms Management System)

                      DEC DATATRIEVE can be built to support any one of these
                      products, or, if desired, DEC DATATRIEVE can be built without
                      support of any of these Forms Management products

                      * Do you want DEC DATATRIEVE to support one of these products
                      [YES]? NO

                      It is possible to do more than one installation of DEC DATATRIEVE.
                      More than one installation of a single version may be desirable
                      for a number of reasons including:

                         o Use of multiple forms management products (such as
                         FMS and TDMS; DECforms is available in every image,
                         if present on the system)

                         o Use of multiple foreign language translations of DEC
                         DATATRIEVE (such as French or German)

                      * Do you plan to install this version more than once [NO]?
                      * Do you want DTRSHR.EXE and DTRMSGS.EXE to be installed SHARED
                      [YES]?
                      * Do you want DTR32.EXE to be installed SHARED [YES]?

                         Some optional material is available with this kit including
                         the components of DEC DATATRIEVE that can be tailored at
                         the installed site.

                      Before invoking these files from a user's account you must
                      execute the procedure :
                                             @DTR$LIBRARY:NEWUSER.COM
                      This procedure loads the DEC DATATRIEVE definitions into the
                      user's dictionary and the data files in the user's directory.
                      This procedure must be executed by each user needing
                      the DEC DATATRIEVE examples
