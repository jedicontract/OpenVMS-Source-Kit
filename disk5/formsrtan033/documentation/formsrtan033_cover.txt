          This kit installation will perform a complete replacement of all
          existing DECforms components.

          To install V3.3 invoke the VMSINSTALL command procedure, as
          described in the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual, and follow
          the instructions in the DECforms Installation Guide for OpenVMS
          Systems.

                                        NOTE

             During installation of the V3.3 Asian kit, the release
             date displays as 2000 rather than 2003. This has no effect
             on the installation.
