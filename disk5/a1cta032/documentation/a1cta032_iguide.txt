        1.1 Installation Types

              The following types of installation are supported in this
              release.

              o  Full installation of ALL-IN-1/Hanyu Version 3.2 on a
                 VAX or an Alpha System.

              o  Upgrade installation of ALL-IN-1/Hanyu Version 3.0 or
                 Version 3.0a to ALL-IN-1/Hanyu Version 3.2 on a VAX.

              o  Upgrade installation of standard ALL-IN-1 Version 3.1
                 to ALL-IN-1/Hanyu Version 3.2 on a VAX or an Alpha
                 System.

              o  Addition of VAX or Alpha architecture support for
                 ALL-IN-1/Hanyu Version 3.2 on a different architeture
                 in the same VMXcluster.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                You can only upgrade to ALL-IN-1/Hanyu V3.2 using
                the same default language as that on your current
                system. This means that if your current system is
                running ALL-IN-1 V3.1, the default language would
                be English. In this case, you must install ALL-IN-1
                /Hanyu V3.2 using English as the main installation
                language (the default language). Hanyu will be
                installed as an additional language.

              You must register your ALLIN1-UI-HANYU Version 3.2
              license before you perform the installation. During the
              installation, you are asked if you have registered and
              loaded the ALLIN1-UI-HANYU Version 3.2 license.

              The ALL-IN-1/Hanyu Version 3.2 installation checks for
              a registered license when it begins. If a license is not
              found, the installation terminates.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                You cannot use the Register Licenses for Prerequisite
                Products (RL) option offered at the beginning of the
                installation procedure, unless you have a valid
                ALLIN1-UI-HANYU license registered.

                _____________________________________________________

              For complete information on using LMF, see the manual on
              the License Management Utility in the VMS documentation

        1.6 Installing Additional Languages

              ALL-IN-1/Hanyu V3.2 kit is supplied with the Hanyu and
              English language components. You can install either one or
              both.

              If it is a new installation, you can install the languages
              in any order. The language that you install when the main
              ALL-IN-1/Hanyu V3.2 kit is installed becomes the default
              language of your system.

              If you are upgrading/updating to ALL-IN-1/Hanyu V3.2, you
              can only upgrade/update using the same default language as
              that on your current system.

                                 Preparing to Install Hanyu FMS Software



              This chapter discusses the preparations and requirements
              necessary to install Hanyu FMS software.

              Hanyu FMS provides online release notes. You can read and
              print the release notes before the Hanyu FMS installation
              begins, when you first run the installation procedure.
              Digital Equipment Corporation strongly recommends that
              you read the release notes before proceeding with the
              installation.

        7.1 Prerequisite and Optional Software

              This section discusses the software you must have
              installed on your system before installing Hanyu FMS
              software. The section also includes information about
              software that you can use together with Hanyu FMS
              software.

              DEC FMS/Hanyu Version 2.4 requires OpenVMS/Hanyu for Alpha
              Version 6.1 operating system.

              If the optional software uses CDD/Plus software, or if
              DBMS software is to be part of the system, you should
              install those products before you install Hanyu FMS.
              CDDSHR.EXE must always be installed using the Install
              Utility.

        7.2 Prerequisite Hardware

              To run the IVP, you must have a video terminal. See

        7.3 License Registration

        7.3 License Registration

              The VMS License Management Facility (LMF) is available
              with OpenVMS/Hanyu Alpha Version 6.1 operating system. If
              you are installing Hanyu FMS on a OpenVMS/Hanyu Alpha
              Version 6.1 system, you must register your software
              license. [1]

              The license registration information you need is contained
              in the Product Authorization Key (PAK) that is shipped
              with ALL-IN-1/Hanyu. The PAK is a paper certificate that
              contains information about the license you own to run a
              particular piece of software.

              During the installation, you are asked if you have
              registered the required ALL-IN-1 license, namely ALLIN1-
              UI-HANYU. You must register and load this license for
              Hanyu FMS before you start the installation in order to
              run the IVP and use the software.

        7.4 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The following sections discuss various requirements for
              installing Hanyu FMS software.

        7.4.1 Restrictions

              No users should be logged in to the system while you
              are installing Hanyu FMS software. You can use the REPLY
              command to send a message to users. For example:

              $ REPLY/ALL "Please log off now. Installing CFMS."

              If VMSINSTAL detects any users on the system, it gives
              you an opportunity to stop the installation procedure by
              prompting you to continue. To stop the installation, press
              RETURN.

              ___________________
              [1]Hanyu FMS software can be installed without regis-
                 tering the CFMS license.  However, the IVP is not
                 executed without a license registration.  In addition,
                 the CFMS utilities and applications using the Form
                 Driver are not run until a license is properly

                 registered.

              the description of the Authorize Utility in the VMS
              documentation set.

        7.4.7 VMSINSTAL Requirements

              When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks whether:

              o  You have set your default device and directory to
                 SYS$UPDATE

              o  You are logged in to a privileged account

              o  You have adequate process account quotas for installa-
                 tion

              o  DECnet software is up and running

              o  Any users are logged in to the system

              VMSINSTAL requires that the installation account have a
              minimum of quotas as tabulated in Table 7-3.

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks if you want to continue the
              installation. In some instances, you can enter YES
              to continue. To stop the installation and correct the
              situation, enter NO or press RETURN. Correct the problem

                                           Installing Hanyu FMS Software



              This chapter describes how to install Hanyu FMS software.
              Section 8.2 contains a step-by-step description of the
              installation procedure.

        8.1 General Information

              This section includes information about accessing release
              notes, determining what files and logical names are added
              to your system, running the Installation Verification
              Procedure (IVP), and ending the installation abnormally.

        8.1.1 Accessing the Online Release Notes

              Hanyu FMS provides online release notes. You should review
              the release notes in case they contain any information
              about changes in the installation procedure.

              If you want the installation procedure to give you an
              opportunity to display or print the online release notes,
              you must specify OPTIONS N when you invoke VMSINSTAL. This
              question comes near the beginning of the installation.

              Once Hanyu FMS has been installed, the release notes are
              located in the following file:

              SYS$HELP:DECFMS024.RELEASE_NOTES

              Online help also directs you to the release notes file.
              After the installation, you can enter the following
              command to review the release notes through the Help
              Facility:

              $ HELP CFMS RELEASE_NOTES

        Installing Hanyu FMS Software
        8.1 General Information

        8.1.2 Determining the Files and Logical Names Added to the
              System

              Appendix A and Appendix B of the online release notes list
              the files added, replaced, or modified on your system when
              Hanyu FMS is installed.

              Hanyu FMS adds only one logical name CFMS$EXAMPLES to
              the system when it is installed. Appendix A as well as
              Appendix A of the online release notes list the files
              associated with CFMS$EXAMPLES.

        8.1.3 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              The IVP for Hanyu FMS verifies the installation. During
              the installation, you are asked if you want to run the IVP
              as part of the installation. If you respond YES, VMSINSTAL
              runs the IVP. It is recommended that you run the IVP to be
              sure that Hanyu FMS is installed correctly.

              After Hanyu FMS is installed, you can run the IVP
              independently to verify that the software is available
              on your system. You might also want to run the IVP after a
              system failure to be sure that users can access Hanyu FMS.

              Because of their interactive nature, the Form Editor and
              the Form Tester must be tested manually on a VT382 Hanyu-
              compatible terminal. To verify the installation of the
              Form Editor and Form Tester, see the procedure explained
              in Chapter Chapter 10.

        8.1.4 Ending the Installation Abnormally

              To end the installation procedure abnormally at any time,
              press CTRL/Y. When you press CTRL/Y, the installation
              procedure deletes all files it has created and exits. You
              then can start the installation again.

        8.2 Installation Procedure

              The Hanyu FMS installation procedure consists of a series
              of questions, prompts, and informational messages. The
              following sections explain how to invoke VMSINSTAL and
              answer the installation questions. These sections also
              explain the informational messages displayed by the
              procedure.

                                              8.2 Installation Procedure

        8.2.1 Invoking VMSINSTAL

              To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command
              procedure from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM
              account. VMSINSTAL is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. To
              invoke VMSINSTAL, enter a command with the following
              syntax:

              @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL product-name device-name OPTIONS N

              product-name
              The installation name for the product. For Hanyu FMS
              software, use the following installation name:

              CFMS024

              device-name
              The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
              media. For example, DKA400: is the device name for a CD-
              ROM drive. It is not necessary to use the console drive
              for this installation. However, if you do use the console
              drive, you should replace any media you have removed once
              the installation is complete.

              OPTIONS N
              An optional parameter that indicates you want to see the
              question on the release notes. If you do not include the
              OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about the
              release notes.

              There are several other options you can select when you
              invoke VMSINSTAL. For information on these options, see
              the VMS documentation on software installation

              The following example displays the command that invokes
              VMSINSTAL to install Hanyu FMS from CD-ROM drive DKA400:
              and shows the system response. This example uses the
              OPTIONS N parameter.

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL CFMS024 DKA400: OPTIONS N

              It is 14-NOV-1995 at 10:15.
              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              If you omit either the product name or the device name,
              VMSINSTAL asks you for this information later.

                                              8.2 Installation Procedure

              1. Shut down DECnet.

                 %VMSINSTAL-W-DECNET, Your DECnet network is up and running.
                    .
                    .
                    .
                 * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

                 You should install Hanyu FMS on a standalone system or
                 cluster with DECnet shut down. VMSINSTAL notifies you
                 if DECnet is running and displays a list of all active
                 processes. The procedure then asks if you want to
                 continue the installation. NO is the default response
                 to the question.

              2. Confirm system backup.

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                 VMSINSTAL asks if you are satisfied with your system
                 backup. You should always back up your system disk
                 before performing an installation. If you are satisfied
                 with the backup of your system disk, press RETURN.
                 Otherwise, enter NO to stop the installation. After
                 you back up your system disk, you can restart the
                 installation.

              3. Mount the media.

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on DKA400:.
                 * Are you ready? YES
                 %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, DECCFMS MOUNTED ON _$$DKA400:
                 The following products will be processed:

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

                 You should now mount the first distribution volume on
                 the device you specified when you invoked VMSINSTAL.
                 The device name appears in the line preceding the
                 question "Are you ready?". VMSINSTAL then asks you
                 if you are ready to continue with the installation.

                 If you respond YES to indicate that you are ready,
                 VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing
                 Hanyu FMS has been mounted on the specified device and
                 that the installation has begun.

                  2.  Print release notes
                  3.  Both 1 and 2
                  4.  Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
                  5.  Do not display, print or copy release notes

                 * Select option [2]:

                 If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL,
                 you have five options for reviewing the release notes.

                 If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes immediately on your terminal. To terminate the
                 display at any time, press CTRL/C.

                 If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL asks you for the name
                 of the print queue that you want to use:

                 * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                 You can press RETURN to print the release notes on the
                 default output print device or you can enter another
                 queue name. Option 2 is the default.

                 If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes immediately on the terminal and then asks you for
                 a queue name for the printed version.

                 If you select option 4, the installation copies the
                 release notes to the Help directory. Even if you do not
                 select option 4, the release notes for Hanyu FMS are
                 copied to the SYS$HELP directory.

                 Select option 5 if you have already reviewed the
                 release notes.

        Installing Hanyu FMS Software
        8.2 Installation Procedure

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The name of the release notes file installed by
                VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name and
                version number. Do not delete release notes for
                previous versions of Hanyu FMS software.

                _____________________________________________________

              6. Register your license.

                 This is a special FMS/Hanyu kit which comes with ALL-IN-1/Hanyu kit and
                 requires ALLIN1-UI-HANYU license to operate.

                 Product:       ALLIN1-UI-HANYU
                 Producer:      DEC
                 Version:       3.2
                 Release Date:  17-OCT-1995

                 * Does this product have an authorization key registered
                 and loaded?

                 As FMS/Hanyu V2.4 is not a released product, the
                 installation procedure displays license information
                 about ALL-IN-1/Hanyu and then asks if you have
                 registered and loaded the authorization key.

                 If you have not registered and loaded your authoriza-
                 tion key, you must answer NO to this question. You
                 have to register and load your product authorization
                 key to complete the installation. If you have not done
                 so, you should stop the installation, register and
                 load your product authorization key, and restart the
                 installation.

              7. Run the IVP.

                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation
                 [YES]?

                 The installation procedure now asks if you want to
                 run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP). The
                 IVP for Hanyu FMS software checks to be sure that the
                 installation is successful. It is recommended that you
                 run the IVP.

                                           Installing Hanyu FMS Software
                                              8.2 Installation Procedure

              8. Purge files.

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation
                 dir[YES]?

                 You have the option to purge files from previous ver-
                 sions of Hanyu FMS that this installation supercedes.
                 Purging is recommended; however, to save files from the
                 previous version, enter NO in response to the question.

              9. Choose installation options.

                 * Do you wish to install Sample Application Programs and
                 Modifiable Message File Procedures [YES]?

                 You are now asked to choose your installation options.
                 If you answer YES to the prompt, the Hanyu FMS
                 modifiable message files and sample applications
                 are installed. The files relating to the sample
                 applications are found in the CFMS$EXAMPLES: directory.
                 The Hanyu FMS installation and start-up procedure
                 (SYS$STARTUP:CFMSTARTUP.COM) defines a system logical
                 for the CFMS$EXAMPLES: directory.

                 The Modifiable Message File Procedures create a
                 subdirectory containing the sources for the CFMS
                 Message Files and instructions on how to modify the
                 text of the messages in the CFMS Form Driver and CFMS
                 Utilities. The message files are found in the subdirec-
                 tory SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.CFMS.MESSAGE]. The
                 instructions for modifying the message files are in the
                 CFMS_MESSAGE.MEM file in that subdirectory.

        8.2.3 Informational Messages

              The installation procedure displays a number of infor-
              mational messages that report on the progress of the
              installation. There are no further questions. If the
              installation has been successful, VMSINSTAL moves the new
              or modified files to their target directories, updates
              help files, and updates DCL tables, if necessary. If
              you asked for files to be purged, that is done now. The
              procedure displays the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target
              directories...

        8.2 Installation Procedure

              If the installation procedure is successful, the following
              files are moved to their target directory:

              o  SYS$SYSTEM:CFMSFAA.EXE

              o  SYS$SYSTEM:CFMSFED.EXE

              o  SYS$SYSTEM:CFMSFLG.EXE

              o  SYS$SYSTEM:CFMSFLI.EXE

              o  SYS$SYSTEM:CFMSFTE.EXE

              o  SYS$SYSTEM:CFMSFUU.EXE

              In addition, the SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              files are updated to include the new version of the
              Hanyu FMS HELP text and the CFMS command line definition,
              respectively. The Hanyu FMS release notes are copied to
              the SYS$HELP:DECFMS024.RELEASE_NOTES file.

              For a complete list of files that have been created or
              modified by the installation procedure, see Appendix
              Appendix B.

        8.2.4 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              If you have chosen to run the IVP, VMSINSTAL runs it now.
              The procedure displays the following message:

              Beginning CFMS V2.4 Installation Verification Procedure...

              If Hanyu FMS has been installed, the IVP displays the
              following message:

              CFMS V2.4 Installation Verification Procedure was successful
              Refer to the Hanyu FMS Installation Guide for further
              verification procedures..

              You can run the IVP separately any time after Hanyu FMS
              software has been installed. To run the IVP, enter the
              following command:

              @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS$TEST.CFMS]CFMS$IVP

        8.2.5 Completing the Installation Procedure

              The following messages indicate that the installation is
              complete:

              Installation of CFMS V2.4 completed at 11:03

              VMSINSTAL procedure done at 11:17

              You can now log out of the privileged account as follows:

              $ LOGOUT

              The following message is displayed:

              SYSTEM     logged out at 14-NOV-1995 11:24:32.40

              VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process symbol
              tables during the installation. Therefore, to continue
              using the system manager's account and to restore these
              symbols, log out and log in again.

        8.3 Error Recovery

              If errors occur during the installation itself or when
              the IVP is running, VMSINSTAL displays failure messages.
              If the installation fails, the procedure displays the
              following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of CFMS V2.4 has
              failed.

              If the IVP fails, the procedure displays the following
              messages:

              The CFMS V2.4 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for CFMS V2.4 has failed.

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exists:

              o  The version of the operating system is incorrect.

              o  Quotas are insufficient.

                                                                       9
        ________________________________________________________________

                                     After Installing Hanyu FMS Software



              After installing Hanyu FMS software, you need to perform
              the following tasks:

              o  Edit the system startup files.

              o  Set user account quotas.

        9.1 Editing the System Files

              To provide for automatic startup of Hanyu FMS when your
              system is restarted, you must edit two system files. To
              edit these startup files, use the following procedure:

              1. Add the command line that starts Hanyu FMS to the
                 system startup file, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.
                 Hanyu FMS software cannot start until the network has
                 started. You must put this new command line after the
                 network startup command line. The following example
                 shows the network startup command line followed by the
                 startup command line for Hanyu FMS:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
                      .
                      .
                      .
                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:CFMSTARTUP.COM

              2. The CFMS start-up command procedure contains several
                 VMS commands. The first command assigns the logical
                 name CFMS$EXAMPLES to the directory that contains the
                 sample application programs for DEC FMS/Hanyu Version
                 2.4.

        After Installing Hanyu FMS Software
        9.1 Editing the System Files

                 The last commands in the command procedure install
                 CFDVSHR and CFDVMSG as known shared images. To improve
                 the performance of CFMS application programs, you can
                 remove the following line from CFMSTARTUP.COM:

                 $ EXIT         ! Remove this line to install the images

                 If you have made any changes to the CFMSTARTUP.COM
                 file, use the SHUTDOWN procedure to stop the current
                 system, and restart the system.

        9.2 User Account Requirements

              To work with Hanyu FMS, user accounts on your system must
              have at least the TMPMBX privilege. The accounts must also
              have the quotas shown in Table 9-1.

              Table_9-1_User_Account_Quotas_for_Using_CFMS_Software_____

              Account_Quota_________Value_______________________________

              ENQLM                 30

              FILLM_________________20__________________________________

              User account privileges and quotas are stored in the file
              SYSUAF.DAT. To verify and change user account quotas,
              use the VMS Authorize Utility. For more information
              on modifying account privileges and quotas, see the
              description of the Authorize Utility in the System
              Management Utilities Reference Manaul

        9.3 Running the IVP

              When CFMS is installed, the IVP is automatically placed in
              the following location: SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS$TEST.CFMS]CFMS$IVP.COM.
              The IVP is placed there even if you have chosen not to run
              it at installation time.

                                                     9.3 Running the IVP

              You can run the IVP at any time after CFMS has been
              installed by entering the following command:

              @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS$TEST.CFMS]CFMS$IVP

        9.4 Special Requirements

              To prevent data loss, users should set their terminals to
              HOSTSYNC and TYPAHEAD before using Hanyu FMS software. For
              more information, see the online release notes.

        9.5 Enhancing Hanyu FMS Performance

              This section includes information on system tuning and
              explains how to install Hanyu FMS as a shared image.

              The Form Driver for DEC FMS/Hanyu Version 2.4 is built
              as a shared image. If several users who run Hanyu FMS
              applications at the same time are on your system, each
              user has a copy of the Form Driver in memory. If you
              install the Form Driver as a known shared image, the
              users share a single copy of the Form Driver in memory
              when Hanyu FMS applications are run.

              A known shared image reduces memory requirements and can
              improve system performance.

              To install Hanyu FMS as a known shared image on a system
              that is currently running, use the VMS Install Utility
              (INSTALL). It is recommended that you perform the install
              operation on a system that has just been started because
              the available space in the global page table is less
              likely to be fragmented.

              To install Hanyu FMS as a shared image, use the following
              procedure:

              1. Determine the number of available global pagelets
                 and global sections on your system. Refer to System
                 Manager's Manual for information on how to verify
                 and modify the number of global pagelets and global
                 sections. Table 7-3 contains the required values for
                 these parameters.

              2. Once you have reset the system parameter values, invoke
                 the VMS Install Utility from a privileged account and
                 install Hanyu FMS as a shared image, as follows:

                 $ INSTALL
                 INSTALL> ADD SYS$SHARE:CFDVSHR.EXE /OPEN /SHARED
                 INSTALL> ADD SYS$MESSAGE:CFDVMSG.EXE /OPEN /SHARED
                 INSTALL> ADD SYS$MESSAGE:CFDVMSGE.EXE /OPEN /SHARED
                 INSTALL> EXIT

              3. Add the following lines to the appropriate system
                 startup command file so that each time the system
                 is started, Hanyu FMS software is available as a
                 shared image. (If your site has modularized its
                 startup procedures, be sure you add the lines to
                 the correct file. The default startup command
                 file for VMS Alpha Version 6.1 operating system is
                 SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.)

                 $RUN SYS$SYSTEM:INSTALL
                 SYS$SHARE:CFDVSHR /OPEN /SHARED
                 SYS$MESSAGE:CFDVMSG /OPEN /SHARED
                 SYS$MESSAGE:CFDVMSGE /OPEN /SHARED

              4. When you install Hanyu FMS as a shared image, you need
                 to increase the global pagelets (GBLPAGES) by 250 and
                 global sections (GBLSECTIONS) by 4. Refer to System
                 Manager's Manual for information on changing these
                 parameters.

        9.6 Determining and Reporting Problems

              If an error occurs while Hanyu FMS is being used and you
              believe that the error is caused by a problem with Hanyu
              FMS, call your Customer Support Center.

                               Verifying the Form Editor and Form Tester



              Because of their interactive nature, the Form Editor and
              the Form Tester must be tested manually on a VT382 Hanyu-
              compatible terminal. The following procedure verifies the
              installation of the Form Editor and the Form Tester.

              1. Log in using a VT382 Hanyu-compatible terminal.

              2. Enter the SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE command to request a
                 response sequence from your terminal, as follows:

                 $  SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE

              3. Create a form to test the Form Editor.

                 To create a form, specify the name of a file that does
                 not exist in the current directory. (In this example,
                 the file is called testfile.frm.) The default file type
                 is .FRM. For example:

                 $  CFMS/EDIT testfile.frm

              4. Select a Form Editor Menu option.

                 After you have entered the Form Editor, select LAYOUT
                 at the Phase Choice prompt. The screen is cleared and
                 the Layout Phase status line appears at the bottom of
                 your screen.

                 Phase Choice: LAYOUT

              5. Enter text into your form. For example:

                 This is a test of CFMS.

                 To enter field mode, press the PF1 key and then the
                 keypad 8 key. Type the letter x six times to indicate a
                 field. For example:

                 <PF1> <KP8>
                 XXXXXX

                          Verifying the Form Editor and Form Tester 10-1

 



        Verifying the Form Editor and Form Tester


              6. Exit the Form Editor.

                 Press the PF1 key and the keypad 7 key to exit the
                 Layout Phase of the Form Editor. The Form Editor Menu
                 reappears; at the prompt, type EXIT and press RETURN.

                 <PF1> <KP7>
                 Phase Choice: EXIT

              7. Save the form.

                 After you have exited Layout Phase, the Editor prompts
                 you to save the file. Press RETURN to save the form.

                 $ Do you want to save this form?
                  %FMS-I-FORMSAVED, Form testfile.frm saved in testfile.frm

              8. Test the form, as follows:

                 $ CFMS/TEST testfile.frm

                 Hanyu FMS displays your form. Type any 4 Hanyu
                 characters. The fourth character does not echo on the
                 screen. The terminal bell rings and an error message
                 indicating that the field is full is displayed at
                 the bottom of your terminal screen. Press RETURN. The
                 system prompt is displayed.

                 123456
                 <RETURN>
                 $

              9. Delete the form file, as follows:

                 $ DELETE testfile.frm;*

                 The test is complete. If any errors have occurred
                 during the test, follow the instructions in Section
                 8.3.

              This appendix contains sample installations of Hanyu FMS
              software. These samples have been run on a system that has
              no previous version of Hanyu FMS installed.

              The sample installation assumes that DECnet has been shut
              down, that no users are logged in to your system, and that
              OPTIONS N is specified to print the release notes. The
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs at the end
              of the installation.
