              Your bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report
              (BIL) specify the number of media in your kit and the
              contents of your kit. Make sure you compare your kit with
              this information. If your kit is damaged or incomplete,
              contact your Compaq representative.

              DECforms provides online release notes. You can read or
              print the release notes before you begin the DECforms
              installation.

                ___________________ Recommendation ___________________

                Compaq Computer Corporation strongly recommends that
                you read the release notes before you proceed with the
                installation. For more information about the release
                notes that ship with your kit, see Section 2.1.

                ______________________________________________________

        1.1 Required Operating System Components

              To install DECforms, you must have certain operating system
              components. The components you need depend on whether you
              are installing the DECforms full development kit or the
              run-time kit.

              The DECforms full development kit contains the DECforms
              run-time system and development utilities. To install this
              kit, you must have installed the following OpenVMS classes:

              o  OpenVMS required save set

              o  Programming support (for STARLET.OLB and IMAGELIB.OLB)

              o  Utilities (for HELPLIB.OLB)

                               Preparing to Install DECforms Software 1-1

 







          The DECforms run-time kit contains only the DECforms run-
          time system. To install the DECforms run-time kit, you must
          have installed the OpenVMS required save set class.

    1.2 Required and Optional Software

          This section discusses the software that must already be
          installed on your system before installing DECforms. The
          section also includes information about optional software
          that you can use with DECforms.

          To install DECforms, you must have installed on your
          system:

          o  A valid OpenVMS operating system configuration, OpenVMS
             Version 6.2 or higher

          o  Oracle CDD/Repository Version 5.3 or higher, if you
             intend to store definitions in Oracle CDD/Repository
             software

          o  DEC LSE Version 2.3 or higher if you intend to use
             the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor (DEC LSE) templates
             for the DECforms Independent Form Description Language
             (IFDL)

          o  DECwindows Motif Version 1.1 or higher if you intend to
             use DECwindows Motif support in DECforms

          If you are going to use the Compaq DECforms Web Connector
          on your OpenVMS system, you must also have installed on
          your system:

          o  Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS, Version 4.1 plus ECO
             8
             or Version 4.2 or higher

          o  RPC run-time component from Compaq Distributed Computing
             Environment (DCE) for OpenVMS Version 1.4 or higher

          For a complete list of the products that are compatible
          with this version of DECforms, see the Software Product
          Description.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

        1.3 Required Hardware

              DECforms supports Compaq VT100-, VT200-, VT300-, VT400-,
              VT500-series terminals, DECwindows Motif VAX workstations,
              and PCs that use the Windows NT operating system.

        1.4 License Registration

              You must register the DECforms software license with the
              OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF). The LMF is
              available with Version 5.0 of the OpenVMS operating system.

              The Product Authorization Key (PAK) that is shipped with
              DECforms contains the license registration information
              you need. The PAK is a paper certificate that contains
              information about the license you have purchased to run a
              particular piece of software.

              During the installation, you are asked whether you have
              registered the DECforms license and loaded the appropriate
              authorization keys. It is therefore best to register your
              DECforms license before you do the installation.

              If you have not registered the DECforms license and loaded
              the appropriate authorization keys, you can complete the
              installation; however, you cannot run either the DECforms
              software or its Installation Verification Procedure (IVP).
              Once you register the license and load an authorization
              key, you can run the IVP and use DECforms.

              To register a license under Version 5.5 or higher of the
              OpenVMS operating system, log in to the system manager's
              account, SYSTEM. You then can register a license in one of
              the following ways:

              o  Run the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When the
                 procedure prompts you for information, enter data from
                 your PAK.

              o  Enter the LICENSE REGISTER command with the appropriate
                 qualifiers that correspond to information on the PAK.

              If you are installing DECforms on an OpenVMS Cluster
              system, you must register your license on each licensed
              node in the OpenVMS Cluster system.

                               Preparing to Install DECforms Software 1-3

 







          For complete information on using LMF, see the section in
          the OpenVMS documentation set on the License Management
          Facility.

    1.5 Installation Requirements

          The following sections discuss various requirements for
          installing DECforms.

    1.5.1 Time

          Installing DECforms and running the IVP requires
          approximately 5 to 35 minutes, depending on your system
          configuration and the distribution media you are using.

    1.5.2 Privileges

          To install DECforms, you must be logged into an account

        1.5.4 System Parameters

              Installing DECforms requires certain system parameter
              settings, as shown in Table 1-2.

              The numbers shown in Table 1-2 represent the required
              number of unused global pages and global sections on your
              system for the DECforms installation to process. If your
              system has less than the required number, you must increase
              these values to the amount indicated.

                               Preparing to Install DECforms Software 1-5

 







          To find the number of unused global pages and global
          sections, use the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical
          function, as shown in the following example:

          $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")
          3420
          $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")
          24

          If the value of free global pages or global sections is
          less than the value in Table 1-2, you must increase the
          system parameter setting.

          Changing System Parameters

          Use the AUTOGEN command procedure to change system
          parameters. AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for
          parameters that are associated with the values that you
          reset manually.

          To change system parameters with AUTOGEN, use the following
          procedure:

          1. Edit the SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file.

             To change a parameter value listed in this file, delete
             the current value associated with that parameter and
             enter the new value.

             To add a new parameter, add a line to the file that
             includes both the name of the parameter and its value.
             For example:

             WSMAX = 1024

             To modify incremental parameters such as GBLPAGES and
             GBLSECTIONS, use ADD_. For example, the following line
             increases the global page setting by 2000:

             ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000

             When you set the page file quota, do not use a value
             that exceeds the amount of page file space available on
             the system.

          2. Execute the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
             parameters. After you have made all your changes, exit
             the editor and then enter the following command at the
             DCL prompt:

             $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

    1-6 Preparing to Install DECforms Software

 







                 When you specify REBOOT, AUTOGEN performs an automatic
                 system shutdown and then restarts the system. Any users
                 logged on to the system are immediately disconnected
                 during the shutdown. The automatic restart puts the new
                 parameter values into effect.

                 AUTOGEN automatically adjusts some of the SYSGEN
                 parameters based on the consumption of resources since
                 the last restart. If you do not want to take advantage
                 of this automatic adjustment, include the NOFEEDBACK
                 qualifier on the AUTOGEN command line.

              For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the OpenVMS
              System Management Subkit.

        1.5.5 VMSINSTAL Requirements

              When you run VMSINSTAL, it checks whether:

              o  You are logged in to a privileged account.

              o  You have adequate quotas for installation.

              o  DECnet is up and running.

              o  Any users are logged in to the system.

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks whether you want to continue
              the installation. In some instances, you can enter YES
              to continue. To stop the installation and correct the
              situation, enter NO or press Return. Correct the problem
              and restart the installation.

              For more information about VMSINSTAL, see the Compaq
              OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference Manual.

        1.5.6 Backing Up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks
              whether you have backed up your system disk. Compaq
              recommends that you back up your system disk before
              installing any software.

              Use the backup procedures that have been established at
              your site. For details on backing up your disk, see the
              section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS documentation
              set.

                                             Installing DECforms Software


              This chapter describes how to install Compaq DECforms
              software. Section 2.5 contains a step-by-step description
              of the installation procedure.

        2.1 Accessing the Online Release Notes

              You should review the Release Notes that DECforms provides;
              they might contain information about changes in the
              installation procedures. If you specify OPTIONS N when
              you run VMSINSTAL, the installation procedure asks you
              whether you want to display or print the release notes.
              Compaq recommends that you print the release notes.

              After you install DECforms, you can find the OpenVMS Alpha
              release notes located in SYS$HELP:FORMSA031.RELEASE_NOTES.

              The release notes for OpenVMS VAX are located in
              SYS$HELP:FORMS031.RELEASE_NOTES.

        2.2 Determining the Files and Logical Names Added to the System

              The DECforms installation procedure adds a number of files
              to your system. It also modifies some files and defines
              some logical names. Appendix C lists the changes that the
              DECforms installation procedure makes to your system.

        2.3 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              The IVP for DECforms verifies the installation. DECforms
              provides two IVPs, one for the full development kit and one
              for the run-time kit.

              When you are installing the DECforms kit, the installation
              procedure asks whether you want to run the IVP as part of
              the installation. If you respond YES, VMSINSTAL runs the
              appropriate IVP. You should run the IVP to verify that
              DECforms is installed correctly.

                                         Installing DECforms Software 2-1

 







          Should you need to run the IVP at any time after
          installation, enter the following command on a VT100-,
          VT200-, VT300-, VT400-, or VT500-series terminal or on a
          corresponding workstation terminal emulator:

          Run-Time Kit IVP

          $ @SYS$TEST:FORMS$RT_IVP.COM

          Full Development Kit IVP

          $ @SYS$TEST:FORMS$IVP.COM

    2.4 Aborting the Installation

          To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
          Ctrl/Y. The installation procedure deletes all files that
          it has created and exits. You can start the installation
          again.

    2.5 Running the Installation Procedure

          The DECforms installation procedure consists of a series
          of questions and informational messages. The following
          sections explain how to run the VMSINSTAL procedure
          and answer the installation questions. These sections
          also explain the informational messages displayed by the
          procedure.

    2.5.1 Running VMSINSTAL

          To start the installation, run the VMSINSTAL command
          procedure from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM
          account. VMSINSTAL is in the SYS$UPDATE directory.

          To set default to the SYS$UPDATE directory, enter the
          following command:

          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE

          To run VMSINSTAL, enter a command with the following
          syntax:

          @VMSINSTAL [product-name device-name options-list]

          If you omit the parameters from the command line, VMSINSTAL
          asks you for this information later.

          The following list defines the elements of the VMSINSTAL
          procedure.

    2-2 Installing DECforms Software

 







              product-name
              The installation name for the product. For the DECforms
              full development kit running on Alpha, use the installation
              name FORMSA031. For the DECforms full development kit
              running on VAX, use the installation name FORMS031.

              For the DECforms run-time kit running on Alpha, use the
              installation name FORMSRTA031. For the DECforms run-time
              kit running on VAX, use the installation name FORMSRT031.

              device-name
              The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
              media or the directory where you copied the savesets.
              For example, MTA0: is the device name for a tape drive;
              DKA0:[MYDIRECTORY] the name for a disk drive. You do not
              need to use the console drive for this installation. If
              you do use the console drive, once the installation is
              complete, you should replace any media you removed.

              options-list
              The word OPTIONS followed by one or more of the available
              options designators, including the following:

              o  Display or print release notes (N)

                 Indicates you want to see the installation question
                 on release notes. If you do not include the OPTIONS N
                 parameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about the release
                 notes. You should review the release notes before
                 proceeding with the installation in case they contain
                 additional information about the installation.

                 If you are restarting the installation and have already
                 reviewed the release notes, you do not need to specify
                 OPTIONS N.

              o  Alternate root option (R)

                 Lets you install the product to a system root other than
                 that of the running system.

              To specify more than one option, separate the options with
              commas (OPTIONS N,R).

              VMSINSTAL has several other options; for more information,
              see the Compaq OpenVMS System Management Utilities
              Reference Manual section on software installation.

    2.5.2 Answering Installation Questions

          This section discusses the questions that appear during
          the installation. Except where noted, the questions are
          the same for both the full development kit and the run-
          time kit options. For sample installation procedures, see
          Appendix A.

          An asterisk (*) marks the beginning of each question.
          Some questions show the default response in brackets,
          for example [YES]. To choose the default response, press
          Return.

          1. Display system status.

             %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
                .
                .
                .
             * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

             VMSINSTAL displays a list of active processes. The
             procedure asks whether you want to continue the
             installation.

             NO is the default response to the question. To stop the
             installation, press Return. Once all active processes
             are stopped, restart the installation procedure.

          2. Confirm system backup.

             * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

    2-4 Installing DECforms Software

 







                 Always back up your system disk before doing an
                 installation. VMSINSTAL asks whether you are satisfied
                 with your system backup. If you are satisfied with the
                 backup of your system disk, press Return. Otherwise,
                 enter NO to stop the installation. After you back up
                 your system disk, you can restart the installation.

              3. Mount the media.

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on MTA0:.
                 * Are you ready? YES
                 %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, FORMS MOUNTED ON _$$MTA0:
                 The following products will be processed:
                   FORMS V3.1

                     Beginning installation of FORMS V3.1 at 15:46

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

                 Mount the first distribution volume on the device
                 that you specified when you ran VMSIN STAL. If you are
                 installing from a directory on a disk, you will be asked
                 the following:

                 * Where will the distribution volumes be mounted:

                 Then VMSINSTAL asks whether you are ready to continue
                 the installation.

                 If you respond YES to indicate that you are ready,
                 VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing
                 DECforms has been mounted on the specified device and
                 that the installation has begun.

                 If you entered the wrong device name when you ran
                 VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, enter
                 NO in response to the "Are you ready?" question. To stop
                 the installation for other reasons, press Ctrl/Y.

              4. Select a Release Notes option.

                 Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

                 Additional Release Notes Options:

                     1. Display release notes
                     2. Print release notes
                     3. Both 1 and 2
                     4. None of the above

             * Select option [2]:

             If you specified OPTIONS N when you ran VMSINSTAL, you
             have four options for reviewing the release notes.

             Option 1 displays the release notes immediately on the
             console terminal. To terminate the display at any time,
             press Ctrl/C.

             Option 2 prompts you for the name of the print queue
             that you want to use:

             * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

             Press Return to print the release notes on SYS$PRINT
             or enter a queue name and press Return. Option 2 is the
             default.

             Option 3 both displays and prints the release notes.

             Option 4 lets you select none of the above. However,
             Compaq does not recommend this.

          5. Continue the installation.

             * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?:  Y
             %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's Release Notes have been moved to SYS$HELP.

             The installation procedure asks whether you
             want to continue the installation. To continue,
             enter YES. Otherwise, press Return. In either
             case, the release notes are copied to the file
             SYS$HELP:FORMS031.RELEASE_NOTES on VAX systems, or
             to the SYS$HELP:FORMSA031.RELEASE_NOTES file on Alpha
             systems. The software version number is represented in
             this file name by the nnn designation (031 for Version
             3.1).

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             The name of the release notes file installed by
             VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name and
             version number. Do not delete previous versions of
             DECforms Release Notes.

             ______________________________________________________

          6. Install the main kit.

             * Do you wish to install the main kit (16000 blocks) [YES]?

    2-6 Installing DECforms Software

 







                 If you are installing the full development kit, the
                 procedure asks whether you want to install the main kit.
                 (The procedure omits this question if you are installing
                 the run-time kit.) The main kit contains all DECforms
                 software except the sample and demo application programs
                 and support for DEC LSE.

              7. Respond to license registration queries.

                          Product:      FORMS
                          Producer:     DEC
                          Version:      3.1
                          Release Date: 06-DEC-1999

                 * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

                 The installation procedure displays license information
                 about your product and asks whether you have registered
                 the license for DECforms. If you have registered the
                 license for DECforms, answer YES. If you have not
                 registered the license, you must answer NO.

                 If you answer NO, the installation continues; however,
                 if you did not register your DECforms license before
                 you started the installation procedure, you cannot run
                 the IVP during the installation. You should run the IVP
                 after you install DECforms and register and load its
                 PAK.

                 Section 1.4 describes registering your DECforms license
                 and Section 2.3 describes verifying the installation of
                 DECforms.

              8. Choose an Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
                 option.

                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

                 The installation procedure asks whether you want to
                 run the IVP. The IVP for DECforms verifies a successful
                 installation. Compaq recommends that you run the IVP.

              9. Install optional DECforms software.

             * Do you wish to install Sample Application Programs (3000 blocks) [YES]?

             * Do you wish to install the demonstration package (12000 blocks) [YES]?

             * Do you wish to install LSEDIT support (250 blocks) [YES]?

             * Do you wish to install modifiable message file procedures (600 blocks)
                [YES]?
             * Do you wish to register DECforms for Oracle TRACE support (50 blocks) [YES]?

             * Do you wish to install DECforms Web Connector support [YES]?

             These six installation questions ask whether you want
             to install the following (if you are installing the run-
             time kit, the procedure omits all but the Oracle TRACE
             and Web Connector support queries):

             o  Sample application programs that demonstrate using
                DECforms.

             o  Demonstration programs that also demonstrate using
                DECforms.

             o  LSEDIT support that includes DEC LSE templates for
                the DECforms Independent Form Description Language
                (IFDL).

                For systems running Version 2.3 of DEC LSE software,
                the following messages may appear when you install
                DEC LSE support:

                %TPU-W-NOTPUVAR, section file missing variable LSE$$HIGLIGHT
                required by editor.
                %FORMS-I-INSLSEEND, installation of LSE support completed

                The warning message does not affect the DECforms
                installation or DEC LSE support.

             o  Modifiable message file procedures that allow
                you to translate DECforms run-time messages
                from English to the language of your choice.
                DECFORMS_MESSAGE.TXT explains how to use
                these procedures. The file is located in
                SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.FORMS.MESSAGES].

             o  Oracle TRACE support that includes a binary
                definition of DECforms Oracle TRACE events.

    2-8 Installing DECforms Software

 







                 o  DECforms Web Connector support, which allows you to
                    run DECforms applications using a Web browser.

             10. Purge files.

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

                 You can purge files from previous versions of
                 DECforms that this installation supersedes. Purging
                 is recommended.

                 To keep files from the previous version, enter NO.

        2.5.3 Informational Messages

              The installation procedure displays a number of
              informational messages that report on the progress of
              the installation. There are no further questions. If the
              installation has been successful, VMSINSTAL moves the new
              or modified files to their target directories, updates help
              files, purges appropriate files, and updates DCL tables, if
              necessary. The procedure displays the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target
                 directories...

        2.5.4 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              If you chose to run the IVP, VMSINSTAL runs it now. The
              procedure displays the following messages for the full
              development kit:

        2.5.5 Completing the Installation Procedure

              The following messages indicate that the installation is
              complete:

                 Installation of FORMS031 V3.1 completed at 10:47

              Enter the products to be processed from the next distribution volume set.
              * Products: ^Z

                     VMSINSTAL procedure done at 10:47

              VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process symbol
              tables during the installation. Therefore, to continue to
              use the system manager's account and these symbols, log out
              and log in again.

        2.6 Error Recovery

              If errors occur during the installation or when the IVP
              is running, VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the
              installation fails, the procedure displays the following
              message:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of DECforms V3.1 has failed.

              If the IVP fails, the procedure displays the following
              messages:

              The DECforms V3.1 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for DECforms V3.1 has failed.

              Errors might occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exists:

              o  The version of the operating system is incorrect.

              o  A required software version is incorrect.

              o  Quotas are insufficient.

              o  System parameter values are insufficient.

              o  The OpenVMS Help library is being used.

              o  The product license has not been registered and loaded.

                                       After Installing DECforms Software


              After installing DECforms software, you might need to do
              the following tasks:

              o  Edit the system startup file to include the DECforms
                 startup procedure.

              o  Access the Hebrew run-time message file.

              o  Set user account privileges and quotas.

              o  Set system parameters.

              o  Make DECforms available on each licensed node in your
                 OpenVMS Cluster system (if you are installing DECforms
                 on an OpenVMS Cluster).

              o  Install the form development utilities.

              This chapter explains how to do these tasks.

        3.1 Editing the System Startup File

              You can provide for automatic startup of DECforms when your
              system is rebooted, and define output formats for dates and
              times other than the standard OpenVMS format, by editing
              the system startup file, SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.

              To cause automatic startup of DECforms, insert the
              following line in the system startup file:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:FORMS$STARTUP.COM

              Include this line with command lines that start up other
              products. The command lines should follow the network
              startup command line, as follows:

                                   After Installing DECforms Software 3-1

 







          $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
               .
               .
               .
          $ @SYS$STARTUP:FORMS$STARTUP.COM

          To have access to date and time formats other than
          the default standard formats, run a procedure named
          LIB$DT_STARTUP.COM in your system startup file. If you
          want this command procedure to define the spellings
          of non-English date and time elements, you must define
          the SYS$LANGUAGES logical name before you run the
          LIB$DT_STARTUP command procedure. The English spellings
          of date and time elements remain available.

          For example, to cause French and German spellings of date
          and time elements and alternate date and time formats, add
          the following commands to SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:

          $ DEFINE SYS$LANGUAGES FRENCH, GERMAN
          $ @SYS$MANAGER:LIB$DT_STARTUP.COM

          You can add the definition of SYS$LANGUAGES and the command
          to run LIB$DT_STARTUP.COM directly after the DECforms
          startup command line.

          For more information on the SYS$LANGUAGES logical name
          and the LIB$DT_STARTUP command procedure, see the OpenVMS
          documentation on date and time formatting routines.

    3.2 Hebrew Installation Notes

          The DECforms
          installation process places the Hebrew run-time message
          file in:

          SYS$MESSAGE:FORMS$MSGMGRSHR_HEBREW.EXE

          The English run-time message file is found in:

          SYS$MESSAGE:FORMS$MSGMGRSHR.EXE

          DECforms uses the English message file by default. To use
          the Hebrew messages, the system manager should replace the
          English file with the Hebrew file, and then reinstall the
          image by performing @SYS$STARTUP:FORMS$STARTUP.

          The user also can use the logical name FORMS$MSGMGRSHR to
          point to the desired language-specific message file.

        3.3 User Account Requirements

              To use DECforms, user accounts on your system must have the
              TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges. The accounts also must have
              the quotas shown in Table 3-1.

              Table 3-1 Minimum User Account Quotas for Developing
              __________DECforms_Applications____________________________

              Account_Quota____Minimum_Value_____________________________

              BYTLM            16384

              PRCLM____________3_________________________________________

              User account privileges and quotas are stored in the file
              SYSUAF.DAT.

              To verify and change user account privileges and quotas,
              use the Authorize Utility as follows:

              1. Set your directory to SYS$SYSTEM and run the Authorize
                 Utility:

                 $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
                 $ RUN AUTHORIZE
                 UAF>

              2. To check a particular account, at the Authorize Utility
                 prompt (UAF>) enter the SHOW command with an account
                 name. For example:

                 UAF> SHOW SMITH

              3. To change a privilege or quota, enter the MODIFY command
                 in the following syntax:

                 MODIFY account-name /PRIVILEGES=privilege-name/quota-
        name=nnnn

                 The following example adds the NETMBX privilege,
                 modifies the BYTLM quota for the SMITH account, and
                 exits the utility:

                 UAF> MODIFY SMITH /PRIVILEGES=NETMBX /BYTLM=16384
                 UAF> EXIT

                                   After Installing DECforms Software 3-3

 







             After you exit the utility, the OpenVMS operating system
             displays messages indicating whether changes were made.
             Once you have made the changes, users must log out and
             log in again for the new privileges and quotas to take
             effect.

          For more information on modifying account privileges and
          quotas, see the Compaq OpenVMS System Management Utilities
          Reference Manual.

    3.4 System Parameters

          Table 3-2 shows the minimum values to which certain system
          parameters should be set when users develop DECforms
          applications on your system.

              __________DECforms_Applications____________________________

              System
              Parameter________Minimum_Value_____________________________

              PQL_MBYTLM       16384

              PQL_MPRCLM       3

              the run-time kit.
              ___________________________________________________________

              To change system parameters, do the following:

              1. Edit the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT.

                 To change the value of a parameter that is listed in the
                 MODPARAMS.DAT file, use an editor to locate the line
                 containing that parameter. Delete the current value
                 associated with that parameter and enter the new value.

                 To add a new value, add a line to the MODPARAMS.DAT
                 file. Make sure you include both the name of the
                 parameter and its value in the new line. For
                 example, to include a setting for the PQL_MBYTLM and
                 PQL_MPRCLM parameters, add the following lines to the
                 MODPARAMS.DAT file:

                 PQL_MBYTLM=16384
                 PQL_MPRCLM=3

              2. Run the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
                 parameters.

                 After you have modified the MODPARAMS.DAT file and
                 exited the editor, enter the following command:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

                 AUTOGEN does an automatic system shutdown and reboots
                 once it has finished. Rebooting your system activates
                 the new parameter values. For more information about
                 using AUTOGEN, see the instructions on modifying system
                 parameters in the OpenVMS documentation on system
                 management and operations.

    3.5 Cluster Considerations

          After you install DECforms on an OpenVMS Cluster system,
          you must do the following tasks on each licensed node in
          the OpenVMS Cluster system:

          o  Run the DECforms startup command procedure.

          o  Install DCLTABLES.EXE.

          o  Register the license for DECforms.

          o  Run the full development kit IVP (if you are installing
             the full development kit) and the run-time kit IVP.

          To run the startup command procedure, log into a node in
          the OpenVMS Cluster system and enter the following command:

          $ @SYS$STARTUP:FORMS$STARTUP.COM

          To install DCLTABLES.EXE, enter the following command:

          $ INSTALL REPLACE SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES.EXE/OPEN/SHARE/HEADER

          To register the DECforms license on a node, see
          Section 1.4. To run the full development kit and run-time
          kit IVPs, see Section 2.3.

    3.6 Installing the Form Development Utilities as Shared Images

          DECforms provides the following form development utilities:

          o  Form Development Environment (FDE)

          o  Character-cell Panel Editor (CCPED)

          o  Motif-based Panel Editor (MPED)

          o  IFDL Translator

          o  Back Translator

          o  Layout Converter

          o  Extract Utility

          o  Test Utility

          o  FMS Converter

          If you use these form development utilities extensively
          on your system, you can install them as shared images to
          reduce the system overhead and memory requirements.

    3-6 After Installing DECforms Software

 







              To install the form development utilities as shared images,
              do the following:

              1. Determine the number of available global pages and
                 global sections on your system. For information on how
                 to verify and modify the number of global pages and
                 global sections, see Section 1.5.4.

                 To install the form development utilities as shared
                 images, you must increase the number of global pages by
                 6000 and the number of global sections by 30. These are
                 increases over what is required during installation.
                 Install the utilities just after you start your system.
                 The available space in the global page table is less
                 likely to be fragmented.

              2. To install the form development utilities as shared
                 images on a currently running system, enter the
                 following command:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:FORMS$STARTUP.COM  DEVELOP

                 To install the utilities as shared images each time
                 your system is rebooted, add the DEVELOP parameter
                 to the line you added to the system startup file,
                 SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM (see Section 3.1), as
                 follows:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
                      .
                      .
                      .
                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:FORMS$STARTUP.COM  DEVELOP

              To install selected form utilities, use the OpenVMS Install
              Utility (INSTALL). For example, to install only the
              Character-cell Panel Editor as a shared image, enter the
              following commands:







                                   After Installing DECforms Software 3-7

 







          $ INSTALL
          INSTALL> ADD SYS$LIBRARY:FORMS$FSESHR.EXE /OPEN /SHARED /HEADER
          INSTALL> ADD SYS$LIBRARY:FORMS$PEDSHR.EXE /OPEN /SHARED /HEADER
          INSTALL> ADD SYS$MESSAGE:FORMS$MSGPRDSHR.EXE /OPEN /SHARED /HEADER
          INSTALL> ADD SYS$LIBRARY:FORMS$PEDVTEXEC.EXE /OPEN /SHARED /HEADER
          INSTALL> EXIT

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             You must install FORMS$FSESHR.EXE and
             FORMS$MSGPRDSHR.EXE with the first form development
             utility that you install. Once you have installed
             these two images, you need not reinstall them to add
             other form development utilities.

             ______________________________________________________

    3.7 Determining and Reporting Problems

          If an error occurs while DECforms is being used and you
          believe that a problem with DECforms is causing the error,
          take one of the following actions:

          o  If you have a BASIC or DECsupport Software Agreement,
             call your Customer Support Center.

          o  If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement,
             submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

          o  If you purchased DECforms within the past 90 days and
             you think a software error is causing the error, submit
             an SPR.

          If you find an error in the DECforms documentation, please
          see the Send Us Your Comments section in the Preface for
          instructions.

                                          VAX Systems Sample Installation


              This appendix contains a sample installation of Compaq
              DECforms software. Depending on which layered products you
              have on your system, you might see additional messages and
              questions when you install Compaq DECforms software.

              The sample installation assumes the following:

              o  DECnet has been shut down.[1]

              o  No users are logged in to the system.

              o  The installation kit is in SYS$UPDATE.

              o  OPTIONS N is specified during the full development kit
                 installation to print the release notes, but not during
                 the run-time kit installation.

              o  The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs after
                 each kit has been installed.

        A.1 Full Development Kit

              Example A-1 contains a sample installation for the DECforms
              full development kit on a VAX system.

              [1]   Although it is not necessary to shut down DECnet to
                    perform a successful DECforms installation, VMSINSTAL

                    checks to see if DECnet is shut down.

        * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded? y

                   This kit contains an Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
                   to  verify the correct installation of DECforms.  Because the
                   IVP requires interactive operator input, it must be run using a
                   VT100, VT200, VT300, VT400, or VT500 compatible video terminal.
                   If you are using one of these terminal types, you may run the
                   procedure immediately after installation by answering "YES" to
                   the IVP prompt. Or you may choose to invoke it later using
                   the following:

                   @SYS$TEST:FORMS$RT_IVP.COM

        * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

        * Do you wish to register DECforms for Oracle TRACE support (50 blocks) [YES]?

         the Oracle TRACE registrar.

                                        Alpha Systems Sample Installation


              This appendix contains a sample installation of Compaq
              DECforms software. Depending on which layered products you
              have on your system, you might see additional messages and
              questions when you install Compaq DECforms software.

              The sample installation assumes the following:

              o  DECnet has been shut down.[1]

              o  No users are logged in to the system.

              o  The installation kit is in SYS$UPDATE.

              o  OPTIONS N is specified during the full development kit
                 installation to print the release notes, but not during
                 the run-time kit installation.

              o  The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs after
                 each kit has been installed.

        B.1 Full Development Kit

              Example B-1 contains a sample installation for the DECforms
              full development kit on an Alpha system.







              ____________________
              [1]   Although it is not necessary to shut down DECnet to
                    perform a successful DECforms installation, VMSINSTAL

                    checks to see if DECnet is shut down.

                   This kit contains an Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
                   to  verify the correct installation of DECforms. Because the
                   IVP requires interactive operator input, it must be run using a
                   VT100, VT200, VT300, VT400, or VT500 compatible video terminal.
                   If you are using one of these terminal types, you may run the
                   procedure immediately after installation by answering "YES" to
                   the IVP prompt. O you may choose to invoke it later using
                   the following:

                   @SYS$TEST:FORMS$RT_IVP.COM

        * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

        * Do you wish to register DECforms for Oracle TRACE support (50 blocks) [YES]?
