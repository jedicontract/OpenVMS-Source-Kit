PRODUCT NAME:   Compaq Device Access Software for Siemens 3964 V3.1 SPD
60.47.06

DESCRIPTION

The Compaq Device Access Software (DAS) for Siemens 3964 allows both
BASEstar Open users and Compaq OMNI applications to access Siemens 3964
devices using the 3964[R] or 3964[R]_RK512 protocol.

The DAS also allows a Compaq system to emulate one or more Siemens 3964
devices. In this way, a Compaq system can fulfill requests coming from
3964 remote devices.

BASEstar Open Data Services provide device independent access to shop
floor data allowing users to access data on a Siemens 3964 device sim-
ply by getting and putting the value of one or more Device_Data_Points.
A request to locally-emulated devices can generate an unsolicited event.

Compaq OMNI API applications can perform a variety of device access
functions through the Compaq OMNI MMS-oriented Application Program-
ming Interface (API).

Using BASEstar Open Data Services or the Compaq OMNI API, users or ap-
plications can:

o  Exchange data messages with Siemens devices (3964[R] protocols)

o  Perform direct or named access to Siemens devices memory blocks (3964[R]_
   RK512 protocols).

The DAS supports only point-to-point RS232 connections.

On OpenVMS and Tru64 UNIX platforms, the DAS supports both direct and
LAT connections to the device. On Windows NT platforms, the DAS sup-
ports direct connections only.
