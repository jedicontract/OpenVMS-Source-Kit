          Dear Customer:

          This letter contains important information that will help you
          understand and use DECelms (DEC Extended LAN Management Soft-
          ware) Version 1.0.


          New Product Features

          DECelms V1.0 is a replacement product for Remote Bridge Manage-
          ment Software V2.0 (RBMS V2.0). DECelms V1.0 manages extended
          LANs comprised of Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 segments and FDDI rings by
          providing support for the new DECconcentrator 500 and DECbridge
          500. It continues to support Digital's Ethernet/ IEEE 802.3
          bridges: the LAN Bridge 100, LAN Bridge 150, and LAN Bridge 200.
          DECelms also displays SMT information for FDDI stations.

          Customers whose extended LANs currently contain only Ether-
          net/IEEE 802.3 segments will appreciate the many functional and
          ease-of-use enhancements in DECelms. These enhancements include
          a streamlined command interface, a new display interface, an
          autoconfiguring device registry, event messages, and an event
          log.

          Installation into DECmcc SMS or DECmcc EMS

          The DECelms installation dialog contains a new prompt about
          installing DECelms into DECmcc Site Management Station (SMS) or
          DECmcc Enterprise Management Station (EMS). This prompt is not
          described in the DECelms Installation guide, but it is fully
          described in the release notes. Answer YES to install DECelms

          Release Notes

          Please read the on-line release notes for more information about
          DECelms V1.0. To read the release notes, specify OPTIONS N when

          Documentation

          The DECelms Installation guide explains how to prepare your
          system, install
          DECelms, and verify the installation. The DECelms Use manual
          describes how to perform management tasks with DECelms. The
          DECelms Reference guide provides reference information on the
          DECelms commands. The Fiber Distributed Data Interface Sys-
          tem Level Description describes the FDDI standard, Digital's
          implementation, and the operation of FDDI bridges and wiring
          concentrators. The Bridge and Extended LAN Reference provides
          conceptual information on bridge operation.
