                                                                  Preface



              This guide describes the installation procedure and the
              system configuration utility for the Compaq Distributed
              Computing Environment (DCE) for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS
              Alpha Version 3.0, which consists of the following
              services:

              o  Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service provides
                 connectivity between individual procedures in an
                 application across heterogeneous systems in a
                 transparent way.

              o  Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiler is required
                 for developing distributed DCE applications.

              o  Threads service provides user-mode control and
                 synchronization of multiple operations. Threads is
                 packaged with the base operating system.

              o  Cell Directory Service (CDS) provides a location-
                 independent method of identifying resources within a
                 cell. A cell is the smallest group of DCE systems that
                 share a common naming and security domain.

              o  DCE Security Service provides authentication and
                 authorization within a cell and is based on MIT's
                 Kerberos private key encryption system.

              o  Distributed Time Service (DTS) provides date and time
                 synchronization within a cell.

              Four kits are installed:

                 Runtime Services Kit

             objects

          o  RPC Control Program (rpccp)

          o  DCE Control Program (dcecp)

          o  Name Service Interface Daemon (nsid); also known as the
             PC Nameserver Proxy

          o  Native Kerberos

          o  XDS Directory Services

          o  XDS Object Management

                                               Preparing for Installation


              This chapter describes the preparations you must make
              before you install and configure the Compaq Distributed
              Computing Environment (DCE) for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS
              Alpha software.

              Compaq DCE is an enabling software technology for the
              development of distributed applications. It provides a
              variety of common services needed for the development
              of distributed applications, such as name services and a
              standard remote procedure call interface.

        1.1 Planning for Installation and Configuration

              This section helps you plan for the installation and
              configuration of the Compaq DCE. It presents a brief
              overview of some concepts that you need to understand
              before you install and configure Compaq DCE software. This
              understanding can help you decide how to configure DCE.
              Refer to Understanding DCE for detailed explanations of DCE
              concepts.

              The installation and configuration procedures set up the
              DCE environment so that you can use DCE services. Before
              you can use Compaq DCE software, you must both install the
              software and configure DCE on your system.

        1.1.1 What Is a Cell?

              A cell is the basic DCE unit consisting of a group of nodes
              that share a directory service namespace and a security
              service registry under a common administration. Usually,
              the nodes in a cell are in the same geographic area, but
              cell boundaries are not limited by geography. Although a
              cell can contain from one to several thousand nodes, each
              node can belong only to one cell at a time.

                                           Preparing for Installation 1-1

 



    Preparing for Installation
    1.1 Planning for Installation and Configuration


          The system configuration utility allows you to join an
          existing cell. The cell must provide a directory server
          and a security server. These servers may be resident on the
          same system or may be running on separate systems.

          Note that if you rely on DCE time services for time
          synchronization, by default, you need a minimum of three
          time servers to synchronize time in a cell. See the
          section on the DCE Distributed Time Service in the OSF
          DCE Administration Guide for more information.

    1.1.2 Creating a Cell

          See Chapter 4 for cell configuration guidelines.

    1.1.3 Joining a Cell

          You need the following information to join a DCE cell:

          o  Full cell name

          o  Host name of the DCE Security Server

          o  Security principal name and password authorized to
             perform cell administration operations

          o  Location of the cell's CDS server (on or not on the same
             LAN as you are)

          When the client joining the cell is on the same LAN as
          the CDS directory master server, the CDS advertiser
          automatically determines the server's location by using
          IP (Internet Protocol) broadcast packets. If the CDS master
          server is not on the LAN, then you need to provide the host
          name where the CDS master server is running.

    1.2 Inspecting the Distribution Kit

          The Software Bill of Materials (BOM) included with
          your distribution kit specifies the contents of your
          distribution kit. Carefully compare the items you received
          with the items listed in the BOM. If any components are
          missing or damaged, contact your Compaq customer service
          representative before you continue with the installation.

                                      1.2 Inspecting the Distribution Kit


              The Read Before Installing letter listed on your BOM
              provides important information that you should be aware
              of before you install Compaq DCE. Some of this information
              may not be included in either this guide or the release
              notes.

              Compaq DCE provides online release notes. Read the release
              notes before you install the product. They contain
              information about changes to the product. For example,
              the release notes contain important information on
              modifications you should make to TCP/IP parameters before
              you begin the installation.

        1.3 Troubleshooting

              The Compaq DCE for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Product
              Guide includes a chapter on troubleshooting. Read this
              chapter if you are having installation or configuration
              problems. For example, the Troubleshooting chapter
              discusses problems you may encounter with time and time
              zones.

        1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The following sections discuss the requirements for
              installing Compaq DCE.

              The length of time the installation takes to complete
              depends on the type of machine, the load on that machine,
              and the kit you choose to install.

        1.4.1 Required Hardware

              To perform the installation, you need the following
              hardware:

              o  A processor running OpenVMS VAX or Alpha Version 6.2 or
                 higher.

              o  A software distribution device, if you are installing
                 the software from media. You need a distribution device
                 that corresponds with the software distribution media.

    1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements


             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Systems running OpenVMS Alpha should have access to a
             CD-ROM reader so you can install the software. Please
             check to see that you have a CD-ROM reader installed.

             ______________________________________________________

    1.4.2 Required Software

          This section describes the software that must be installed
          on an OpenVMS system before you can properly perform the
          installation, configure the system, or use the software.
          In cases where the minimum version is not specified,
          refer to the Software Product Description (SPD) for more
          information.

    1.4.2.1 On OpenVMS Alpha and VAX Systems

          Before installing Compaq DCE, you need the following
          software on your system:

          o  OpenVMS Version 6.2 or higher

          o  DECnet Phase IV or DECnet/OSI

             DECnet is required only if you run applications that use
             DECnet as their transport.

          o  Compaq TCP/IP Services Version 4.2 or higher

             You must have Compaq TCP/IP Services installed and
             configured on each host from which you plan to execute
             DCE applications. See Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS
             Installation and Configuration for more information
             about the UDP/IP and TCP/IP transports.

             If you plan to use MultiNet or TCPware from Process
             Software or Pathway from Wollongong (instead of Compaq's
             TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS), please see the release
             notes for more information.

          o  If you are installing the Application Developer's
             Kit and plan on using the LSE templates, LSE and an
             appropriate license must be installed before you install
             DCE.

                                  1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements


        1.4.3 Time Required for Installation

              Depending on your configuration, the installation can take
              from 10 to 30 minutes.

        1.4.4 Disk Space, Global Pages, and Global Sections Required

              The disk space, global pages, and global sections
              requirements of Compaq DCE are different for the DCE
              Runtime Services Kit (RTK) and for the Application
              Developer's Kit (ADK). These requirements also differ
              on OpenVMS VAX and on OpenVMS Alpha systems. Table 1-1
              lists the requirements before the installation for each kit
              on each platform. (Disk space requirements are listed in
              blocks.) Note that the DCE CDS Server and Security Server
              images are part of the DCE Kit and are enabled by license
              PAKs.

              To determine how much free disk space is on your system
              disk, enter the following command:

              $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

              The system responds with a short table; the column labeled
              Free Blocks shows the amount of storage space remaining
              on your system disk. If there is not enough disk space to
              install or to run Compaq DCE, work with your system manager
              to delete and purge files that are no longer needed.

    1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements


          To determine the number of free global pages and global
          sections on your system, enter the following commands:

          $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")

          $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")

          If the values displayed by the system are greater than
          the minimum required, your system has adequate free global
          pages and global sections. If the values are less than
          the minimum required, use the AUTOGEN command procedure to
          increase the values, as follows:

          $ EDIT SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

          For details on using AUTOGEN, see the OpenVMS System
          Manager's Manual.

    1.4.5 Privileges and Quotas Required

          To install Compaq DCE for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha,
          log in to the system manager account. If you are not logged
          in to the system manager's account during installation, you
          must have at least the SETPRV privilege. To determine the
          privileges you have, enter the following command:

          $ SHOW PROCESS/PRIVILEGES

          If you do not have sufficient privileges to install Compaq
          DCE, see your system manager.

          The DCE system management utility requires WORLD privileges
          for the SHOW command and WORLD, SYSPRV, and CMKRNL
          privileges for all other commands.

          You should also check to make sure you have adequate quotas
          for the installation. You need the following quota values:

          o  ASTLM = 24

          o  BIOLM = 18

          o  BYTLM = 18000

          o  DIOLM = 18

          o  ENQLM = 30

          o  FILLM = 20

                                  1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements


              Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility if you want to verify
              and change process quotas for the installation account in
              the user authorization file (UAF). For example, to change
              the BYTLM quota for your installation account, enter the
              following command sequence:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE
              UAF> MODIFY account-name /BYTLM = 18000
              UAF> SHOW account-name
              UAF> EXIT
              $ LOGOUT

              After you change the quotas for your installation account,
              log out of the installation account and log in again for
              the new quotas to take effect. You can then proceed with
              the installation.

              User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT.
              For more information on modifying account quotas, see the
              description of the Authorize Utility in the OpenVMS system
              management documentation.

        1.4.6 Completing License Management Facility Requirements

              If you are installing only the Runtime Services Kit of
              Compaq DCE, you do not need a separate license. The right
              to use the Compaq DCE Runtime Services Kit is granted with
              the OpenVMS operating system.

              The installation procedure for DCE installs the following
              kits by default without checking for licences: DCE Runtime
              Services, CDS Server Kit, and the Security Server Kit. To
              install the Application Developer's Kit, you must override
              the installation defaults by answering NO to the following
              question:

              Do you want the defaults for all options? [YES]

              If you are installing the Application Developer's Kit and
              plan on using LSE templates, LSE and an appropriate license
              must be installed before you install DCE.

              To register a license under OpenVMS, first log in to the
              system manager's account, SYSTEM. Then use either of two
              ways to perform the registration:

    Preparing for Installation
    1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements


          o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it
             prompts you for information, respond with data from your
             License PAK.

          o  At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command
             with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to
             License PAK information.

          The license for the Application Developer's Kit is DCE-
          APP-DEV. The license for the Security Server Kit is DCE-
          SECURITY. The license for the CDS Server Kit is DCE-CDS.

          Although it is necessary to have only one license active
          for this product, the License Management Facility (LMF)
          checks for the existence of any valid license. If LMF
          displays license failures for some of these other licenses,
          disregard the messages.

          If you plan to use Compaq DCE on more than one node in
          a VMScluster environment, you must register and load a
          license for each of the other nodes before you configure
          them.

          For complete information about using LMF, see the OpenVMS
          License Management Utility Manual.

    1.4.7 Performing System Backup

          Back up your system disk before installing any software.
          Use the backup procedures established at your site. For
          details on backing up a system disk, see the OpenVMS Backup
          Utility Manual.

    1.4.8 Installing DCE Version 3.0 Over Previous Versions

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             If you are installing Compaq DCE for OpenVMS VAX or
             OpenVMS Alpha Version 3.0 over a previous version
             of DCE, you do not have to reconfigure DCE after the
             installation. Before the installation, stop the DCE

             $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP CLEAN

             Then, after the installation, enter the following
             command:

                $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP START

                You must reconfigure if you are installing DCE for the
                first time or if you are installing a new version over
                DCE Version 1.0.

                ______________________________________________________

              If you are installing DCE over an existing Compaq DCE for
              OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha, perform the following steps:

              1. Stop the DCE daemons with the following commands:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP CLEAN

                 If you are installing DCE over an existing Compaq DCE
                 for OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha prior to Version 1.5,
                 you do not need to complete the RPC shutdown step. The
                 RPC shutdown is done automatically as part of the CLEAN
                 operation in DCE$SETUP.COM. DCE$RPC_SHUTDOWN should be
                 executed for DCE Version 1.5 only. As in prior versions,
                 DCE$SETUP.COM in DCE Version 3.0 automatically shuts
                 down RPC as part of a CLEAN, STOP, or CONFIG operation.

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$RPC_SHUTDOWN

              2. After the installation, enter the following command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP START

                                                           Installing DCE


              This chapter describes the installation procedure for
              Compaq DCE for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha.

              You can use different media to install Compaq DCE. The
              examples in this chapter show the installation procedure
              using disk files.

              See Appendix B for logs of sample installations.

        2.1 About the OpenVMS Installation Procedure

              This section gives a brief overview of the OpenVMS
              installation procedure for Compaq DCE Version 3.0 called
              DCE$INSTALL.COM. The OpenVMS installation command has the
              following format:

              $ @DKA300:[000000]DCE$INSTALL [HELP]

              where:

              o  DKA300: is a device name on which the distribution
                 volumes will be mounted. Remember that all Alpha systems
                 come with CD-ROM readers.

              o  DCE$INSTALL is the supplied command procedure that
                 drives the installation.

              It is not necessary to use the console drive to install
              DCE. If you do use the console drive, replace any media you
              remove from the drive.

              Include the optional parameter HELP if you want PCSI to
              display help information.

              When you invoke DCE$INSTALL, it checks the following
              conditions:

              o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account.
                 Install software from the system manager's account with
                 your default device and directory set to SYS$UPDATE.

    2.1 About the OpenVMS Installation Procedure


          o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation. See
             Section 1.4.5 for more information on quota values.

          You can stop the installation at any time by pressing
          Ctrl/C or Ctrl/Y. However, files created up to that point
          are not deleted. You must delete these files manually,
          using the OpenVMS DELETE command. Appendix A lists the
          files and directories created during the installation
          procedure.

    2.2 Starting the Compaq DCE Installation Procedure

          See Section 1.4.2 for more information about software
          requirements.

          Start the installation procedure as follows:

          1. Log in to the account from which you are installing the
             Compaq DCE.

          2. If you are installing a kit other than the Runtime
             Services Kit, make sure you have registered the
             appropriate LMF PAK.

          3. Invoke the following command procedure, substituting
             the correct name of your media device and directory for
             DKA300 (used in the example):

             $ @DKA300:[000000]DCE$INSTALL HELP

    2.3 Continuing the Installation

          This section describes the part of the installation
          procedure that is specific to DCE.

          $ @DKA300:[000000]dce$install help

                  Performing DCE pre-installation tasks...please wait.

          Creating a DCE$SERVER Account

          If you do not already have a DCE$SERVER account, the
          installation procedure creates one for you with TMPMBX,
          NETMBX, DETACH, and SYSPRV privileges.

                                          2.3 Continuing the Installation


           This installation procedure has detected an existing DCE$SERVER
           account. Correct operation of DCE on this system requires that the
           DCE$SERVER account have TMPMBX, NETMBX, DETACH and SYSPRV privileges.

           The installation procedure will modify the DCE$SERVER account to 
           ensure that the prerequisite privileges are present.

              Description of Kits

              The installation procedure displays information about the
              four Compaq DCE kits (Runtime Services Kit, Application
              Developers' Kit, Security Server Kit, and CDS Server Kit).
              Depending on the kit, the procedure displays specific
              information about the kit that will be installed.

                  Greetings!

                  This is DCE V3.0 for OpenVMS Alpha.
                  There are four components: the DCE Runtime Services, the
                  DCE Application Development Kit, the DCE Security Server,
                  and the DCE CDS Server.

                   1. The Runtime Services provides the core services necessary 
                      to execute and manage DCE applications.

                   2. The Application Development Kit provides the services and 
                      tools required to develop, execute, and manage DCE 
                      applications. The Runtime Services capability is 
                      automatically provided with the Application Development 
                      Kit.

                   3. The security server supplies support for a cell wide 
                      security database. A cell must have at least one system 
                      running a security server.

                   4. The CDS server supplies support for a cell wide naming 
                      database. A cell must have at least one system running 
                      a CDS server.

    2.4 Installing on a VMScluster

          On a VMScluster with a common system disk, you need only
          install Compaq DCE once. After the initial installation,
          ensure that a separate license is registered and loaded on
          each cluster member that you plan to use for DCE services.

          If you are installing DCE for OpenVMS over an existing
          version of DCE on a common system disk in a VMScluster
          environment, be sure to shut down DCE on all nodes that
          share the common system disk before the installation.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             You must configure each node separately.

                                              Postinstallation Procedures


              This chapter describes postinstallation steps that you
              need to take and lists ways to recover from errors that you
              encounter during the installation.

        3.1 Postinstallation Tasks

              After the installation is completed successfully, note the
              following.

              1. DCE Version 3.0 provides support for the RPC runtime
                 environment and RPC applications (which are not
                 dependent on DCE services) to remain active when
                 DCE is shut down. This requires the use of separate
                 startup files: SYS$STARTUP:DCE$RPC_STARTUP.COM and
                 SYS$STARTUP:DCE$STARTUP.COM.

                 On OpenVMS VAX and Alpha Version 7.2 and higher, the RPC
                 runtime environment files are shipped with the operating
                 system. When installing DCE Version 3.0 on OpenVMS VAX
                 and Alpha Version 6.2 through 7.1, DCE provides the RPC
                 runtime environment files.

                 On OpenVMS Version 7.2 and higher, the DCE installation
                 may update the RPC files provided by the system if the
                 DCE installation files are more recent.

                 If you want all of the configured DCE services to start
                 with the system startup, add the following line to
                 SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM after the startup commands
                 for the network transports, DECnet, and/or Compaq TCP/IP
                 services:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:DCE$STARTUP.COM



                                          Postinstallation Procedures 3-1

 



    Postinstallation Procedures
    3.1 Postinstallation Tasks


             If you want only the RPC runtime environment to start
             with the system startup, add the following line to
             SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:

             $ @SYS$STARTUP:DCE$RPC_STARTUP.COM

             It is not necessary to run both procedures. Invoking
             DCE$STARTUP.COM will first start the RPC Runtime, then
             the DCE services. See Chapter 4 for more information
             about configuring DCE.

          2. Depending on your choice for system startup, add the
             following commands to SYS$MANAGER:SYSHUTDWN.COM before
             the shutdown commands for the network transports,
             DECnet, and/or DEC TCP/IP services:

             o  If you have configured DCE services on your system:

                $ @SYS$STARTUP:DCE$SHUTDOWN.COM

             o  If you have the RPC runtime environment only:

                $ @SYS$STARTUP:DCE$RPC_SHUTDOWN.COM NOCONFIRM

             If DCE$SHUTDOWN.COM is added to the system shutdown
             file, it will prompt you for a password before shutting
             down DCE. This will delay the shutdown until the
             password is specified.

          3. Configure this node by entering the following command:

             $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP CONFIG

             You must configure the DCE services before you can
             use them. See Chapter 5 for more information about
             configuring DCE.

          4. If you are running DCE server applications that are
             listening over the DECnet Phase IV (ncacn_dnet_nsp)
             protocol or the DECnet/OSI (ncacn_dnet_nsp) protocol,
             you must grant the NET$DECLAREOBJECT rights identifier
             to those processes from which the server runs.

          5. Define foreign commands. There are two foreign command
             definition files: one file contains required commands
             and the other file is optional. Add the following line
             to the file SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM:

    Postinstallation Procedures
    3.1 Postinstallation Tasks


             If you choose not to execute this command definition
             file, you cannot use any of the previous programs and
             commands.

             DCE$DEFINE_OPTIONAL_COMMANDS.COM, the optional command
             definition file, is installed with the Application
             Development kit and defines the following foreign
             commands:

             o  idl, which invokes the IDL compiler

             o  rpclm, which invokes the RPC Log Manager

             o  uuidgen, which invokes the UUID generator utility

             By default, these utilities use DCL-style interfaces. If
             you execute the optional foreign commands file, you have
             access to the version of these utilities that uses the
             universal interface. There are three possible actions
             that you can take:

             o  Define the universal interface for all users on your
                system to ensure that the same interface is available
                to users across operating system platforms. Note that
                all examples that document these four utilities use
                the universal interface. Include the following line
                in the file SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM:

                $ @SYS$COMMON:[DCE$LIBRARY]DCE$DEFINE_OPTIONAL_COMMANDS.COM

             o  Give users access to only the DCL-style interface. In
                this case, you do not need to take any action.

             o  Make the DCL-style interface available to some users,
                but allow others access to the universal interface.
                Do not define the optional commands in SYLOGIN.COM.
                Tell users who want to use the universal interface
                to include the following line in their account's
                LOGIN.COM procedure:

                $ @SYS$COMMON:[DCE$LIBRARY]DCE$DEFINE_OPTIONAL_COMMANDS.COM

          6. If you are installing DCE on a VMScluster, you must take
             the following steps:

             a. Ensure that a license is registered and loaded on
                each node in the cluster from which users plan to
                use DCE. (If you are installing only the Compaq DCE
                Runtime Services Kit, you already have a right to use

                    the DCE Runtime Services Kit. This right was granted
                    with the OpenVMS operating system license.)

                 b. Configure each node in the cluster from which users
                    plan to use DCE by entering the following command:

                    $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP CONFIG

        3.2 Installation Error Recovery

              The following list describes errors that you may encounter
              during installation and provides suggestions about how to
              recover from those errors:

              o  You try to install the OpenVMS VAX kit on an OpenVMS
                 Alpha system (or vice versa).

                 Reinstall with the correct kit.

              o  The system does not have the required version of OpenVMS
                 installed.

                 Upgrade the operating system to at least the minimum
                 required version and restart the installation procedure.

              o  You run out of disk space.

                 Either clean up your disk or install less of the kit.

              o  If you plan to run DCE applications by IP, you must have
                 UCX Version 4.2 installed.

                 Install the correct version of UCX. The installation
                 procedure checks for the prerequisites.

              o  No network transports were found.

                 You must install and configure DECnet, UCX, or both
                 before running any DCE applications.

              o  SYS$SYSTEM:RIGHTSLIST.DAT does not exist on this system.

                 RUN AUTHORIZE and then issue the CREATE/RIGHTS command.
                 RIGHTSLIST.DAT is created for you.

              o  Invalid UIC.

                 Find and enter the correct UIC in the correct format.

                                                   Configuring a DCE Cell


              This chapter describes the steps necessary to set up a DCE
              cell, and the DCE system configuration utility for Compaq
              DCE for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha. Note that DCE must
              be configured.

        4.1 Overview of the DCE Cell

              A cell is the basic DCE unit. It is a group of networked
              systems and resources that share common DCE services.
              Usually, the systems in a cell are in the same geographic
              area, but cell boundaries are not limited by geography.
              A cell can contain from one to several thousand systems.
              The boundaries of a cell are typically determined by
              its purpose, as well as by security, administrative, and
              performance considerations.

              A DCE cell is a group of systems that share a namespace
              under a common administration. The configuration procedure
              allows you to configure your system as a DCE client, create
              a new DCE cell, add a master Cell Directory Service (CDS)
              server, add a replica CDS server, and add a Distributed
              Time Service (DTS) local server. When you create a new
              cell, you automatically configure a Security server.

              You do not need to create a DCE cell if you are using
              only the DCE Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and if your
              applications use only explicit RPC string bindings to
              provide the binding information that connects server
              to clients. If there are other systems in your network
              already using DCE services, it is possible there may be
              an existing cell that your system can join. If you are not
              sure, consult your network administrator to find out which
              DCE services may already be in use in your network.

    Configuring a DCE Cell
    4.1 Overview of the DCE Cell


          At a minimum, a cell configuration includes the DCE Cell
          Directory Service, the DCE Security Service, and the DCE
          Distributed Time Service. One system in the cell must
          provide a DCE Directory Service server to store the cell
          namespace database. You can choose to install both the Cell
          Directory Server and the Security Server on the system from
          which you invoked the procedure, or you can split the two
          servers and put them on different systems.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             You must run the installation and configuration
             procedures on the system where you are creating a cell
             before you install and configure DCE on the systems
             that are joining the cell.

             ______________________________________________________

    4.1.1 Creating a Cell

          All DCE systems participate in a cell. If you are
          installing DCE and there is no cell to join, the first
          system on which you install the software is also the system
          on which you create the cell. Remember that this system is
          also the DCE Security Server. You can also make this system
          your Cell Directory Server.

          When you create a cell, you must name it. The cell name
          must be unique across your global network. The name is
          used by all cell members to indicate the cell in which they
          participate. The configuration procedure provides a default
          name that is unique and is easy to remember. If you choose
          a name other than the default, the name must be unique. If
          you want to ensure that separate cells can communicate, the
          cell name must follow BIND or X.500 naming conventions.

    4.1.2 Joining a Cell

          Once the first DCE system is installed and configured
          and a cell is created, you can install and configure the
          systems that join that cell. During configuration, you
          need the name of the cell you are joining. Ask your network
          administrator for the cell name.

                                             4.1 Overview of the DCE Cell


        4.1.3 Defining a Cell Name

              You need to define a name for your DCE cell that is unique
              in your global network and is the same on all systems
              that participate in this cell. The DCE naming environment
              supports two kinds of names: global names and local names.
              All entries in the DCE Directory Service have a global name
              that is universally meaningful and usable from anywhere
              in the DCE naming environment. All Directory Service
              entries also have a cell-relative name that is meaningful
              and usable only from within the cell in which that entry
              exists. If you plan to connect this cell to other DCE
              cells in your network either now or in the future, it is
              important that you choose an appropriate name for this
              cell. You cannot change the name of the cell once the
              cell has been created. If you are not sure how to choose
              an appropriate name for your DCE cell, consult Chapter
              9 of the Compaq DCE for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha
              Product Guide, or the section on global names in the
              OSF DCE Administration Guide - Introduction. Before you
              can register the cell in X.500, you must ensure that the
              Compaq X.500 Directory Service kit is installed on your CDS
              server.

              Compaq recommends that you use the following convention
              to create DCE cell names: the Internet name of your host
              system followed by the suffix - cell, followed by the
              Internet address of your organization. For example, if the
              Internet name of your system is myhost, and the Internet
              address of your organization is smallco.bigcompany.com,
              your cell name, in DCE syntax, would be myhost-
              cell.smallco.bigcompany.com. This convention has the
              following benefits:

              o  The Internet name of your host is unique in your
                 network, so if all DCE users in your network follow
                 this convention, your cell name will also be unique.

              o  It clearly identifies the system on which the writable
                 copy of the root directory of the cell namespace is
                 located.

              o  It does not prohibit intercell communication with
                 outside organizations.

              o  It is easy to remember.

    Configuring a DCE Cell
    4.1 Overview of the DCE Cell


          If there is already a cell name defined in a previously
          existing DCE system configuration, do not change it unless
          you are removing this system from the cell in which it is
          currently a member and you are joining a different cell.

          When the configuration procedure prompts you for the name
          of your DCE cell, type the cell name without the /.../
          prefix; the prefix is added automatically. For example,
          if the full global name selected for the cell, in DCE name
          syntax, is /.../myhost-cell.smallco.bigcompany.com, enter
          myhost-cell.smallco.bigcompany.com.

    4.1.4 Defining a Host Name

          You need to define a name for your system that is unique
          within your DCE cell. You should use the default host
          name, which is the Internet host name (the name specified
          before the first dot(.)). The following example shows
          the default host name derived from the Internet name of
          myhost.mycompany.com.

          Please enter your DCE host name [myhost]:

    4.1.5 Intercell Naming Using DNS

          This section provides tips on defining a cell name in the
          Domain Name System (DNS). Names in DNS are associated with
          one or more data structures called resource records. The
          resource records define cells and are stored in a data
          file. For TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS, this file is called
          SYS$SPECIFIC:[TCPIP$BIND]<domain name>.DB.

          If you are using a UNIX DNS Bind server, it is called
          /etc/namedb/hosts.db. To create a cell entry, you must
          edit the data file and create two resource records for
          each CDS server that maintains a replica of the cell
          namespace root. The following example shows a cell called
          ruby.axpnio.dec.com. The cell belongs to the BIND domain
          axpnio.dec.com. Host alo010.axpnio.dec.com is the master
          CDS server for the ruby.axpnio.dec.com cell. The BIND
          server must be authoritative for the domains of the cell
          name. The BIND master server requires the following entries
          in its data file:

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                TXT records must span only one line. The third entry
                above incorrectly occupies three lines to show the
                information included in the TXT record. You need to do
                whatever is required with your text editor of choice
                to ensure this. Widening your window helps. You should
                also ensure that the quotes are placed correctly and
                that the host name is at the end of the record.

                ______________________________________________________

              The information to the right of the TXT column in the
              Hesiod Text Entry (that is, 1 c8f5f807-48...) comes
              directly from the cdscp show cell /.: as dns command.
              For example, to obtain the information that goes in the
              ruby.axpnio.dec.com text record (TXT), you would go to
              a host in the ruby cell, and enter the cdscp show cell
              /.: as dns command. Then, when the system displays the

        4.1.6 Intercell Naming Using LDAP/X.500

              This section provides tips on defining a cell name in
              LDAP/X500.

              The cells that will communicate using intercell must
              be part of the same LDAP/X500 namespace. This is true
              only if they share a common root in the namespace
              tree. For example, the cells /c=us/o=compaq/ou=laser-
              cell and /c=us/o=compaq/ou=ruby-cell share the root
              /c=us/o=compaq, and would be able to participate in
              intercell communications.

    Configuring a DCE Cell
    4.1 Overview of the DCE Cell


          If your cell is part of an X.500 namespace, answer Yes
          to the question "Do you want to register the DCE cell
          in X.500?". If your cell is part of an LDAP namespace,
          answer Yes to the question "Do you want to register the
          DCE cell in LDAP?". Additional information about Intercell
          operations can be found in Chapter 9 of the Compaq DCE for
          OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Product Guide.

    4.2 The DCE System Configuration Utility - DCE$SETUP.COM

          The DCE$SETUP command procedure begins the configuration
          process. Many of the system configuration utility prompts
          have default values associated with them. The default
          responses are based on your existing configuration, if
          you have one. Otherwise, default values for the most common
          DCE system configurations are provided. At each prompt,
          press RETURN to take the default displayed in brackets,
          type a question mark (?) for help, or supply the requested
          information.

          The system configuration utility sets up the DCE
          environment on your node so that you can use DCE services.
          The system configuration utility leads you through the
          process of creating or joining a cell.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             If you are installing Compaq DCE for OpenVMS VAX or
             OpenVMS Alpha Version 3.0 over a previous version
             of DCE, you do not have to reconfigure DCE after the
             installation. Before the installation, stop the DCE
             daemons with the following command:

             $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP CLEAN

             Then, after the installation, enter the following
             command:

             $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP START

             You must configure if you are installing DCE for the
             first time or reconfigure if you are installing a new
             version over DCE Version 1.0.

                 4.2 The DCE System Configuration Utility - DCE$SETUP.COM


              If you are installing DCE over an existing Compaq DCE for
              OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha, perform the following steps:

              1. Stop the DCE daemons with the following command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP CLEAN

              2. If installing DCE over version 1.5 of Compaq DCE for
                 OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha, also perform the following
                 step to stop the RPC daemon:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$RPC_SHUTDOWN

              3. After the installation, enter the following command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP START

        4.2.1 Configuring LDAP, NSI, and GDA

              The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) provides
              access to the X.500 directory services without the overhead
              of the full Directory Access Protocol (DAP). The simplicity
              of LDAP, along with the powerful capabilities it inherits
              from DAP, makes it the defacto standard for Internet
              directory services and for TCP/IP.

              Inside a cell, a directory service is accessed mostly
              through the name service interface (NSI) implemented
              as part of the run-time library. Cross-cell directory
              service is controlled by a global directory agent (GDA),
              which looks up foreign cell information on behalf of the
              application in either the Domain Naming Service (DNS) or
              X.500 database. Once that information is obtained, the
              application contacts the foreign CDS in the same way as the
              local CDS.

              Once LDAP is configured, applications can request directory
              services from either CDS or LDAP or both. LDAP is provided
              as an optional directory service that is independent of
              CDS and duplicates CDS functionality. LDAP is for customers
              looking for an alternative to CDS that offers TCP/IP and
              Internet support.

              With LDAP directory service available, GDA can look up
              foreign cell information by communicating through LDAP
              to either an LDAP-aware X.500 directory service or a
              standalone LDAP directory service, in addition to DNS and
              DAP.

    Configuring a DCE Cell
    4.2 The DCE System Configuration Utility - DCE$SETUP.COM


          Note that DCE for OpenVMS provides it's own client
          implementation of LDAP. Prior to installing DCE, a DCE
          administrator must obtain LDAP server software and install
          it as an LDAP server in the environment. Next, a DCE
          administrator must choose LDAP during the DCE installation
          and configuration procedure and intentionally configure
          LDAP directory service for a cell.

    4.2.2 Kerberos 5 Security

          The DCE authentication service is based on Kerberos 5. The
          Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) is part of the DCE
          Security Server secd. The authorization information that is
          created by the DCE for OpenVMS privilege server is passed
          in the Kerberos 5 ticket's authorization field.

          DCE provides a Kerberos configuration program
          (DCE$KCFG.EXE) to assist in the interoperability between
          DCE Kerberos and standard Kerberos. To find out more
          information about the kcfg program, use the following two
          commands.

          To display individual command switches and their arguments
          enter:

          kcfg -?

          To display a short description of the command and what it
          does enter:

          kcfg -h

          This provides information on the configuration file
          management, principal registration, and service
          configuration.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             The dcesetup configuration script sets all tickets
             as forwardable, a default value. If tickets are not
             set as forwardable, the Kerberos Distribution Center
             (KDC) server does not provide authentication and
             authorization information to the telnet process. The
             command, kinit -f, marks tickets as forwardable.

                                                   Configuring a DCE Cell
                 4.2 The DCE System Configuration Utility - DCE$SETUP.COM


              All machines within a cell that plan to use Kerberos-
              enabled tools need to check and possibly modify the
              registry and the krb5 configuration with the kcfg
              executable.

              To make sure that Kerberos Version 4 interoperates with
              Kerberos Version 5, an administrator can use the kcfg -k
              command to change krb.conf entries. This command needs to
              be entered on each machine in the cell.

              The registry must contain a principal entry that describes
              the host machine of the KDC server. This principal entry
              is of the form host/<hostname>. The principal and the
              associated keytable entry can be created with kcfg -p. This
              verifies that the host entry exists; if not, it creates the
              host entry.

        4.2.3 Starting the System Configuration Utility

              You must be logged in as a privileged user. The SHOW
              command requires only NETMBX and TMPMBX privileges. All
              other commands require WORLD, SYSPRV, CMKRNL, and SYSNAM
              privileges. The CONFIG command requires BYPASS privileges.

              You can use the same command to perform an initial
              configuration or to reconfigure DCE. See the Appendix
              for several sample configurations. To start the system
              configuration utility, at the DCL prompt enter the
              following command:

              $ @SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP

              The DCE System Management Main Menu appears:

                                                          Configuring DCE


              This chapter explains how to create a cell and configure
              the Security server and CDS server on the same system. It
              also discusses how to configure a client system into an
              existing DCE cell.

        5.1 DCE System Management Command Procedure

              In DCE for OpenVMS Version 3.0, the DCE system management
              command procedure SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP.COM has been
              changed. These changes are described in the following
              sections.

              An RPC only configuration can be started with the startup
              command procedure described in the next section. DCE$SETUP
              stops RPCD during configuration. In DCE for OpenVMS Version
              1.5, DCE$SETUP was modified not to stop RPCD. Changes
              in the DCE daemons required reverting to the previous
              behavior. DCE$SETUP.COM has been rewritten to add the new
              functionality for DCE R1.2.2, and to more closely match the
              configuration program for DCE for Tru64 UNIX.

        5.1.1 Starting and Stopping the RPC Daemon

              The RPC daemon can be started and stopped with the command
              files DCE$RPC_STARTUP.COM and DCE$RPC_SHUTDOWN.COM. These
              files are located in SYS$COMMON:[SYSMGR].

              To start the RPC daemon, execute DCE$RPC_STARTUP.COM. You
              can specify the following option:

         [NO]CONFIRM    Turns user prompting on or off.  CONFIRM is the default.

              To stop the RPC daemon, execute DCE$RPC_SHUTDOWN.COM. You
              can specify the following options in any order:


                                                      Configuring DCE 5-1

 



    Configuring DCE
    5.1 DCE System Management Command Procedure


          [NO]CONFIRM   Turns user prompting on or off.  CONFIRM is the default.
          CLEAN         Deletes all entries from the RPC endpoint database.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Do not stop the RPC daemons if any RPC applications
             are running on the system.

             ______________________________________________________

    5.1.2 Limiting RPC Transports

          The RPC daemon can limit the protocols used by RPC
          applications. To restrict the protocols that can be used,
          set a logical name RPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS to contain the
          valid protocols separated by a colon. Valid protocols
          are ncadg_ip_udp, ncacn_ip_tcp, and ncacn_dnet_nsp. For
          example:

          $ DEFINE RPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS "ncadg_ip_udp:ncacn_ip_tcp"

          This prevents applications and servers from registering
          endpoints that utilize DECnet.

    5.1.3 Logical Names Created During Configuration

          The configuration process creates the following logical
          names:

          ___________________________________________________________
          Logical_Name__________Description__________________________

          DCE                   Defines a search list pointing to

                                and SYS$LIBRARY. These directories
                                contain the Application Developer's
                                Kit include files and other files for

                                    directory is for internal use only.

              DCE$SYSROOT           Points to the directories
                                    DCE$SPECIFIC:, DCE$COMMON:. This
                                    logical is used to find DCE files

              various DCE internal applications).

        5.1.4 Configuring on a VMScluster

              You must configure each node in a VMScluster separately by
              entering the following command on each node:

              To configure a new cell, you must complete the following
              steps:

              1. To begin your initial cell creation and server
                 configuration, invoke the DCE configuration utility.

              2. If you are creating a new cell or adding a CDS server,
                 choose option 6 (Terminate all active DCE daemons and
                 remove all temporary local DCE databases) to stop the
                 DCE daemons in a controlled manner. Be sure to back up

              Option______Description____________________________________

              New Cell    Provides full DCE RPC services, a security
                          registry server for the cell, a CDS master
                          server, a DTS server, and the NSI agent for
                          name service independent access to directory
                          services from PC client systems. There can
                          be only one security registry and CDS master
                          server in a cell, although they need not reside
                          on the same host.

              CDS Server  Provides a DCE client system with a CDS master
                          server added. This option is used if a split
                          server configuration is desired, and the new
                          cell (on another system) was configured without
                          a CDS master server.

              Modify      Provides a submenu of additional configuration
                          options that are available after the initial
                          configuration has completed.

              RPC_Only    Provides a subset of the DCE RPC services.
                          If DCE Version 3.0 is installed on an OpenVMS
                          Alpha system running Version 7.2-1 or higher,
                          NTLM security may be utilized for authenticated
                          RPC requests. With an RPC only configuration,
                          there are no RPC name service interface
                          routines available. This configuration will,
                          however, allow applications to communicate if
                          full string bindings are supplied by the RPC
                          client, or if the client requests the port
                          number to complete the partial string binding
              ____________from_the_end_point_mapper_(DCED_daemon)._______

              4. Choose option 2 to create a new DCE cell.

              5. At each prompt, you can press RETURN to take the default
                 displayed in brackets or enter a question mark (?) for
                 help. When prompted, select a cell name and a host name;
                 the name is used again when you configure DCE client
                 systems.

    Configuring DCE
    5.2 Overview of New Cell Configuration


          6. The configuration utility asks if you want to configure
             the host as a CDS server. Answer Y to configure the
             CDS and security servers on the same system. Answer N
             to perform a split server installation in which you
             configure the security server on the current host and
             the CDS server on a different host.

          7. If you answered Y to configure the CDS and security
             servers on the same system, the utility asks:

        Will there be any DCE pre-R1.1 CDS servers in this cell? (YES/NO/?) [N]:

             If your cell will be running any CDS servers based on
             OSF DCE Release 1.0.3a or lower (equivalent to Compaq
             DCE for OpenVMS Version 1.5 or lower), you should answer
             Y. The configuration utility sets the directory version
             number to 3.0 for compatibility with pre-R1.1 servers.
             This setting disables the use of OSF DCE Release 1.1
             features such as alias cells, CDS delegation ACLs, and
             so on.

             If all CDS servers in your cell will be based on Compaq
             DCE for OpenVMS Version 3.0 (or higher) and based on OSF
             DCE Release 1.1 (or higher), answer N.

             The configuration utility sets the directory version
             number to 4.0 for compatibility with Compaq DCE for
             OpenVMS Version 3.0 CDS servers (OSF DCE Releases
             1.2.2). This enables the use of OSF DCE Release 1.1
             features such as alias cells, CDS delegation ACLs, and
             so on, and OSF DCE Release 1.2.2 features. Once the
             directory version is set to 4.0, you cannot set it back
             to 3.0.

          8. You are prompted to confirm the system time; it is
             important that you check the current time before you
             respond.

          9. The configuration utility will prompt for the Domain
             Name and DNS server address.

         10. If DECnet/OSI is installed on your system, the
             configuration utility displays the following message
             and then asks several questions about configuring a DCE
             Distributed Time Service server on your system.

                                   5.2 Overview of New Cell Configuration


           You seem to have DECnet/OSI installed on this system. DECnet/OSI
           includes a distributed time synchronization service (DECdts), which
           does not currently support the DCE Distributed Time Service (DCE DTS)
           functionality. The DCE DTS in this release provides full DECdts
           functionality. This installation will stop DECdts and use DCE DTS
           instead. For further clarification, please consult the Compaq DCE
           for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Product Guide.

               Even though DCE DTS will be used, it is possible to
               accept time from DECdts servers.

               Should this node accept time from DECdts servers? (YES/NO/?) [N]:

               Do you want this system to be a DTS Server (YES/NO/?) [Y]:

               Do you want this system to be a DTS Global Server (YES/NO/?) [N]:

               Does this cell use multiple LANs? (YES/NO/?) [N]:

               Answer the questions appropriately.

             11. The configuration utility asks if you want to run the
                 MIT Kerberos 5 services on this machine. A Y answer runs
                 the configuration utility.

   Do you intend to run MIT Kerberos 5 services on this machine? (YES/NO/?)  [N]

             12. The configuration utility asks if you want to configure
                 the LDAP name service on this system. A yes answer
                 prompts the question, "Do you want to configure the
                 system as an LDAP client?" and requires that you enter
                 further information regarding LDAP services.

                 Do you want to configure the LDAP name service? (YES/NO/?) [N]:

             13. The configuration utility asks if you want to configure
                 gdad to use LDAP. (gdad is the daemon for Global
                 Directory Agent.)

                 Do you want to configure gdad to use LDAP? (YES/NO/?) [N]:

             14. Next, the screen displays your selections and asks
                 whether to save them as your DCE system configuration.
                 Answer Y.

             15. All previous temporary and permanent DCE databases and
                 configuration files are now removed prior to starting
                 the new configuration.

         16. The configuration utility asks you to enter some random
             keystrokes in order to supply a keyseed for the security
             server.

                 **************************************************************
                 *  Starting the security server requires that you supply     * 
                 *  a `keyseed.'  When asked for a `keyseed,' type some       * 
                 *  random, alphanumeric keystrokes, followed by RETURN.      *
                 *  (You won't be required to remember what you type.)        * 
                 **************************************************************

                 Enter keyseed for initial database master key:

         17. The configuration utility asks you to enter the password
             for the cell_admin account, and asks for confirmation.

             Please type new password for cell_admin (or `?' for help):

             Type again to confirm:

         18. The DCE daemons are started and configuration
             information is set up. After the dts daemon is
             started, you are prompted to run the DCE Configuration
             Verification Program (CVP). Press RETURN to start the
             CVP.

         19. To verify that all requested services are configured,
             choose option 2 (Show DCE configuration and active
             daemons) from the DCE Setup Main Menu. The screen
             displays all configured DCE services and active DCE
             daemons.

          You have completed creating a cell.

    5.3 Configuring Your System as a DCE Client with Run-Time
        Services

          If you want to add your system to an existing cell, choose
          option 1 (Configure this system as a DCE Client) from the
          Configuration Choice Menu. This option configures the run-
          time services subset on your system.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             During the initial DCE client configuration, the
             client software may have problems locating the Cell
             Directory Service server if the Internet protocol
             netmask for your client machine is not consistent

                ______________________________________________________

              When you choose option 1, the procedure displays the
              following messages:

              The configuration utility asks whether to search the LAN
              for known cells within the broadcast range of your system.

               Would you like to search the LAN for known cells? (YES/NO/?) [Y]:

              If you know the name of your DCE cell, answer N. As
              prompted, supply the name of your DCE cell, your DCE host
              name, and the host name of your cell's master CDS server.
              You also need to specify whether your host can broadcast to
              the host where the master CDS server is installed.

              Answer Y to see a list of available DCE cells. As prompted,
              supply your DCE host name. At the next prompt, supply the
              appropriate DCE cell name from the list.

              and then asks several questions about configuring a DCE
              Distributed Time Service server on your system.

           You seem to have DECnet/OSI installed on this system. DECnet/OSI
           includes a distributed time synchronization service (DECdts), which
           does not currently support the DCE Distributed Time Service (DCE DTS)
           functionality. The DCE DTS in this release provides full DECdts

           instead.  For further clarification, please consult the Compaq DCE
           for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Product Guide.

              Even though DCE DTS will be used, it is possible to accept
              time from DECdts servers.

               Should this node accept time from DECdts servers? (YES/NO/?) [N]:

              Answer Y to accept time from any DECnet/OSI DECdts server;
              however, time from this source is unauthenticated. If
              you answer N, this system accepts time only from DCE time
              servers.

              If DECnet/OSI is not installed on your system, the
              configuration utility omits the previous DECdts questions
              and instead, asks:

              Answer Y to configure the host as a DTS client.

              The configuration utility asks if you want to run the MIT
              Kerberos 5 services on this machine. An answer of Y runs
              the configuration utility.

        5.4 Split Server Configuration (Adding a Master CDS Server)

              This section discusses a split server installation in which
              a new cell and the master Security Server are created
              on one system and the master CDS Server is configured on
              another system. The master CDS Server maintains the master
              replica of the cell root directory.

              A split server configuration has four phases:

              o  Begin creating the new cell and master Security Server
                 on one system.

              o  Begin creating the master CDS Server on another system.

              o  Complete creating the new cell and master Security on
                 the first system.

              o  Complete creating the master CDS Server on the second
                 system.

        5.4.1 Creating a New Cell and Master Security Server

              This is the first phase of a split server configuration.
              Begin this phase by creating the new cell on the machine
              where the master security server will reside. Choose option
              2 (Create a new DCE cell) from the Configuration Choice
              Menu. Answer the prompts appropriately for the cell name
              and host name. Then answer N at the following prompt:

              Do you wish to configure myhost as a CDS server? (YES/NO/?) [Y]: N

          Proceed through the rest of the configuration answering the
          remaining questions as shown in section 5.1, until you get
          to the following:

          *********************************************************************
          * This system has now been configured as a security server.         *

          * press the <RETURN> key to continue configuring this system.       *
          *********************************************************************

          Go to the machine where you will configure the master CDS
          Server.

    5.4.2 Creating a Master CDS Server on Another System

          This is the second phase of a split server configuration.
          You must have created a new cell and begun configuring the
          security server on another machine. Log on to the system on
          which you want to install the CDS master server, and choose
          option 3 (Add Master CDS Server) from the Configuration
          Choice Menu.

          Answer the following prompts:

              Please enter the name of your DCE cell []:

              Please enter your DCE hostname [myhost2]:

          The procedure asks:
 
        Will there be any DCE pre-R1.1 CDS servers in this cell? (YES/NO/?) [N]:

          If your cell will be running any CDS servers based on OSF
          DCE Release 1.0.3a or lower, you should answer Y. The
          configuration utility sets the directory version number
          to 3.0 for compatibility with pre-R1.1 servers. This
          disables the use of OSF DCE Release 1.1 features such as
          alias cells, CDS delegation ACLs, and so on.

          If all CDS servers in your cell will be based on DCE for
          OpenVMS Version 3.0 or higher (or an equivalent DCE version
          based on OSF DCE Release 1.1 or higher) answer N. The
          configuration utility sets the directory version number
          to 4.0 for compatibility with DCE for OpenVMS (Version

              3.0 or OSF DCE Release 1.1 or higher) CDS servers. This
              enables the use of OSF DCE Release 1.1 features such as
              alias cells, CDS delegation ACLs, and so on. Once the
              directory version is set to 4.0, you cannot set it back
              to 3.0.

              The procedure configures accordingly and prompts you to
              enter the host name of the security server that you just
              configured.

                  What is the hostname of the Security Server for this cell? []:

              The configuration procedure continues, and requests
              additional client information as described in section 5.2.
              The procedure configures the requested services, and then
              prompts you to complete the configuration of the security
              server on the other machine before continuing:

               ****************************************************************
               * This system has now been configured as the Master CDS Server. *
               *                                                               *

                  Press <RETURN> to continue:

              Return to the system on which you configured the security
              server.

        5.4.3 Completing the Security Server Configuration

              This is the third phase of a split server configuration.
              You must have created a new cell and begun configuring the
              Security Server on one machine. Then you created a master
              CDS Server on another machine. Now you will complete the
              Security Server configuration on the first machine.

              Return to the system on which you configured the Security
              Server and press the RETURN key. The following prompt is
              displayed:

              What is the hostname of the Master CDS Server for this cell [ ]:

              The configuration procedure proceeds as described in the
              section Overview of New Cell Configuration.

    5.4 Split Server Configuration (Adding a Master CDS Server)


          Once the Security Server configuration is complete, return
          to the host on which you are configuring the master CDS
          Server and complete the installation.

    5.4.4 Completing the CDS Master Server Configuration

          This is the fourth and final phase of a split server
          configuration. You must have created a new cell and
          begun configuring the security server on one machine.
          Then you created a master CDS server on another machine.
          You completed the security server configuration on the
          first machine. Now you will complete the CDS master server
          configuration.

          Completion of this phase consists of running the
          configuration verification program:
 
  Do you want to run the DCE Configuration Verification Program? (YES/NO/?) [Y]:

          You can run the CVP now by answering Y, or you can run the
          CVP at a later time by answering N. The procedure completes
          the configuration and returns to the DCE Setup Main Menu.
          Choose option 2 (Show DCE configuration and active daemons)
          from the DCE Setup Main Menu to verify your configuration
          choices.

    5.5 Migrating Your Cell

          Some DCE cells may be running security or CDS servers on
          hosts with different versions of DCE. This might happen
          because a cell has DCE software from multiple vendors, each
          supplying upgrades at different times. Or perhaps upgrading
          all the hosts simultaneously is not feasible.

          DCE for OpenVMS Version 3.0 security servers and CDS
          servers can interoperate with older servers (based on OSF
          DCE Release 1.0.3a, 1.0.2, and so on). However, new DCE
          security features associated with OSF DCE Release 1.1 and
          DCE Release 1.2.2 will generally not be available until all
          security server replicas in your cell are based on OSF DCE
          Release 1.1 and 1.2.2. Additionally, new CDS capabilities
          will not be available until all security servers and some
          or all CDS servers are based on OSF DCE Release 1.1 and
          1.2.2.

                                                  5.5 Migrating Your Cell


              If your cell contains older versions of Security or CDS
              Servers, you will need to migrate (gradually upgrade) older
              servers until all of them are running DCE server software
              based on OSF DCE Release 1.1 and 1.2.2. Once all Security
              or CDS Servers have been upgraded, you must perform some
              additional steps so that your servers can provide the new
              security and CDS capabilities.

              Security Servers and CDS Servers use separate procedures
              to complete migration. Security Migration provides the
              instructions for completing Security server migration.
              CDS migration provides the instructions for completing CDS
              Server migration.

        5.5.1 Security Migration

              After you install the new security server version on a host
              where an older version security replica (master or slave)
              exists, that replica will operate with the new Security
              Server, but with the behavior of the older version server.
              Note that a server based on OSF DCE 1.1 or higher cannot
              create a new replica and operate it as an older version
              replica. Once OSF DCE Release 1.1 has been installed on
              all hosts that have security replicas, you must issue a
              single cell-wide command that simultaneously migrates all
              the replicas to operate at the level of DCE 1.1. At this
              point the cell will support new security features such as
              extended registry attributes.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Once you have migrated the security servers to DCE 1.1
                or higher, it is not possible to create a replica on a
                host running an earlier version.

                ______________________________________________________

              If all of the Security Server replicas in your cell are
              based on OSF DCE Release 1.1, you can perform the final
              migration steps in this section.

              If your cell is still running any Security Servers based on
              a DCE release prior to OSF DCE Release 1.1, do not complete
              the upgrade steps in this section. The upgrade steps will
              advance some security database attributes. Older servers
              cannot operate on newer version databases.

    5.5 Migrating Your Cell


          Once you have installed and configured DCE for OpenVMS
          Version 3.0 Security Servers in your cell, perform the
          following actions as cell administrator:

          1. Ensure that at lease one security replica can write to
             the cell profile. Use the following operation to check
             the cell-profile ACL for: user:dce-rgy:rw-t---.

                 $ dcecp -c acl show -io /.:/cell_profile

          2. On all Security Servers, set the server version to:
             secd.dce.1.1.

                 $ dcecp -c registry modify -version secd.dce.1.1

          3. Verify that the version has been set to secd.dce.1.1.

                 $ dcecp -c registry show

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             If you have not updated all 1.0.3 security replicas to
             DCE 1.1, any original 1.0.3 replicas will be stopped
             when you move the registry version forward to DCE
             1.1. You may want to verify that any original 1.0.3
             replicas are no longer running.

    5.5.2 CDS Migration

          If you have installed and configured DCE for OpenVMS
          Version 3.0 CDS servers in your cell, you might need to
          perform additional steps to complete the upgrade process.

          If you created a new DCE cell and, during the dcesetup
          process, you set the default directory version information
          for each CDS server to Version 4.0, you do not need to
          perform the migration steps in this section.

          If your cell is still running any security or CDS servers
          based on a DCE release prior to OSF DCE Release 1.1, do
          not complete the upgrade steps in this section. The upgrade
          steps will advance some security database and CDS directory
          attributes. Older servers cannot operate on newer version
          databases or directories.

              DCE for OpenVMS Version 3.0 (or equivalent) features, such
              as hierarchical cells and alias cells, will be available
              only when all of your cell's security and CDS servers
              are running DCE for OpenVMS Version 3.0 or higher and the
              upgrade steps have been completed. Refer to the DCE for
              OpenVMS Product Guide and to the OSF DCE documentation for
              descriptions of available features.

              Once the necessary DCE servers have been upgraded to DCE
              software based on OSF DCE Release 1.1 or 1.2.2, you can
              perform the migration steps in this section. The migration
              steps will enable the use of hierarchical cells, alias
              cells, and delegation.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Directory version information can only be set forward.
                If you migrate a CDS server to OSF DCE 1.1 or 1.2.2
                behavior, you cannot revert that server to 1.0.3
                behavior.

                ______________________________________________________

              Once you have installed and configured DCE for OpenVMS
              Version 3.0 (or equivalent) security servers and
              CDS servers, perform the following actions as cell
              administrator:

              1. If you have not done so, perform the security migration
                 steps in Security Migration.

              2. For all CDS clearinghouses, manually update the
                 CDS_UpgradeTo attribute to 4.0. The following two
                 operations ensure that new directories created in this
                 clearinghouse will receive the correct directory version
                 number:

              $ dcecp -c clearinghouse modify chname -add \{CDS_UpgradeTo 4.0 \}
              $ dcecp -c clearinghouse verify chname

              3. Manually upgrade all older directory version information
                 to 4.0 as follows:

                 $ dcecp -c directory modify /.: -upgrade -tree

    Configuring DCE
    5.5 Migrating Your Cell


          The -tree option operates recursively on all subdirectories
          (in this example, it operates on the entire cell). This
          command does not work unless all CDS servers housing the
          affected directories are running DCE for OpenVMS Version
          3.0. This command can take a long time to execute depending
          on the size of the namespace.

    5.6 Running the DCE Configuration Verification Program

          Once the DCE daemons are started, you can run the DCE
          Configuration Verification Program (CVP) to ensure that
          the DCE services are properly installed. The procedure
          prompts you with the following message:

   Do you want to run the DCE Configuration Verification Program? (YES/NO/?)[Y]:

          If you enter Y or press RETURN, the procedure indicates
          that the CVP is running.

          The CVP invokes tests of the 10 DCE RPC interfaces,
          printing a dot (.) as each test is successful. A completely
          successful test execution results in 10 dots printed in
          succession. When the CVP tests are completed successfully,
          you receive the following message:

                ______________________________________________________

              After you run the CVP, the configuration procedure updates
              your system startup procedure so that the daemons restart
              automatically whenever the system is rebooted.

        5.7 Error Recovery During Configuration

              If the procedure encounters any errors during DCE system
              configuration, it displays error messages. Some errors are
              not fatal, and the procedure attempts to continue. Other
              errors are fatal, and the procedure terminates. If a fatal
              error is encountered while the procedure is starting the
              DCE daemons, the procedure attempts to stop any daemons
              that have already been started. This returns the system to
              its original state before you began the configuration.

              If you receive an error message at any time while
              running the DCE System Configuration utility, you
              can get more detailed information about the cause of
              the error by examining the associated log file in
              SYS$MANAGER:DCE$SETUP.LOG. This log file contains a record
              of the operations invoked by the System Configuration
              utility the last time it was executed, and may help you
              diagnose the cause of the problem.

              Sometimes the cause of an error is transitory and may not
              recur if you repeat the operation.

              no prior configuration.

              Choose option 1 (Add Replica CDS Server) from the Modify
              Configuration Menu. The configuration utility asks whether
              to search the LAN for known cells within broadcast range of

              prompted, supply the name of your DCE cell, your DCE host
              name, and the host name of your cell's master CDS server.
              You also need to specify whether your host can broadcast to
              the host where the master CDS server is installed.

                  Is this time correct? (y/n):

              Please check the time before you respond to this prompt.

              Make sure you check that the correct time is displayed

              After you correct or verify the time, answer Y, and the
              procedure continues with the following message (if you have
              DECnet/OSI installed and configured):

           You seem to have DECnet/OSI installed on this system. DECnet/OSI
           includes a distributed time synchronization service (DECdts), which
           does not currently support the DCE Distributed Time Service (DCE DTS)
           functionality. The DCE DTS in this release provides full DECdts
           functionality. This installation will stop DECdts and use DCE DTS
           instead. For further clarification, please consult the Compaq DCE
           for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Product Guide.

              Even though DCE DTS will be used, it is possible to accept
              time from DECdts servers.

               Should this node accept time from DECdts servers? (YES/NO/?) [N]:

              Answer Y to accept time from any DECnet/OSI DECdts server;
              however, time from this source is unauthenticated. If
              you answer N, this system accepts time only from DCE DTS
              servers.

                Do you want this system to be a DTS Local Server (YES/NO/?) [N]:

              If DECnet/OSI is not installed, this system must be
              configured as either a DTS clerk or a DTS server. For a
              complete description on the differences between DTS clerks

    6.2 Adding a Replica CDS Server


          When configuring the CDS server, the procedure asks:

              What is the name for this clearinghouse? [myhost_ch]:

          Specify a name for this clearinghouse that is unique in
          this cell. The procedure displays the following messages
          and asks whether you want to replicate more directories.

              Do you wish to replicate more directories? (YES/NO/?):

          The root directory from the CDS master server has just been
          replicated. You can replicate more directories if you want
          by answering Y. Next, you are prompted for the name of a
          CDS directory to be replicated.

              Enter the name of a CDS directory to be replicated:

          Enter the name of a CDS directory existing in the master
          CDS namespace that you want to replicate on this system.
          Type the directory name without the /.:/ prefix; it is
          added automatically. When you are finished, press only the
          RETURN key. The procedure displays the following messages
          and asks whether you want to run the CVP.

          If your system is already configured as a CDS Replica
          Server, this option will show "Remove Replica CDS Server"
          on the Modify Configuration Menu.

          Choose this option if you want to remove a CDS Replica
          Server from your DCE configuration. You will not affect the
          rest of your system's DCE configuration.

    6.3 Adding a Security Replica

          If you want to add a replica security server to your
          system, choose option 2 (Add Replica Security Server) from
          the Modify Configuration Menu. When you choose this option,
          the procedure will configure the system as a DCE client

    6.4 Adding/Removing a DTS Local Server

          If you want to add a DTS server to your machine, you can
          do so on a system that has already been configured as a
          client, or on a system that has not yet been configured for
          DCE. Choose option 3 (Add DTS Local Server) from the Modify
          Configuration Menu.

          If the system has not yet been configured for DCE, it will
          be configured as a DCE client.

          Also choose option 3 if you want to modify your
          configuration from a DTS Local Server to a DTS clerk. This
          operation does not affect the rest of your system's DCE
          configuration.

    6.5 Adding a DTS Global Server

          If you want to add a DTS Global Server to your system,
          choose option 4 (Add DTS Global Server) from the Modify
          Configuration Menu.

          If your system is already configured as a DTS Global
          Server, option 4 shows Change from DTS Global Server to
          DTS Clerk. Choose this option if you want to modify your
          configuration from a DTS Global Server to a DTS Clerk.

          When the procedure is completed, the Modify Configuration
          Menu is displayed again.

    6.6 Adding a Null Time Provider

          The null time provider allows DTS to set the inaccuracy
          without setting the time or in any way modifying the host
          system time. Refer to the OSF DCE Administration Guide
          - Core Components volume for further information about
          getting time from Network Time Protocol (NTP) time sources.

          If you want to add a null time provider to your system,
          choose option 5 (Add Null Time Provider) from the Modify
          Configuration Menu.

              Press RETURN. When the procedure is completed, the Modify
              Configuration Menu is displayed again.

        6.7 Adding an NTP Time Provider

              If your site uses Network Time Protocol (NTP) to set system
              time, you can use those time signals to synchronize DTS.
              Briefly, one DTS server uses the NTP time provider software
              to synchronize with NTP. That DTS server synchronizes with
              other DTS servers using DTS time signals. Refer to the
              OSF DCE Administration Guide - Core Components volume
              for further information about getting time from NTP time
              sources.

              If you want to add an NTP time provider to your system,
              choose option 6 (Add NTP Time Provider) from the Modify
              Configuration Menu.

              The configuration adds and starts the null time provider,
              displaying the following messages:

                      Starting NTP Time Provider (dts_ntp_provider)...

         Enter the hostname where the NTP server is running: dcedts.lkg.dec.com

              Press RETURN. When the procedure is completed, the Modify
              Configuration Menu is displayed again.

        6.8 Enabling Auditing

              DCE auditing facilities detect and record critical events
              in distributed applications. To enable DCE auditing
              facilities on your machine, choose option 7 (Enable
              Auditing) from the Modify Configuration Menu.

              The procedure begins configuring the Audit daemon and
              prompts you to log in to the cell.

    6.9 Enabling DCE Integrated Login

          If you want users to have the ability to obtain DCE
          credentials when they interactively log in to OpenVMS,
          and to automatically synchronize DCE and OpenVMS passwords,
          then choose option 8 from the Modify Configuration Menu.
          For more information on DCE Integrated Login, see the
          Compaq DCE for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Product Guide.

          If DCE Integrated Login was previously enabled on your

        6.11 Configuring the LDAP Name Service

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                You will need a working LDAP server somewhere on your
                network to configure DCE to use LDAP. Consult your
                LDAP documentation for information on terminology and
                setting up an LDAP server.

                ______________________________________________________

              Configuring the LDAP name service involves three steps
              on the Modify Configuration Menu. Here, the first step
              defines to the system the extent of potential additional
              capabilities. If fully configured, LDAP provides a second
              path to access the X.500 directory service, requires less
              overhead than DAP, and provides support for the TCP/IP
              protocol.

              Choose option 10 to add the LDAP name service to the
              configuration.

              Next, to configure the LDAP name service, specify the
              location of the LDAP server and the distinguished name
              (DN) of your DCE cell as it appears in the LDAP name space.

              You are prompted for necessary information in the following
              script. You can press '?' at the prompt for help.

              Press <RETURN> to continue:

          When the procedure is completed, the Modify Configuration
          Menu is displayed again.

    6.12 Adding LDAP Client Service

          The LDAP Client Service option adds or removes host-
          specific information in the LDAP namespace; that is, to
          create server, group, and profile entries for LDAP like
          those entries that are used in CDS during the DCE client
          configuration. Examples of such entries include everything
          under /.:/hosts/HOST_NAME.

          Choose option 11 to configure LDAP Client Service. When the
          procedure is completed, the Modify Configuration Menu is
          displayed again.

    6.13 Configuring LDAP Support for the Global Directory Assistant

          After enabling LDAP and adding LDAP Client Service, it is
          necessary to connect LDAP to the global directory agent
          (GDA). Cross-cell directory service is controlled by a GDA,
          which looks up foreign cell information on behalf of the
          application in either the Domain Naming Service (DNS) or
          X.500 database. Applications can request directory services

        6.14 Registering a Cell in X.500

              To search for destinations in other cells requires
              connection with a directory service database. All cross-
              cell directory name searches are controlled by the global
              directory agent (GDA), which looks up foreign cell
              information on behalf of an application in either the
              Domain Naming Service (DNS) or X.500 database.

              Choose option 13 to set up communications between your
              configured cell and the X.500 directory service.

                  Please enter the object class for cell :

          Every entry in X.500 is classified according to the
          characteristics of the real world object that it
          represents. Before the cell entry can be created in the
          X.500 directory, you must specify the class of the entry.

          For example, if you choose option 1, the organizational
          unit class is specified.

          The superior entries must exist before the cell entry can
          be created. In the above example, c=mycountry/o=mycompany
          must exist prior to choosing the cell registration option.

          If the cell entry exists, you are asked to confirm if the
          cell attribute information needs to be replaced.

          COMPAQ cell registration, which is compatible with OSF DCE
          GDS, saves the cell information in special CDS-Cell and

              This appendix provides a listing for the installation of
              Compaq DCE for OpenVMS Version 3.0 on OpenVMS Alpha.

        B.1 Installing Compaq DCE on OpenVMS Alpha

              This installation has the following assumptions:

              o  OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2 or higher was installed.

              o  Both the Runtime Services Kit (RTK) and the Application
                 Developer's Kit (ADK) are being installed.

              o  The ADK license PAK was loaded already.

              o  Either UCX Version 4.2 or TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS
                 Version 5.0 (or higher), and DECnet Phase IV or DECnet
                 Phase V were installed.

              o  The DCE$SERVER account exists already.

              o  The NET$DECLAREOBJECT right has not yet been granted
                 to DCE$SERVER; it will be granted by the installation
                 procedure.

              $ @dka500:[dceaxp030]dce$install help

                      Performing DCE pre-installation tasks...please wait.

          This installation procedure has detected an existing DCE$SERVER
          account. Correct operation of DCE on this system requires that the
          DCE$SERVER account have TMPMBX, NETMBX, DETACH, and SYSPRV privileges.

         The installation procedure will modify the DCE$SERVER account to ensure
              that the prerequisite privileges are present.

          DEC AXPVMS DCE V3.0: DCE V3.0 for OpenVMS Alpha

          Greetings!

          This is DCE V3.0 for OpenVMS Alpha.
          There are four components: the DCE Runtime Services, the
          DCE Application Development Kit, the DCE Security Server,
          and the DCE CDS Server.

               1. The Runtime Services provides the core services necessary to
                  execute and manage DCE applications.

               2. The Application Development Kit provides the services and 
                  tools required to develop, execute, and manage DCE 
                  applications. The Runtime Services capability is 
                  automatically provided with the Application Development Kit.

               3. The security server supplies support for a cell wide security
                  database. A cell must have at least one system running a 
                  security server.

               4. The CDS server supplies support for a cell wide naming 
            database. A cell must have at least one system running a CDS server.
