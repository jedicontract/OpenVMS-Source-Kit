          LICENSE INFORMATION

          If you are installing the Compaq DCE for OpenVMS Runtime Ser-
          vices Kit, you do not need a separate license. The right to
          use the Runtime Services Kit is included as part of the OpenVMS
          operating license.

          However, if you are installing the Compaq DCE for OpenVMS Ap-
          plication Developer's Kit, CDS Server Kit, or Security Server
          Kit, you must first register a License Product Authorization Key
          (License PAK) using the License Management Facility (LMF). The
          License PAK can be shipped along with the kit if you ordered the
          license and media together; otherwise, it is shipped separately
          to a location based on your license order. If you are installing
          Compaq DCE for OpenVMS as an update on a node or cluster al-
          ready licensed for this software, you have already completed the
          License PAK registration requirements. See the OpenVMS License
          Management Utility Manual for registration instructions.

 






          The DCE Privacy kit has been retired, and that functionality
          has been combined into the base DCE kit. You now can use packet
          level privacy without a separate kit or license.
