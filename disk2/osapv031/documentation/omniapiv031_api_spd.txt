PRODUCT NAME:    Compaq OSAP/AP Version 3.1            SPD 47.96.07
                (Compaq OMNI Services for SINEC Automa-
                tion Protocols/SINEC AP Services)

DESCRIPTION

Compaq OSAP/AP is a network communication product. It provides a so-
lution to connect Compaq applications with shop floor devices based
on Siemens® SINEC® Automation Protocol (AP) communication protocol.
Although mainly oriented to the manufacturing environment, SINEC AP
addresses generic applications and is intended to provide a common com-
munication method between different Siemens automation devices- Pro-
grammable Logic Controllers (PLCs), numeric control machines, robots,
personal computers and minicomputers.

Siemens SINEC AP is layered on top of the SINEC H1 network and pro-
vides proprietary Session, Presentation, and Application layers. The
result offers an integrated Siemens Level 1 solution with an associ-
ated value of a consistent and uniform view to the plant floor appli-
cations.

Compaq OSAP/AP fully supports the SINEC AP communication protocol.

Features

Compaq OSAP/AP provides the support for SINEC AP Application, Presen-
tation, and Session layers. As this communication protocol is defined
on top of the ISO OSI Transport Layer, Compaq OSAP/AP relies upon Com-
paq DECnet/OSI to complete the communication stack. For more infor-
mation, refer to the DECnet/OSI Software Product Description (SPD 41.92.xx)




                              COMPAQ                   April 2000

 

Because of the functional compatibility between Siemens SINEC AP and
MMS (Manufacturing Messaging Services), ISO International Standard 9506,
Parts 1 and 2, Compaq OSAP is integrated with the software architec-
ture of the Compaq OMNI API product to supply the Application Program-
ming Interface (API). For more information, refer to the Compaq OMNI
API Software Product Description (SPD 47.88.xx).
