PRODUCT NAME:    Compaq OSAP/H1 Version 3.1            SPD 47.95.06
                (Compaq OMNI Services for SINEC Automa-
                tion Protocols/SINEC H1 Services)

DESCRIPTION

Compaq OSAP is a network communication product. It provides a solu-
tion to connect Compaq applications with shop floor devices based on
Siemens® SINEC® H1 communication protocol. SINEC H1 services are also
identified as PG communication services in Siemens literature.

Siemens SINEC H1 has been recommended for connecting PLCs and host com-
puters on large configurations. It has been specified on top of the
ISO/OSI Transport Layer and it is based on Ethernet to improve effec-
tiveness (through higher performance) and efficiency (through lower
costs per connection).

Compaq OSAP/H1 fully supports the SINEC H1 communication protocol.

Features

As the SINEC H1 communication protocol is defined on top of the ISO
OSI Transport Layer, Compaq OSAP relies upon Compaq DECnet/OSI to com-
plete the communication stack. For more information, refer to the DEC-
net/OSI Software Product Description (SPD 41.92.xx).

Because of the functional compatibility between Siemens SINEC AP and
MMS (Manufacturing Messaging Services), ISO International Standard 9506,
Parts 1 and 2, Compaq OSAP is integrated with the software architec-
ture of the Compaq OMNI API product to supply the Application Program-
ming Interface (API). For more information, refer to the Compaq OMNI
API Software Product Description (SPD 47.88.xx).

Compaq OSAP also provides Device Access Software (DAS) for connect-
ing Siemens SINEC H1 devices for BASEstar Open Server systems. For fur-
ther information, refer to the Compaq OMNI API Software Product De-
scription (SPD 47.82.xx).
