              This chapter discusses the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing Compaq TP Desktop Connector and
              Compaq TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS software
              on an OpenVMS system from the Software Products Library
              CD. This chapter also provides a general overview of the
              installation process.

              If you have the TPware Product Suite or TP Desktop
              Connector Gateway for ACMS CD, see Part II or III,
              respectively.

              TP Desktop Connector software includes online Release
              Notes and gives you the option of printing or displaying
              them during the installation procedure. Compaq strongly
              recommends that you read the Release Notes before
              proceeding with the installation, in case they contain
              important information regarding the installation
              procedure.

        1.1 Overview of the Software Products Library Installation

              The TP Desktop Connector software is delivered in two
              distinct product savesets, one for the gateway software
              that run on the OpenVMS platform and one for desktop
              clients:

              o  The gateway saveset (ACMSDIA031.*)

                 Delivers the software required on an OpenVMS system to
                 enable access to Compaq ACMS from the desktop systems.
                 Also includes server-side sample applications.

                 You install the gateway software with a regular
                 VMSINSTAL command.

              o  The client saveset (TPWA031.A)

              Delivers the software required for application
              development in a multiplatform, networked, desktop
              systems environment. Also includes sample client
              applications.

              You install the client software by starting with a
              VMSINSTAL command on an OpenVMS system. The next steps
              depend on your target desktop platform.

           The clients are provided as self-extracting archive files
           that expand upon execution. In general, the procedure for
           installing the client software and accompanying sample
           client application files consists of the following steps:

           1. Transfer a client archive file to your target desktop
              platform, using a file transfer program such as FTP.

           2. Expand the archive file by executing it.

           3. If your target desktop is a Win32 system, run the
              resulting setup.exe file as explained in Section 5.1.

              If your target desktop is non-Win32:

              a. Set up your system for the TP Desktop Connector
                 environment.

              b. Set up your network transport.

              These steps are explained in Section 5.2.

              If your target desktop is an Apple Macintosh, see
              Chapter 7

           4. Run the sample application to verify that the
              installation functions properly.

           The following sections discuss the preparations and
           requirements necessary before installing the TP Desktop
           Connector software.

     1.2 Software and Hardware Prerequisites

           The Compaq TP Desktop Connector Software Product
           Description (SPD), included in the product kit, contains
           complete information on software products, networks,
           and systems required for installing and using TP Desktop
           Connector client and gateway software.

        1.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

              Both the gateway and client installations from the
              Software Products Library CD use the VMSINSTAL command
              (see Section 2.1 and Chapter 8 for gateway and server-
              side instructions). Section 2.2 describes the client
              installation process.

           Instructions for VMSINSTAL are in Chapter 9.

     2.2 Installing the Client Kit

           To install the client kit on the OpenVMS system, while
           logged in under the SYSTEM account at the DCL prompt, type
           a command in the following format:

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL TPWA031 device-name:[directory-name]

           The value of device-name: is the specification of the
           drive on which the CD-ROM is mounted and directory-name
           is the location of the product saveset on the library CD
           (refer to the Software Products Library Master Index for
           the directory name). Example 2-1 shows the output from a

                                                                       3
        ________________________________________________________________

                  After Installing from the Software Products Library CD



              This chapter describes the procedures, on both the OpenVMS
              system where the gateway kit was installed and on your
              target desktop system, that are required for server-side
              and client-side applications to run and communicate.

        3.1 After Installing the Gateway Kit

              Post-installation tasks for TP Desktop Connector Gateway
              for ACMS software are the same whether you install from
              the Software Products Library CD or the TPware Product
              Suite CD (see Chapter 10).

              For TP Desktop Connector on the Software Products Library,
              the server-side sample application is part of the client
              kit, not the gateway kit. The client services files
              for OpenVMS are laid down when you use VMSINSTAL on the
              TPWA031 savesets. See Section 3.3 for information on the
              server-side Avertz sample application.

        3.2 After Installing TP Desktop Connector Client Kit

              After installing the client kit from the Software Products
              Library CD, all the files needed for OpenVMS client and
              sample applications are in place. If you are developing an
              OpenVMS client application, you should edit a startup file
              as shown in Section 3.2.1. If you are developing a client
              application for a different desktop platform, you should
              follow Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.







              After Installing from the Software Products Library CD 3-1

 






     3.2.1 Editing Startup Files

           If TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS is already
           installed on the same system, edit the gateway startup
           file, SYS$STARTUP:ACMSDI$STARTUP.COM. Remove the comment
           character (!)  from the following logical name definitions
           for the client directories:

     $! The next three logical name definitions pertain to TP Desktop Connector
     $! client libraries and Motif samples and should be defined only after installing
     $! clients on the same system where the Gateway is installed.
     $!
     $! define/system acmsdi$vms sys$common:[acmsdi.vms_clients]
     $! define/system acmsdi$nonvms_clients sys$common:[acmsdi.nonvms_clients]
     $! define/system acmsdi$examples_avertz_motif -
     $!               sys$common:[syshlp.examples.acmsdi.avertz.motif]

           If the gateway is on a different system, add the following
           logical name definitions to your system startup file:

     $ define/system acmsdi$vms sys$common:[acmsdi.vms_clients]
     $ define/system acmsdi$nonvms_clients sys$common:[acmsdi.nonvms_clients]
     $ define/system acmsdi$examples_avertz_motif -
                     sys$common:[syshlp.examples.acmsdi.avertz.motif]

     3.2.2 After Installing Non-VMS Clients

           In addition to OpenVMS client libraries, the client
           installation loads the self-extracting archive files on
           your OpenVMS system (see Table 3-1). (The logical name
           ACMSDI$NONVMS_CLIENTS is defined in Section 3.2.1.)

              After installing the TP Desktop Connector client kit
              on an OpenVMS system, transfer the appropriate archive
              file to your desktop system and execute it (see Sections
              3.2.2.1 through 3.2.2.3). After you expand the appropriate
              archive, the resulting files can then be used.

        3.2.2.1 Transfering Client Files to a 32-bit Microsoft System

              To place the client files on a 32-bit system on an Intel
              platform, transfer the appropriate archive file from the
              ACMSDI$NONVMS_CLIENTS directory on the OpenVMS system. For
              example:

              1. Use a network file transfer utility such as FTP to
                 copy from the OpenVMS system the INTEL32.EXE file (see
                 Table 3-1). For example:

                 a. On the client system, create a subdirectory to store
                    the software:

                    > mkdir c:\tpwa031

              After Installing from the Software Products Library CD 3-3

 






              b. Change directory to the newly created subdirectory:

                 > cd c:\tpwa031

              c. Connect to the OpenVMS system that contains the
                 archive file:

                 > ftp nodename
                    .
                    .
                    .
                 login to host
                    .
                    .
                    .
                 FTP>

                 The value of nodename is the name of the OpenVMS
                 system on which the archive is installed. At the FTP
                 prompts, supply the OpenVMS user name and password.
                 If you successfully log on to the OpenVMS system,
                 type commands at the FTP prompt to copy the archive
                 file from the OpenVMS directory to the client system
                 and close the FTP utility. For example:

                 FTP> binary
                 FTP> cd ACMSDI$NONVMS_CLIENTS:
                 FTP> get intel32.exe
                 FTP> quit

           2. On the client system, expand the archive file and
              delete it to recover disk space. For example:

              > intel32
              > del intel32.exe

           See Section 5.2 for information on setting up an
           environment for 32-bit Microsoft systems.

        3.2.2.2 Transfering Client Files to a 16-bit Microsoft System

              To place the client files on a 16-bit system on an Intel
              platform, transfer the appropriate archive file from the
              ACMSDI$NONVMS_CLIENTS directory on the OpenVMS system and
              expand it. For example:

              1. Use a network file transfer utility such as FTP to
                 copy from the OpenVMS system the INTEL16.EXE file (see
                 Table 3-1). For example:

                 a. On the client system, create a subdirectory to store
                    the software:

                    > mkdir c:\tpwa031

                 b. Change directory to the newly created subdirectory:

                    > cd c:\tpwa031

                 c. Connect to the OpenVMS system that contains the
                    archive file:

                    > ftp nodename
                       .
                       .
                       .
                    login to host
                       .
                       .

                    The value of nodename is the name of the OpenVMS
                    system on which the archive is installed. At the FTP
                    prompts, supply the OpenVMS user name and password.
                    If you successfully log on to the OpenVMS system,
                    type commands at the FTP prompt to copy the archive
                    file from the OpenVMS directory to the client system
                    and close the FTP utility. For example:

                    FTP> binary
                    FTP> cd ACMSDI$NONVMS_CLIENTS:
                    FTP> get intel16.exe
                    FTP> quit

              After Installing from the Software Products Library CD 3-5

 






           2. On the client system, expand the archive file and
              delete it to recover disk space. For example:

              > intel16
              > del intel16.exe

           For client services installation and setup, see Section 6.2.

     3.2.2.3 Transfering Client Files to a Tru64 UNIX System

           To place the client files on a Tru64 UNIX system, transfer
           the appropriate archive file from the ACMSDI$NONVMS_
           CLIENTS directory on the OpenVMS system. For example:

           1. Use a network file transfer utility such as FTP to
              copy from the OpenVMS system the dunix.exe file (see
              Table 3-1). For example:

              a. On the client system, create a directory under your
                 home directory:

                 > mkdir tpwa031dir

              b. Change to the new directory.

                 > cd tpwa031dir

              c. Connect to the OpenVMS system that contains the
                 archive file.

                 > ftp nodename
                    .
                    .
                    .
                 login to host
                    .
                    .
                    .
                 ftp>

                 The value of nodename is the name of the OpenVMS
                 system on which the archive is installed. At the FTP
                 prompts, supply the OpenVMS user name and password.
                 If you successfully log on, type commands at the FTP
                 prompt to copy the archive file and close the FTP
                 utility. For example:

     3-6 After Installing from the Software Products Library CD

 






                    ftp> binary
                    ftp> cd sys$common:[acmsdi.nonvms_clients]
                    ftp> get dunix.exe
                    ftp> quit

              2. On the client system, expand the archive file and
                 delete it to recover disk space. For example:

                 > chmod 755 dunix.exe
                 > ./dunix.exe
                 > rm dunix.exe

              The archive expands into two tar files (see Section 6.4).

        3.2.3 Installing the Client Services Interface on OpenVMS
              Systems

              The client services library is preconfigured for DECnet
              network access. To build applications that use NetWare or
              TCP/IP as a transport, you must reconfigure the library
              before creating executable programs.

              The following steps are necessary to set up the client
              services library for NetWare or TCP/IP access:

              1. Copy the library and related files to your home
                 directory with the following command:

                 $ copy/log ACMSDI$VMS:*.* []

              2. Remove the DECnet object from the library with the
                 following command:

                 $ library/delete = net_decnet acmsdi$client_objlib.olb

              3. For NetWare, insert the NetWare transport access module
                 into the library with the following command:

                 $ library/insert acmsdi$client_objlib.olb net_netware.obj

                 For TCP/IP, insert the TCP/IP transport access module
                 into the library with the following command:

                 $ library/insert acmsdi$client_objlib.olb net_tcpip.obj

              After these steps, you are ready to build TP Desktop
              Connector applications that use NetWare or TCP/IP as a
              transport. Table A-1 shows the files that are added to
              your desktop system during the installation of the TP
              Desktop Connector client services for OpenVMS.

     3.2.4 Verifying the Motif Client Sample on OpenVMS

           Copy, compile, link, and run the source code for the
           sample client program to verify your capability to build
           applications.

           To build the sample application, follow these steps:

           1. Copy the client sample files to your home directory
              using the following command:

              $  copy/log ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ_MOTIF:*.* []

              Table A-2 lists the files that are added to your
              desktop system.

           2. If you have MMS, use the MMS makefile provided to
              build the m_avertz sample application. In the sample
              directory, run MMS using the following command:

              $ MMS/DESC=M_AVERTZ

              If you download TP Desktop Connector libraries to a
              different location, edit the makefile to indicate the
              new location of the libraries.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              On OpenVMS Alpha systems, the makefile expects the
              logical ACMSDI$VMS_ALPHA to point to the directory
              that contains the TP Desktop Connector client
              library. In addition, on OpenVMS Alpha systems,
              the first time that the makefile tries to create the
              DECwindows library, the makefile fails. When this
              happens, rerun MMS to continue the build.<>

              _____________________________________________________

              If you do not have MMS, use the makefile as a guide to
              build the application yourself.

           3. Run the application by entering the following command:

              > run m_avertz/nodebug

           The m_avertz application displays the menu bar of the
           AVERTZ Car Reservation System. If you want the sample
           desktop client program to communicate with the ACMS
           application, follow the procedures in Section 6.3.3 to set
           up the sample application on the ACMS system. After you

     3-8 After Installing from the Software Products Library CD

 






              set up the ACMS system, use the Session menu to sign in to
              the ACMS system. After you sign in, you can use the Rental
              menu to run the reserve task of the AVERTZ application.

              The installation procedure is now complete and verified.

        3.3 Setting Up the Avertz ACMS Sample Application on an OpenVMS
            System

              The command procedure VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP.COM sets up
              the sample application. You need SYSPRV privilege to run
              the procedure. Refer to the file ACMSDI$VR_APPLICATION_
              INFO.TXT in the ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ directory for more
              information on setting up the sample.

              To prepare the AVERTZ sample application on the Compaq
              OpenVMS system, do the following:

              1. Run the command procedure to set up the application:

                 $ @ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ:VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP
                    .
                    .
                    .
                 $

              2. Start the ACMS system (if necessary) and the applica-
                 tion:

                 $ ACMS/START SYSTEM
                 $ ACMS/START APPLICATION VR_DA_APPL

              3. Perform other management tasks related to your system,
                 for example, authorizing user accounts. Refer to the
                 management information in Compaq TP Desktop Connector
                 for ACMS Client Application Programming Guide.

              The following sections provide additional information
              about using the Avertz sample application on the ACMS
              OpenVMS system.





              After Installing from the Software Products Library CD 3-9

 






     3.3.1 Using the Avertz ACMS Sample with Rdb Version 6.0 with
           Multiversion

           When you execute the VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP.COM file to set
           up the sample application, this command file invokes two
           option files, VR_READ_SERVER.OPT and VR_UPDATE_SERVER.OPT,
           which refer to the SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USER library. On a
           system with Rdb Version 6.0 with multiversion installed,
           the SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USER file is not available. Instead,
           the version number is appended to the file name, for
           instance, SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USER60.

           To work around this naming mismatch problem, you can
           define the logical name SQL$USER to reference the
           appropriate library file. For example:

           $ DEFINE SQL$USER SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USER60

           Modify the linker options files:

              ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ:VR_READ_SERVER.OPT
              ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ:VR_UPDATE_SERVER.OPT

           Replace the line

           SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USERnn.OLB/LIBRARY

           with the following:

           SYS$USER/LIBRARY

     3.3.2 Building the Avertz ACMS Sample with DECforms V1.4

           The VR_FORM.IFDL file of the Avertz ACMS sample applica-
           tion cannot be compiled under DECforms Version 1.4. This
           is because the DECforms Version 1.4 IFDL parser no longer
           recognizes the colon symbol (:), which the VR_FORM.IFDL
           file uses.

           To get around this problem, put double quotation marks
           around the text containing the ":" symbol in the VR_
           FORM.IFDL file.

           For example, change the following:

                  Copy
                       AVERTZ_CDD_FIELD:CUSTOMER_ID from Dictionary
                  End Copy

     3-10 After Installing from the Software Products Library CD

 






              To look like:

                     Copy
                          "AVERTZ_CDD_FIELD:CUSTOMER_ID" from Dictionary
                     End Copy

        3.3.3 User Name Quotas for the Avertz ACMS Sample

              The VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP.COM command file assigns quotas
              for the AVERTZ_EXC, AVERTZ_UPD, and AVERTZ_READ user
              names that are adequate for running the VR_DA_APPL
              sample application. If your system already has these user
              names defined, the quotas for these user names might be
              inadequate for VR_DA_APPL. If you are using the AVERTZ
              sample application, delete the AVERTZ_EXC, AVERTZ_UPD,
              and AVERTZ_READ user names before running VR_DA_RUNTIME_
              SETUP.COM to ensure that you get appropriate quotas for
              these user names.

              To ensure the success of the operations in the VR_DA_
              RUNTIME_SETUP.COM command procedure, run it from the
              system account.

        3.3.4 Access Control List for the Avertz ACMS Sample

              The VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP.COM procedure adds the AVERTZ
              application name VR_DA_APPL to the ACMS database. The
              command line to do so includes the ACL qualifier and
              assigns the ID as /ID=SYSTEM. This might fail on your
              system.

              To ensure that the VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP.COM procedure
              works, change the ID=SYSTEM to ID=[UIC], where UIC is
              that of the account SYSTEM; for example, ID=[1,4].

        3.3.5 Rebuilding the Avertz ACMS Sample

              Executables are provided for the sample. You do not need
              to rebuild the sample to run it. However, a DEC/MMS
              description file is provided for rebuilding the sample
              to incorporate any changes you make to the sample.

              To modify and rebuild the sample, follow these steps:

              1. Copy the sample sources to another directory.

             After Installing from the Software Products Library CD 3-11

 






           2. Use the command procedure VR_DA_BLD_MMS.COM to
              rebuild the sample under a different ADB name in that
              directory:

              a. Create the CDD directories for the AVERTZ compo-
                 nents.

              b. Define logical names.

                 If you are using a directory other than ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_
                 AVERTZ for rebuilding the sample, edit the logical
                 name definitions in the VR_DA_BLD_LOGICALS.COM
                 command procedure to point to your file and CDD
                 directories. Make these edits before running the BLD
                 portion of the VR_DA_BLD_MMS.COM command procedure.

              c. Perform other setup and build activities.

           3. Run the command procedure VR_DA_BLD_MMS.COM without
              parameters:

              $ @ACMSDI$EXAMPLES:VR_DA_BLD_MMS

              All the setup and build activities are performed.

           To perform a specific activity, specify one of the
           parameters in Table 6-3.

                         Before Installing TP Desktop Connector Software



              This chapter describes the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing Compaq TP Desktop Connector
              software and also contains information on removing TP
              Desktop Connector software from Win32 platforms. Your
              bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report (BIL)
              specify the number and contents of your media. Be sure
              to verify the contents of your kit with this information.
              If your kit is damaged or incomplete, contact your Compaq
              representative.

        4.1 Installation Overview

              The TPware Product Suite CD contains all the software
              required for development or deployment of TP Desktop
              Connector client applications, except for the gateway
              needed to connect to an ACMS system. The gateway software
              is distributed separately. Table 4-1 lists the contents of
              the TPware Product Suite CD.

              As shown in Table 4-1, all TP Desktop Connector files
              are provided on the TPware Product Suite CD. This compact
              disk is in ISO9660 standard format and contains executable
              programs that install the appropriate files. You must
              have a Windows NT or Windows 95/98 system with a CD drive
              on which to run the installation procedures that are
              described in Chapter 5.

              TP Desktop Connector supports the following platforms in
              addition to 32-bit Microsoft operating systems (Windows NT
              and Windows 95/98):

              o  16-bit Microsoft operating systems running on Intel
                 platforms

              o  Compaq OpenVMS running on VAX or Alpha systems

              o  Tru64 UNIX systems

           o  Macintosh systems

           If you are developing TP Desktop Connector client
           applications for any of the above non-Win32 systems, you
           must install the client services files yourself. Refer to
           Chapters 6 and 7.

           __________________________________________________________


     4.2 Preparing to Install TP Desktop Connector Software

           Ensure that your system meets the software requirements.
           Minimum software requirements needed to install the TP
           Desktop Connector software and build client applications
           that run with ACMS systems are shown in the Software
           Product Description (SPD), a copy of which is included
           in the product kit.

     4.2.1 Product Licenses

           To install TP Desktop Connector products, you must have
           a Product License Key. This is a paper certificate that
           contains information about the license you have to run a
           particular piece of software. You are asked to enter the
           license key during the installation procedure.

     4.2.2 Disk Space

           Installing TP Desktop Connector software requires a
           certain amount of free storage space, which depends on the
           platform you use. Table 4-2 shows the storage requirements
           for TP Desktop Connector software.

           Table_4-2_TP_Desktop_Connector_Disk_Space_Requirements____

           __________________________Intel_______________Alpha_______

           Kilobytes_(KB)____________6_063_______________6_517_______

              ________________________Note ________________________

              These are the minimum disk space requirements. These
              estimates, though conservative, are not always
              an accurate indicator of the disk space used on
              a particular machine. System disk configuration,
              including the size of the disk sector and the number
              of sectors per cluster, cannot be determined by
              the installation program. Therefore, some systems
              require more space.

              _____________________________________________________

              See Table 6-2 for the disk space required for TP Desktop
              Connector client services software on non-Win32 systems.

        4.3 Removing the Installed Software

              You might decide to remove the installed TPware software
              to upgrade to a new TPware software version, or for other
              reasons. Note that when you remove the software, you lose
              the settings defined in the TPware Management Utility.
              Before removing the software, refer to the Release Notes
              for instructions on saving your management settings.

               Installing TP Desktop Connector Software on Win32 Systems



              This chapter describes the procedures for installing or
              reinstalling the Compaq TP Desktop Connector software
              from the TPware Product Suite CD on Microsoft Windows NT
              running on an Intel or a Compaq Alpha system, or Windows
              95/98 on an Intel system. This chapter also contains
              information on postinstallation tasks on Windows NT or
              Windows 95/98 systems.

              For information on installing TP Desktop Connector
              software on non-Win32 platforms, see Chapters 6 and 7.

              For information on installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway
              for ACMS software, see Part III of this guide (Chapters 8
              through 11).

        5.1 TP Desktop Connector Software Installation Procedure

              To install TP Desktop Connector software, run one of the
              setup programs provided on the TPware Product Suite CD.
              Double-click one of the following:

              E:\alpha32\setup.exe
              E:\intel32\setup.exe

              Replace E: with the correct drive letter for your system.

              The setup program displays a splash screen and a progress
              indicator while it initializes its wizard. When setup
              starts, you see a series of dialog boxes. The following
              table lists the operations associated with the command
              buttons in the dialog boxes.

           __________________________________________________________
           To_do_this...___________________Click_this_button:________

           Complete the choices in a       Next
           dialog box and continue

           Return to a previous dialog     Back
           box

           Exit without completing the     Cancel
           installation______________________________________________

           Follow the instructions in the dialog boxes to select
           installation of TP Desktop Connector.

           The setup utility checks whether there is sufficient
           disk storage, copies the appropriate files, and performs
           registry operations.

           If setup finds that a requisite software product is not
           installed or that the minimum version of a requisite
           product is not on the system, it displays a Warning box
           showing the product name and version. The installation
           might continue after the warning or it might fail,
           depending on the prerequisite. If the installation
           continues, you must install the prerequisite software
           before you can actually use TP Desktop Connector software.

     5.2 After Installing TP Desktop Connector Software

           This section describes some procedures you might want to
           perform after you copy files from the OpenVMS system (see
           Section 3.2.2.1) or after the setup program finishes (see
           Section 5.1).

     5.2.1 Setting Up the TPware Environment

           Before developing TPware client applications, you must
           set up the environment variables that TPware software
           requires. To do this, run the command file installed by
           the setup program:

           C:\TPware\stdl\bin\stdl_set_version.bat

              ________________________Note ________________________

              All examples show the default location. If you
              chose a different destination while running setup,

     5-2 Installing TP Desktop Connector Software on Win32 Systems

 






                substitute your own drive and folder for C:\TPware.

                _____________________________________________________

        5.2.2 Accessing the ACMS System

              For access to a Compaq ACMS transaction processing
              system, the TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS must be
              installed on the OpenVMS system. The gateway software is
              distributed on a separate CD; instructions for installing
              it are contained in Part III of this guide.

        5.2.3 Defining the Network Transport for the Client Services
              Interface

              TP Desktop Connector software supports both DECnet and
              TCP/IP network transports for Windows NT or Windows 95/98
              clients. The product files include two versions of the
              client application's dynamic link library (DLL); one for
              DECnet and one for TCP/IP. These files are installed, by
              default, in:

              C:\TPware\stdl_rt\bin\acmsdiDN.dll
              C:\TPware\stdl_rt\bin\acmsdiWS.dll

              To set up the TP Desktop Connector software for your
              network transport, copy the appropriate DLL from the
              installation folder to your working directory, and rename
              it acmsdi.dll. The acmsdiDN.dll provides DECnet support
              and works with PATHWORKS 32. The acmsdiWS.dll provides
              TCP/IP support and also works with PATHWORKS 32.

        5.2.4 Verifying the TP Desktop Connector Installation

              To verify that your TP Desktop Connector software is
              installed correctly, you can run one of the sample
              applications provided.

              If you are developing an application that uses the
              Adapter Interface (refer to Compaq TP Desktop Connector
              Getting Started), both the sample applications and the
              instructions for running them are online. To read the
              instructions, choose the ACMS Samples item from the TP
              Desktop Connector for ACMS menu in the TPware Products
              program group.

           Installing TP Desktop Connector Software on Win32 Systems 5-3

 






           For a TP Desktop Connector application that uses the
           Client Services Interface,[*] you must have platform-
           specific TP Desktop Connector client software on your
           development system. All the client services files are on
           the TPware Product Suite CD. If you are developing a TP
           Desktop Connector client application that uses the Client
           Services Interface, in a non-Win32 operating system, you
           must transfer the TP Desktop Connector client services
           files to your desktop development system yourself. How to
           do this varies according to platform:

           o  For 16-bit Microsoft systems, Compaq OpenVMS, and Tru64
              UNIX systems, see Chapter 6.

           o  For Apple Macintosh systems, see Chapter 7.

           If you are developing a TP Desktop Connector client
           application that uses the Client Services Interface on
           a Win32 system, the client services files are installed
           on your desktop by the setup program with the rest of the
           development tools. The instructions for setting up the
           client services and running the sample programs are in
           Sections 5.2.5 and 5.2.6. You do not need to read Chapters
           6 and 7.

     5.2.5 Running the Win32 Sample Client Applications

           TP Desktop Connector client services include two sample
           applications for Win32 clients:

           o  For Windows 95, in PowerBuilder, a simplified version
              of the original AVERTZ for Windows described in the
              ACMS manuals. This sample illustrates the execution of
              an ACMS task with no exchange I/O.

              Table A-3 describes the contents of the PowerBuilder
              sample folder TPware\STDL\Samples\acmsdi\PB.

              For directions on running the PowerBuilder sample, read
              the three .doc files in the sample folder.

           o  For Windows 95/98 or Windows NT, the same Visual Basic
              AVERTZ sample that was provided for ACMS Desktop V2.0;
              it is a blocking, no exchange I/O client.

           ___________________

                 Table A-4 describes the contents of the Visual Basic
                 sample folder TPware\STDL\Samples\acmsdi\VB.

              The following files provide memory copy procedures and
              can be used to help with interfacing Visual Basic Win32
              programs with the TP Desktop Connector client services:

                 C:\TPware\STDL\lib\divb.lib
                 C:\TPware\STDL_RT\bin\divb.dll
                 C:\TPware\STDL_RT\bin\msvcrt40.dll

              To verify the success of your TP Desktop Connector client
              services installation, you can run the Visual Basic sample
              application. Follow these steps:

              1. Start up the Visual Basic development environment in
                 Windows 95.

              2. Open the VBAVERTZ project.


























           Installing TP Desktop Connector Software on Win32 Systems 5-5

 






           3. Verify that all the required files were loaded (see the
              VBAVERTZ project window):

                 vbavertz.bas
                 mainmenu.frm
                 reserve.frm
                 signin.frm

              Double click each item in the project window to verify
              that it loads properly.

           4. Run the interpreted version of VBAVERTZ (choose the
              Start command from the Run menu).

     5.2.6 Code Conversion Libraries for Kanji

           TP Desktop Connector client services (on Windows 95
           systems only) provides code conversion libraries for Kanji
           users, which convert Shift JIS code to DEC Kanji code
           and DEC Kanji code to Shift JIS code. You can link these
           libraries with your client application, if it requires
           Kanji code conversion.

           The following files are installed for Kanji applications:

              C:\TPware\stdl\lib\jcnvwin.lib
              C:\TPware\stdl\include\jcnvwin.h
              C:\TPware\help\jcnvwin_guide.ps
              C:\TPware\help\jcnvwin_guide.txt

           For usage information, refer to either the PostScript or
           the text version of the Japanese conversion guide.

     6.1 Overview of the Client Services Installation

           The TPware Product Suite CD is in ISO 9660 standard
           format. The instructions in this chapter assume that
           you can mount this CD directly on your desktop system.
           If you can not, you will have to use ftp or some other
           network file transport to get the files from a Windows 95
           or Windows NT system that has the TPware CD mounted.

           The client services are provided as self-extracting
           archive files that expand upon execution. In general,
           the procedure for installing the client services and
           accompanying sample client application files consists
           of the following steps:

           1. Transfer a client services archive to your desktop
              platform

              ACMS is installed

     6-4 Installing the TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems

 






              o  Valid account (user name and password) on the OpenVMS
                 system on which the TP Desktop Connector Gateway for
                 ACMS is installed

              o  Directory of the network file transfer software in your
                 directory search path or on your CD-ROM

              o  Directory in which the TPware files reside on an
                 OpenVMS system, or your CD-ROM device (usually E:\)

              o  Directory in which to install the client services
                 software

              o  Sufficient disk space, as shown in Table 6-2

              o  Host name for TCP/IP

        6.2 Installing the Client Services for 16-Bit Microsoft Systems

              TP Desktop Connector provides one self-extracting archive
              named i16clint.exe that contains all the client services
              files for both DOS and Windows 3.11 clients. The files
              contained within the archive include the static-link (LIB)
              and the dynamic-linked (DLL) libraries. Also included
              are individual object files and DLLs for the supported
              transports.

              If you install the software from the TPware Product Suite
              CD (see Section 5.1), transfer the archive file from the
              Windows NT system to your desktop system. For example:

              1. On the client system, create a subdirectory to store
                 the software:

                 C:\> mkdir ACMSDI

              2. Change directory to the newly created subdirectory:

                 C:\> cd ACMSDI

              3. Copy the archive file to the newly created subdirec-
                 tory.

                 C:\ACMSDI> copy E:\intel16\i16clint.exe

              If you install the software from the Software Products
              Library CD (see Section 3.2.2.2), change directory to the
              location containing the client files.

 the       TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems 6-5

 






           To install the client services software, execute the
           archive file and delete it to recover disk space. For
           example:

           > i16clint
           > del i16clint.exe

           The archive expands, and the resulting files can then be
           used.

           If this is to be your working directory, you need to set
           the environment variables that define the paths for the
           libraries, include files, and executables. Add commands to
           your autoexec.bat file. For example:

           set LIB=%LIB%;ACMSDI
           set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;ACMSDI
           set PATH=%PATH%;ACMSDI

     6.2.1 Setting Up the Client Services for DOS

           The DOS client services use the static-link library
           ACMSDIL.LIB, which supports DECnet by default. Additional
           network transport object files are provided for the large-
           memory model, whose names reflects the transport they
           support.

           __________________________________________________________
           Memory_Model__DECnet________TCP/IP________Netware_________

           Large_________netdecl.obj___nettcpl.obj___netwarel.obj____

           If you are not using DECnet, remove the DECnet module and
           insert the module that corresponds to the transport you
           are using. For example, to set up up the large model for
           TCP/IP:

           LIB ACMSDIL.LIB -NETDECL;
           LIB ACMSDIL.LIB +NETTCPL;

        6.2.2 Installing the Sample Client Application for DOS

              The client services sample for DOS is written in Microsoft
              COBOL and is in a self-extracting archive file named
              i16cobol.exe. If you install the software from the TPware
              Product Suite CD (see Section 5.1), transfer the archive
              file from the Windows NT system to your desktop system.
              For example:

              C:\ACMSDI\> mkdir cobol
              C:\ACMSDI\> cd cobol
              C:\ACMSDI\COBOL> copy e:\intel16\Samples\i16cobol.exe

              If you install the software from the Software Products
              Library CD (see Section 3.2.2.2), change directory to the
              location containing the client files.

              To install the client services sample for DOS, execute
              the archive file and delete it to recover disk space. For
              example:

              C:\ACMSDI\COBOL> i16cobol.exe
              C:\ACMSDI\COBOL> del i16cobol.exe

              Table A-5 shows the resulting files.

              The sample executable was built using the DECnet
              libraries. If you are not running DECnet, you need to
              relink the sample before you can run it.

        6.2.3 Verifying the Client Services Installation for DOS

              Compile, link, and run the source code for the sample
              client program to verify your capability to build
              applications. You need the following products on your
              desktop system to build the sample application:

              o  Compiler (preferably Microsoft C) that can access
                 objects compiled by Microsoft Visual C++ Version 1.5 or
                 higher

              o  C runtime library that is compatible with Microsoft
                 Visual C++ Version 1.5

              o  COBOL compiler compatible with Microsoft COBOL software
                 (required only to build the sample application)

 the       TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems 6-7

 






           The client services samples include two batch files to
           build the COBOL client program. You can modify these files
           according to your own software development environment.
           After you modify the files, run them. For example:

           C:\ACMSDI\COBOL> bld-pps
              .
              .
              .
           C:\ACMSDI\COBOL> bld-cli
              .
              .
              .

           To run the sample client program, enter the following
           command:

           C:\ACMSDI\COBOL> client

           The client program displays the main menu of the AVERTZ
           Vehicle Rental System application.

           To connect the sample program to the AVERTZ sample
           application, follow the procedures in Section 6.3.3 to
           set up the sample application on the ACMS system. You can
           sign in to the ACMS system and use the reserve task of the
           application.

           The DOS installation procedure is now complete and
           verified.

     6.2.4 Setting Up the Client Services for Windows 3.11

           You would normally use a DLL when building applications
           under Windows. However, you can use the static-link
           libraries provided with TP Desktop Connector if you
           prefer, when the transport is DECnet.

           The client services sample for Windows 3.11 expects to
           find a DLL called acmsdi.dll To set up the client services
           for your network transport, copy one of the files below to
           your working directory and rename it acmsdi.dll.

           __________________________________________________________
           DECnet___________TCP/IP___________Netware_________________

           acmsdiDN.dll_____acmsdiWS.dll_____acmsdiNW.dll____________

     6-8 Installing the TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems

 






              For example, to use TCP/IP with the Winsock interface:

              C:\ACMSDI> mkdir sdk311
              C:\ACMSDI> copy acmsdiWS.dll sdk311\acmsdi.dll

              There is an executable file, diTskLnk.exe, that supports
              multiple executables sharing a submitter session under
              Windows Version 3.1 using TCP/IP. Refer to Compaq TP
              Desktop Connector for ACMS Gateway Management Guide for
              information on this executable file.

        6.2.5 Code Conversion Libraries for Kanji

              TP Desktop Connector provides code conversion libraries
              for Kanji users, which convert Shift JIS code to DEC
              Kanji code and DEC Kanji code to Shift JIS code. You can
              link these libraries with your client application, if it
              requires Kanji code conversion.

              These libraries are located in the following archive file:

              E:\intel16\win16\jcnvwin.exe

              For usage information, refer to JCNVWIN_GUIDE.PS or
              JCNVWIN_GUIDE.TXT, which are installed when you expand
              the archive.

        6.2.6 Installing the Sample Application for Windows 3.11

              The client services sample for Windows 3.11 is written in
              C and is provided in the following self-extracting archive
              files.

              i16sdklb.exe     Contains both the sample sources and the
                               make file for using the DECnet medium
                               model static-link library.

              i16sdkdl.exe     Contains just the alternate files needed
                               to rebuild the sample client against
                               DLLs. The resulting executable file
                               can work with any of the supported
                               transports.

              If you install the software from the TPware Product
              Suite CD (see Section 5.1), transfer the archive file
              i16sdklb.exe from the Windows NT system to your desktop
              system. For example:

 the       TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems 6-9

 






           C:\ACMSDI> cd sdk311
           C:\ACMSDI\SDK311> copy e:\intel16\Samples\i16sdklb.exe

           If you install the software from the Software Products
           Library CD (see Section 3.2.2.2), change directory to the
           location containing the client files.

           To install the software, execute the archive file and
           delete it to recover disk space. For example:

           C:\ACMSDI\SDK311> i16sdklb.exe
           C:\ACMSDI\SDK311> del i16sdklb.exe

           If you want the DLL version, first get the sources as
           above, then get the other archive i16sdkdl.exe, and run
           it. This overrides the static-link makefiles. For example:

           C:\ACMSDI\SDK311> copy e:\intel16\Samples\i16sdkdl.exe
           C:\ACMSDI\SDK311> i16sdkdl.exe
           C:\ACMSDI\SDK311> del i16sdkdl.exe

           Table A-6 shows the resulting files.

     6.2.7 Verifying the Client Services Installation on Windows
           3.11

           Compile, link, and run the source code for the sample
           client program to verify your capability to build
           applications. You need the following products on your
           desktop system to build the C language sample application:

           o  Compiler (preferably Microsoft C) that can access
              objects compiled by Microsoft Visual C++ Version 1.52
              or higher

           o  C runtime library that is compatible with Microsoft
              Visual C++ Version 1.52

           o  Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Version 3.11.

           o  If building against static link libraries, you need the
              PATHWORKS Version 5.1 Software Developer's Kit.

           To verify the installation of the TP Desktop Connector
           client services for Windows 3.11, follow these steps:

           1. Using the AVERTZ makefile, build the sample application
              by running nmake in the directory that contains the
              sample files.

              2. Run Windows by entering the following command:

                 C:\ACMSDI\SDK311> win

              3. Run the AVERTZ program by one of the following
                 methods:

                 o  Use the Run command:

                    a. In the Program Manager File menu, select the Run
                       command.

                    b. In the dialog box that appears, type the
                       location:

                       \ACMSDI\SDK311\avertz

                 o  Add the AVERTZ program icon to the screen and double
                    click on it:

                    a. In the Program Manager File menu, select the New
                       command.

                       This creates a group window to contain the icon.

                    b. In the dialog box, select the new program group
                       and click the OK button.

                    c. At the description prompt, type a name for the
                       group window. For example:

                       ACMS Desktop Samples

                    d. Give a file name for the group window. For
                       example:

                       C:\ACMSDI\SDK311\sample

                       After you enter the name, a window appears having
                       the group window name.

                    e. Click on the new group window to select it.

                    f. In the Program Manager's File menu, select the
                       New command to add the AVERTZ icon to the group
                       window.

                    g. In the dialog box, select new Program Item.

                 h. In the description prompt, type the icon caption.
                    For example:

                    AVERTZ

                 i. After the command-line prompt, type the location
                    of the AVERTZ executable file. For example:

                    C:\ACMSDI\SDK311

                 j. In the dialog box, click the OK button.

                    The AVERTZ icon appears in the group window.

                 k. Double click the AVERTZ icon to run the sample
                    client program.

           The AVERTZ program displays the menu bar of the AVERTZ
           Vehicle Rental System application.

           If you want the sample desktop client program to
           communicate with the ACMS application, follow the
           procedures in Section 6.3.3 to set up the sample
           application on the ACMS system. After you set up the
           ACMS system, use the Session menu to sign in to the ACMS
           system. After you sign in, you can use the Rental menu to
           run the reserve task of the AVERTZ application.

           The Windows 3.11 installation procedure is now complete
           and verified.

     6.2.8 Installing the PowerBuilder Sample Application

           There is a PowerBuilder Version 5.0 sample application
           provided as a self-extracting archive file named
           i16pbkit.exe. This sample is a simplified version of the
           original Avertz for Windows; it illustrates the execution
           of an ACMS task with no exchange I/O.

           The archive provides a PowerBuilder library, pbaverz.pbl,
           that contains the PowerBuilder objects for the Avertz
           client application, and a dynamic-link library, pb-
           pointr.dll that is required for memory management when
           building PowerBuilder applications that use TP Desktop
           Connector gateway for ACMS services.

              If you install the software from the TPware Product Suite
              CD (see Section 5.1), transfer the archive file from the
              Windows NT system to your desktop system. For example:

              C:\ACMSDI> mkdir pbsmp
              C:\ACMSDI> cd pbsmp
              C:\ACMSDI\PBSMP> copy e:\intel16\i16pbkit.exe

              If you install the software from the Software Products
              Library CD (see Section 3.2.2.2), change directory to the
              location containing the client files.

              To install the software, execute the archive file and
              delete it to recover disk space. For example:

              C:\ACMSDI\PBSMP> i16pbkit.exe
              C:\ACMSDI\PBSMP> del i16pbkit.exe

              Table A-7 lists the files that are added to your system.
              For instructions on using the PowerBuilder sample, read
              the three .doc files shown in Table A-7.

        6.2.9 Installing the Visual Basic Sample Applications

              There are two Visual Basic sample applications provided
              in the form of self-extracting archive files. The file
              \intel16\Samples\i16vbavz.exe contains the files for the
              same sample that was provided for ACMS Desktop V2.0; it is
              a blocking, no exchange I/O client.

              The file i16vbfnb.exe (in the same folder) contains the
              files of a tutorial sample showing how to program to the
              new TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS forced non-
              blocking interface. This interface allows languages like
              Visual Basic to issue non-blocking calls to TP Desktop
              Connector gateway for ACMS and provides support for
              programming ACMS exchange I/O interface calls.

              If you install the software from the TPware Product Suite
              CD (see Section 5.1), transfer the archive file from the
              Windows NT system to your desktop system. For example:

              C:\ACMSDI> mkdir vbavertz
              C:\ACMSDI> cd vbavertz
              C:\ACMSDI\VBAVERTZ> copy e:\Samples\i16vbavz.exe

           If you install the software from the Software Products
           Library CD (see Section 3.2.2.2), change directory to the
           location containing the client files.

           To install the sample software, execute the archive file
           and delete it to recover disk space. For example:

           C:\ACMSDI\VBAVERTZ> i16vbavz.exe
           C:\ACMSDI\VBAVERTZ> del i16vbavz.exe

           Table A-8 lists the files added to your system from the
           Avertz archive; Table A-9 lists the files from the Forced
           Nonblocking tutorial.

     6.2.9.1 Verifying the Visual Basic Avertz Sample Installation

                    MTEXT.BAS
                    NONBLK.BAS

                 Double click each entry in the project window to verify
                 that it loads properly.

              5. Run the interpreted version of FNBSAMPL by selecting
                 the Start command from the Run menu.

        6.3 Installing the Client Services for OpenVMS

              The client services files for OpenVMS are provided as a
              compressed saveset that you can copy from the TPware CD
              mounted on your desktop platform. After copying the client
              services software, you decompress the file and restore the
              saveset.

              Follow these instructions to install the client services
              for OpenVMS:

              1. Create the client services directory on the desktop
                 system.

                 Note that this directory must be created from a user
                 account, not from the system account.

                 $ create/dir [.acmsdi]

 the      TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems 6-15

 






           2. Copy the file to the newly created directory.

              For OpenVMS VAX systems:

              $ set def [.acmsdi]
              $ copy cd:[vmsvax]vms_client.exe []
              $ run vms_client.exe
                 .
                 .
                 .
     <Return>
               accept the default output filename
                 .
                 .
                 .
              $ backup vms_client.sav/save *.*/log  <>

              For OpenVMS Alpha systems:

              $ set def [.acmsdi]
              $ copy cd:[vmsalpha]vms_client.exe []
              $ run vms_client.exe
                 .
                 .
                 .
     <Return>
               accept the default output filename
                 .
                 .
                 .
              $ backup vms_client.sav/save *.*/log  <>

           3. The TP Desktop Connector library is preconfigured for
              DECnet network access. To build applications that use
              NetWare or TCP/IP as a transport, you must reconfigure
              the library before creating executable programs.

              The following steps are necessary to set up the
              TP Desktop Connector library for NetWare or TCP/IP
              access:

              a. Remove the DECnet object from the library with the
                 following command:

                 $ library/delete = net_decnet acmsdi$client_objlib.olb

     6-16 Installing the TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems

 






                 b. For NetWare, insert the NetWare transport access
                    module into the library with the following command:

                    $ library/insert acmsdi$client_objlib.olb net_netware.obj

                    For TCP/IP, insert the TCP/IP transport access
                    module into the library with the following command:

                    $ library/insert acmsdi$client_objlib.olb net_tcpip.obj

              After these steps, you are ready to build TP Desktop
              Connector applications that use NetWare or TCP/IP as a
              transport. Table A-1 shows the files that are added to
              your desktop system during the installation of the TP
              Desktop Connector client services for OpenVMS.

        6.3.1 Installing the Motif Sample Client for OpenVMS

              To install the Motif sample files on the OpenVMS desktop
              system, perform the following steps:

              1. Create a directory on the desktop system to contain the
                 sample files and move to that directory:

                 $ create/dir [.motif_avertz]
                 $ set def [.motif_avertz]

              2. Copy the Motif sample file.

                 For OpenVMS VAX systems:

                 $ copy cd:[vmsvax.samples]vms_avertz.exe [] <>

                 For OpenVMS Alpha systems:

                 $ copy cd:[vmsalpha.samples]vms_avertz.exe [] <>

              3. Decompress the executable and restore the saveset:

                 $ run vms_avertz.exe
                    .
                    .
                    .
        <Return>
                  accept the default output filename
                    .
                    .
                    .
                 $ backup/restore vms_avertz.sav/save *.*/log

           4. Copy the Motif resource file to your home directory:

              $ copy m_avertz.dat  sys$login:m_avertz.dat

           Table A-2 lists the files that are added to your desktop
           system.

     6.3.2 Verifying the Motif Sample Installation on OpenVMS

           Compile, link, and run the source code for the sample
           client program to verify your capability to build
           applications.

           To build the sample application, follow these steps:

           1. If you have MMS, use the MMS makefile provided to
              build the m_avertz sample application. In the sample
              directory, run MMS using the following command:

              $ MMS

              If you download TP Desktop Connector libraries to a
              different location, edit the makefile to indicate the
              new location of the libraries.





















     6-18 Installing the TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems

 






                ________________________Note  ________________________

                On OpenVMS Alpha systems, the makefile expects the
                logical ACMSDI$VMS_ALPHA to point to the directory
                that contains the TP Desktop Connector client
                library. In addition, on OpenVMS Alpha systems,
                the first time that the makefile tries to create the
                DECwindows library, the makefile fails. When this
                happens, rerun MMS to continue the build.<>

                _____________________________________________________

                 If you do not have MMS, use the makefile as a guide to
                 build the application yourself.

              2. Run the application by entering the following command:

                 > run m_avertz/nodebug

              The m_avertz application displays the menu bar of the
              AVERTZ Car Reservation System. If you want the sample
              desktop client program to communicate with the ACMS
              application, follow the procedures in Section 6.3.3 to set
              up the sample application on the ACMS system. After you
              set up the ACMS system, use the Session menu to sign in to
              the ACMS system. After you sign in, you can use the Rental
              menu to run the reserve task of the AVERTZ application.

              The installation procedure is now complete and verified.

        6.3.3 Setting Up the Avertz ACMS Sample Application on an
              OpenVMS System

              The command procedure VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP.COM sets up the
              sample application. You need SYSPRV privilege to run the
              procedure. See the file ACMSDI$VR_APPLICATION_INFO.TXT in
              the ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ directory for more information
              on setting up the sample.

              To prepare the AVERTZ sample application on a Compaq
              OpenVMS system, do the following:

              1. Run the command procedure to set up the application:


 the      TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems 6-19

 






              $ @ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ:VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP
                 .
                 .
                 .
              $

           2. Start the ACMS system (if necessary) and the applica-
              tion:

              $ ACMS/START SYSTEM
              $ ACMS/START APPLICATION VR_DA_APPL

           3. Perform other management tasks related to your system,
              for example, authorizing user accounts. Refer to the
              management information in Compaq TP Desktop Connector
              for ACMS Client Application Programming Guide.

           The following sections provide additional information
           about using the Avertz sample application on the ACMS
           OpenVMS system.

     6.3.3.1 Using the Avertz ACMS Sample with Rdb Version 6.0 with
             Multi-Version

           When you execute the VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP.COM file to set
           up the sample application, this command file invokes two
           option files, VR_READ_SERVER.OPT and VR_UPDATE_SERVER.OPT,
           which reference the SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USER library. On a
           system with Rdb Version 6.0 with multi-version installed,
           the SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USER file is not available. Instead,
           the version number is appended to the file name, for
           instance, SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USER60.

           To work around this naming mismatch problem, you can
           define the logical name SQL$USER to reference the
           appropriate library file. For example:

           $ DEFINE SQL$USER SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USER60

           Modify the linker options files:

              ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ:VR_READ_SERVER.OPT
              ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ:VR_UPDATE_SERVER.OPT

           Replace the line

           SYS$LIBRARY:SQL$USERnn.OLB/LIBRARY

              with the following:

              SYS$USER/LIBRARY

        6.3.3.2 Building the Avertz ACMS Sample with DECforms V1.4

              The VR_FORM.IFDL file of the Avertz ACMS sample applica-
              tion can not be compiled under DECforms Version 1.4. This
              is because the DECforms Version 1.4 IFDL parser no longer
              recognizes the colon symbol (:), which the VR_FORM.IFDL
              file uses.

              To get around this problem, put double quotation marks
              around the text containing the ":" symbol in the VR_
              FORM.IFDL file.

              For example, change the following:

                          AVERTZ_CDD_FIELD:CUSTOMER_ID from Dictionary
                     End Copy

              To look like:

                     Copy
                          "AVERTZ_CDD_FIELD:CUSTOMER_ID" from Dictionary
                     End Copy

        6.3.3.3 User Name Quotas for the Avertz ACMS Sample

              The VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP.COM command file assigns quotas
              for the AVERTZ_EXC, AVERTZ_UPD, and AVERTZ_READ user
              names that are adequate for running the VR_DA_APPL
              sample application. If your system already has these user
              names defined, the quotas for these user names might be
              inadequate for VR_DA_APPL. If you are using the AVERTZ
              sample application, delete AVERTZ_EXC, AVERTZ_UPD, and
              AVERTZ_READ user names before running VR_DA_RUNTIME_
              SETUP.COM to ensure that you get appropriate quotas for
              these user names.

              To ensure the success of the operations in the VR_DA_
              RUNTIME_SETUP.COM command procedure, run it from the
              system account.

     6.3.3.4 Access Control List for the Avertz ACMS Sample

           The VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP.COM procedure adds the AVERTZ
           application name VR_DA_APPL to the ACMS database. The
           command line to do so includes the ACL qualifier and
           assigns the ID as /ID=SYSTEM. This might fail on your
           system.

           To ensure that the VR_DA_RUNTIME_SETUP.COM procedure
           works, change the ID=SYSTEM to ID=[UIC], where UIC is
           that of the account SYSTEM; for example, ID=[1,4].

     6.3.3.5 Rebuilding the Avertz ACMS Sample

           Executables are provided for the sample. You do not need
           to rebuild the sample to run it. However, a DEC/MMS
           description file is provided for rebuilding the sample
           to incorporate any changes you make to the sample.

           To modify and rebuild the sample, follow these steps:

           1. Copy the sample sources to another directory.

           2. Use the command procedure VR_DA_BLD_MMS.COM to
              rebuild the sample under a different ADB name in that
              directory:

              a. Create the CDD directories for the AVERTZ compo-
                 nents.

              b. Define logical names.

                 If you are using a directory other than ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_
                 AVERTZ for rebuilding the sample, edit the logical
                 name definitions in the VR_DA_BLD_LOGICALS.COM
                 command procedure to point to your file and CDD
                 directories. Make these edits before running the BLD
                 portion of the VR_DA_BLD_MMS.COM command procedure.

              c. Perform other setup and build activities.

           3. Run the command procedure VR_DA_BLD_MMS.COM without
              parameters:

              $ @ACMSDI$EXAMPLES:VR_DA_BLD_MMS

              All the setup and build activities are performed.

        6.4 Installing the Tru64 UNIX Client Software

              The TP Desktop Connector client services and sample
              application files are distributed on the Software Products
              Library CD and on the TPware Product Suite CD. If you are
              installing the software from the TPware Product Suite CD
              (see Section 6.1), you have archive (tar(1)) files that
              you install on a Tru64 UNIX desktop system. Perform the
              following steps.

              1. Create the client services directory on the desktop
                 system, and change to that directory. For example:

                 > mkdir acmsdi
                 > cd acmsdi

              2. Copy the archive file from the TPware CD to the client
                 services directory. For example:

                 > cp e:/dunix/du_client.tar .

              If you install the client files from the Software Products
              Library CD (see Section 3.2.2.3), change directory to the
              location of the tar files that you placed on the Tru64
              UNIX system.

              The du_client.tar archive file contains the client files.
              Perform the following steps.

              1. Extract the files from the archive. For example:

 the      TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems 6-23

 






              acmsdi> tar xvf du_client.tar
                 .
                 .
                 .

              The list of files printed because of the v flag should
              match the list of files in Table A-10.

           2. If you want to use the DECnet transport, change the
              client library. For example:

              > su
              # ar d libacmsdi.a net_tcpip.o
              # ar r libacmsdi.a net_decnet.o
              # ar t libacmsdi.a
                 .
                 .
                 .
              # ar qs libacmsdi.a

              Also edit the Makefile to add -ldnet to the link
              library list.

           3. You can copy the client services library to /usr/lib/libacmsdi.a,
              so that you can refer to it in your link command as '-
              lacmsdi'. You need superuser privileges to copy into
              the /usr/lib directory.

              Copy the TP Desktop Connector client library to the
              system directory:

              # cp libacmsdi.a /usr/lib/libacmsdi.a
                 .
                 .
                 .

              You can leave the TP Desktop Connector library in the
              client services directory. If you do, use the full path
              to the library in your link command, instead of using
              the '-lacmsdi' option.

           4. Update the copied library file:

              # ar qs /usr/lib/libacmsdi.a

              5. Exit superuser mode:

                 # <Ctrl/D>
                 >

              See Section 6.4.1 for instructions on installing sample
              files.

        6.4.1 Installing the Motif Sample Client on Tru64 UNIX
              Platforms

              To install the Motif sample files on the Tru64 UNIX
              system, perform the following steps:

              1. Create a directory on the desktop to contain the sample
                 files and move to that directory:

                 > mkdir avertz
                 > cd avertz

              2. Copy the sample archive from the TPware products CD:

                 > cp e:\dunix\du_avertz.tar .

              3. Extract the sample files:

                 > tar xvf du_avertz.tar
                    .
                    .
                    .

                 The list of files printed should match the list in
                 Table A-11.

              The sample makefile and executables for Motif on Tru64
              UNIX use TCP/IP as the default transport. If you have
              changed the client services library to use DECnet, you
              must relink the sample application before you run it.

        6.4.2 Verifying the Motif Sample Installation on Tru64 UNIX
              Platforms

              Compile, link, and run the source code for the sample
              client program to verify your capability to build
              applications. To build the sample application, follow
              these steps:

              1. Use the makefile provided to build the m_avertz sample
                 application. In the sample directory, run make:

 the      TP Desktop Connector Client Services on Non-Win32 Systems 6-25

 






              > make

           2. Run the application by entering the following command:

              > m_avertz

           The m_avertz application displays the menu bar of the
           AVERTZ Car Reservation System. If you want the sample
           desktop client program to communicate with the ACMS
           application, follow the procedures in Section 6.3.3 to set
           up the sample application on the ACMS system. After you
           set up the ACMS system, use the Session menu to sign in to
           the ACMS system. After you sign in, you can use the Rental
           menu to run the reserve task of the AVERTZ application.

           The installation procedure is now complete and verified.

                                                       Macintosh Systems



              This chapter describes the installation of the TP Desktop
              Connector client services and samples for Apple Macintosh
              clients.

              After you install the TP Desktop Connector gateway for
              ACMS software on the Compaq OpenVMS system, you can
              install the TP Desktop Connector client services software
              on individual desktop systems.

        7.1 Macintosh Installation Options

              You can choose any of several installation options
              depending on the type of services you want to install
              on the target Macintosh:

              o  Run-Time Services option

                 Permits the execution of TP Desktop Connector client
                 applications, but does not include files that are
                 helpful for developing new applications. You can
                 install Run-Time Services with or without the Calypso
                 Tool, which provides support for dialin applications to
                 the host ACMS Desktop server. Choose this option (with
                 or without Calypso) if you do not intend to develop
                 new TP Desktop Connector applications on the target
                 Macintosh.

              o  System Services option

                 Includes the Run-Time Services plus a set of files that
                 aids in the development of new TP Desktop Connector
                 client applications on the target Macintosh. This
                 option does not include the various examples that
                 illustrate the use of the TP Desktop Connector client
                 services. Choose the System Services option if you do

              o  Examples option

                 Includes the following:

                 -  Sample applications written in 4th Dimension,
                    HyperCard, and C.

                 -  Two sets of 4th Dimension Externals that invoke the
                    TP Desktop Connector client services, one of which
                    includes C source code to illustrate how to write
                    your own 4th Dimension Externals.

                 -  A set of HyperCard XFCNs that invoke the TP Desktop
                    Connector client services, including C source code.

                 -  A set of utility files containing C source code
                    for date and data conversion functions and programs
                    useful in managing your development platform.

                 You can install the Examples option separately, after
                 installing the Run-Time Services.

        7.2 Preparing to Install the Macintosh Software

              This section describes the preparations and requirements
              for installing the TP Desktop Connector client services
              software for Macintosh systems.

        7.2.1 Prerequisite Software for Macintosh Systems

              Before you install the software, do the following:

              1. Install TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS software
                 on the OpenVMS system running ACMS software.

              2. If you choose to use a VAXshare volume as the source
                 from which to copy the client software to your
                 Macintosh, identify a disk device on which to build
                 a VAXshare volume.

                 If you choose not to use a VAXshare volume as the
                 source from which to copy the client software:

                 a. Install a file transfer tool such as XMODEM or a
                    DECnet file server on your host OpenVMS system.

                 b. Install a corresponding file transfer tool such as
                    MacTerminal or NetCopy on the Macintosh.

        7.3 Installing the Macintosh Software

              This section describes how to install the TP Desktop
              Connector client services software for Macintosh on a
              Macintosh system.

        7.3.1 Copying the TP Desktop Connector Installer to the
              Macintosh

              All the files that comprise the TP Desktop Connector
              Macintosh client software are compacted into a single
              installation file, ACMSDI_DESKTOP.INSTALLER. The
              installation procedure consists of the following steps:

              1. Copy or FTP ACMSDI_DESKTOP.INSTALLER to the target
                 Macintosh.

              2. Double click the installer file.

              3. Follow the instructions that are displayed.

              The files on the TPware Product Suite and Software
              Products Library CDs are in MacBinary format. Many file
              transfer facilities such as NetCopy and MacTerminal
              automatically convert files from MacBinary to standard
              Macintosh format as part of the copy operation. If your
              file transfer utility does not automatically do so, use
              a tool such as MacBinary Converter (mBin) to convert the
              ACMSDI_DESKTOP.INSTALLER to standard Macintosh format
              after you copy it.

 the      TP Desktop Connector Client Services for Macintosh Systems 7-5

 






           After you have successfully copied the ACMSDI_DESKTOP.INSTALLER
           file to your Macintosh, proceed to Section 7.3.2.

     7.3.2 Running the TP Desktop Connector Macintosh Installer

           The ACMSDI_DESKTOP.INSTALLER file is a self-extracting
           file containing all the TP Desktop Connector Macintosh
           client services files in compressed form. During
           installation, files are automatically moved to the
           appropriate folders. The installation process provides
           instructions with each step:

           1. Begin the installation process by double clicking on
              the
              ACMSDI_DESKTOP.INSTALLER file.

           2. A window appears that identifies the product as TP
              Desktop Connector Version 2.3. Click on the Continue
              button.

           3. A second window appears containing a copyright notice.
              Read the copyright notice. Buttons are available
              to save or print the notice. You can cancel the
              installation at this point by clicking the Cancel
              button, in which case nothing is installed. Click
              the Continue button if you want to proceed with the
              installation.

           4. The next window provides some information about the
              installer. It tells you where the files to be installed
              will be placed and tells how much disk space is
              required for the (standard) full installation. The
              Calypso Tool mentioned is the software that enables
              serial (dialin) communication between TP Desktop
              Connector client applications and the host ACMS Desktop
              server.

              You have three buttons to choose from at this point:

              a. Custom button:

                 Allows you to proceed to another window where you
                 can choose which parts of the software you want to
                 install.

              b. Quit button:

                    Allows you to cancel the installation at this point;
                    nothing is installed.

                 c. Install button:

                    Causes a full installation to occur; everything is
                    installed.

                 If you want a standard, full installation, click the
                 Install button now, and skip to step 6. If you want to
                 examine additional options, click the Custom button and
                 proceed to step 5.

              5. If you choose a custom installation, a window appears
                 with six installation options. Text appears to describe
                 each option and how much disk storage it requires.
                 Section 7.1 presents a more complete description of the
                 installation options.

                 -  System Services, Calypso, and Examples: This option
                    installs everything. It is identical to the standard
                    installation presented on the previous window.

                 -  System Services: This option installs everything
                    except the examples and Calypso software.

                 -  System Services and Calypso: This option installs
                    everything except the examples.

                 -  Examples: This option installs the examples only.
                    Use it as a follow-up installation to a system
                    services or run-time services option with or without
                    Calypso.

                 -  Run-Time Services: This option installs only the
                    basic software needed for run-time support. The
                    development aids, the Examples and the Calypso
                    software are not installed.

                 -  Run-Time Services and Calypso: This option installs
                    the basic software needed for run-time support
                    and the Calypso software. The development aids and
                    examples are not installed.

                 You again have three buttons from which to choose:

                 a. Standard button:

                    Allows you to return to the standard installation
                    window.

              b. Quit button:

                 Allows you to cancel the installation at this point;
                 nothing is installed.

              c. Install button:

                 Cause an installation to occur. Before clicking on
                 this button, select one of the installation options
                 by clicking on it to highlight it.

           6. Clicking on the Install button from either the standard
              or custom installation window causes a window to appear
              from which you can select the location to place the
              folder "TP Desktop Connector folder (2.3)". All files
              except the DDEV and Calypso Tool are installed in
              this folder. Clicking the Cancel button cancels the
              installation, in which case nothing is installed.
              Clicking the Save button causes the installation to
              occur, as indicated by a progress window.

           7. If the installation is successful, a dialog box appears
              indicating success. From this window, you can quit or
              continue with additional installations.

              This chapter discusses the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing Compaq TP Desktop Connector
              gateway for ACMS software. Your bill of materials (BOM)
              and indented bills report (BIL) specify the number and
              contents of your media. Be sure to verify the contents of
              your kit with this information. If your kit is damaged or
              incomplete, contact your Compaq representative.

              The gateway software includes online Release Notes and
              gives you the option of printing or displaying them during
              the installation procedure. Compaq strongly recommends
              that you read the Release Notes before proceeding with the
              installation, in case they contain important information
              regarding the installation procedure.

        8.1 Required Operating System Components

              To install gateway software, you must have one of the
              following operating systems installed:

              OpenVMS VAX operating system

     8.2 Prerequisite Software

           The Software Product Description (SPD), a copy of which
           is included in the product kit, contains a list of
           the prerequisite software, and a complete list of the
           products that are compatible with this version of gateway
           software.

     8.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

           The installation procedure, VMSINSTAL, checks for various
           conditions on your system. If VMSINSTAL detects any
           problems during the installation, it notifies you of
           the problem and asks whether you want to continue the
           installation. In some instances, you can answer YES to
           continue. To stop the installation process and correct the
           situation, answer NO or press <Return> .

           You can avoid having to stop and restart VMSINSTAL by
           following the directions in this section before you
           run VMSINSTAL. The time required for installing gateway
           software is approximately five minutes.

     8.3.1 Disk Space

           Installing gateway software requires a certain amount
           of free storage space during the installation. Table 8-1
           summarizes the storage requirements for gateway software
           during and after installation.

           Table_8-1_Disk_Space_Requirements_________________________

                                         Blocks

           ______________________________Installation__Installation__

           Gateway_______________________23_304_________6_500________

           To determine the number of free disk blocks on the current
           system disk, enter the following command at the DCL
           prompt:

           $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

           In the output column under the heading Free Blocks is the
           number of 512-byte blocks available on the device.

        8.3.2 Privileges and Authorization

              To install gateway software, you must be logged in to an
              account with the following privileges:

                 NETMBX
                 SETPRV
                 TMPMBX

              The SYSTEM account has all the privileges you require for
              the installation.

              VMSINSTAL turns off the BYPASS privilege at the start of
              the installation and sets whatever privileges it needs
              during the installation.

              At the end of the installation procedure, if the gateway
              system components were installed, the gateway process on
              OpenVMS is started using the same user name that you use
              to install the product. Compaq recommends that you run the
              gateway under the user name SYSTEM or another user name
              with a [1,4] UIC.

              For the gateway process to be properly started, the
              user name under which the installation is done must be
              an authorized ACMS agent. Use the ACMSUDU Utility to
              authorize the user name. For example:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
              $ RUN ACMSUDU
              UDU> ADD SYSTEM/AGENT
              UDU>

              If the user name is not authorized as a ACMS agent, the
              IVP can fail and TP Desktop Connector client programs
              cannot sign in to the ACMS system. To allow client
              programs to successfully sign in to the ACMS system, stop
              the gateway, and restart it under a user name that is an
              authorized ACMS agent.

     8.3.3 OpenVMS License Management Facility

           The gateway supports the OpenVMS License Management
           Facility (LMF). To install gateway software on an OpenVMS
           system, you must register your software license.

           LMF requires registration of a Product Authorization Key
           (PAK). The license registration information you need
           is contained in the PAK that is shipped with gateway
           software. The PAK is a paper certificate that contains
           information about the license you have to run a particular
           piece of software.

           Register your gateway license before you perform the
           installation. During the installation, you are asked
           whether you have registered the gateway license and loaded
           the appropriate authorization key. You cannot run either
           the gateway software or its IVP unless your license is
           loaded. After you perform the license registration and
           load an authorization key, you can run the IVP and use the
           gateway software.

           To register a license, first log in to the system manager
           account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice of two ways to
           register:

           o  Run the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it
              prompts you for information, respond with data from
              your PAK.

           o  Issue the LICENSE REGISTER command with the appropriate
              qualifiers that correspond to information on the PAK.

           For complete information on using LMF, see VMS License
           Management Utility Manual.

     8.3.4 System Disk Backup

           At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks
           whether your system disk is backed up. Compaq recommends
           that you always do a system disk backup before installing
           new software on the operating system.

           Use the backup procedures that are established at your
           site to do this backup. For details on performing a system
           disk backup, see the section on the Backup Utility in the
           OpenVMS documentation set.

        8.3.5 Stopping the ACMS System and Gateway

              If you have TPware components already installed and
              running, shut them down. While logged in to the system
              under an account having the appropriate privileges
              as described in Section 8.3.2, execute the following
              commands.

              1. Stop the TP Web Connector Gateway for ACMS process. For
                 example:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSDI$SHUTDOWN
                 $

              2. If you have ACMS software already installed and
                 running, shut it down. Execute the following commands.

                 a. Stop the ACMS system. For example:

                    $  ACMS/STOP SYSTEM
                       .
                       .
                       .
                    $

                 b. Stop the ACMS controller. For example:

                    $  @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTOP
                       .
                       .
                       .
                    $

        8.3.6 Locating the Saveset Directory

              If you have not already inserted the compact disk (CD)
              media in the CD drive, do so now.

              To obtain the directory location of the saveset for the
              gateway software on the CD-ROM, refer to the OpenVMS
              Layered Products Compact Disc User's Guide, or, before
              starting the installation, complete these steps:

              1. To determine whether the CD-ROM drive is already
                 mounted (MOUNT command), enter a command in the
                 following format:

                 SHOW DEVICE device-name

 Preparing to Install TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software 8-5

 






           2. If the device is not mounted, enter a command in the
              following format:

              MOUNT/OVERRIDE=ID device-name

              For example:

              $ MOUNT/OVERRIDE=ID DKA200:

           3. Locate the distribution files. The directory-name
              depends on the OpenVMS platform, as follows:

              _______________________________________________________
              OpenVMS_Platform______Directory_Name___________________

              Alpha                 VMSALPHA

              VAX___________________VMSVAX___________________________

           4. To obtain the saveset name, use a DIRECTORY command in
              the following format and specify the saveset name from
              the previous command.

              DIRECTORY device-name:ACMSDIA031

               Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software



              This chapter describes how to install Compaq TP Desktop
              Connector gateway for ACMS software. Section 9.1 provides
              helpful information about installing the gateway software.
              Section 9.2 contains a step-by-step description of the
              installation procedure.

        9.1 General Installation Information

              This section includes the following information.

              o  Accessing Release Notes (see Section 9.1.1)

              o  Determining the files and logical names added to your
                 system (see Section 9.1.2)

              o  Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
                 (see Section 9.1.3)

              o  Aborting the installation (see Section 9.1.4)

        9.1.1 Accessing the Online Release Notes

              The gateway software provides online Release Notes.
              To activate the prompt about displaying or printing
              the Release Notes, invoke VMSINSTAL with the OPTIONS N
              parameter.

              After the gateway software has been installed, the Release
              Notes are located in a directory with public access.

     9.1.2 Files and Logical Names Installed on Your System

           The following files contain a list of the files added to
           your system by the gateway installation:

           SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.ACMSDI]ACMSDI$FIRST_FILES.DAT
           SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.ACMSDI]ACMSDI$SAMPLE_ADD_FILES.DAT
           SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.ACMSDI]ACMSDI$SAMPLE_AVERTZ_FILES.DAT
           SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.ACMSDI]ACMSDI$SAMPLE_COMMON_FILES.DAT
           SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.ACMSDI]ACMSDI$SAMPLE_EMPLOYEE_FILES.DAT
           SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.ACMSDI]ACMSDI$SAMPLE_MACINTOSH_FILES.DAT
           SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.ACMSDI]ACMSDI$SYSTEM_FILES.DAT

           You can display or print these files after you install the
           gateway software.

           After the installation, if the gateway is started (by
           ACMSDI$STARTUP.COM), the following logical names are added
           to your system:

           ACMSDI$EXAMPLES
           ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_ACMS
           ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_ADD
           ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ
           ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_EMPLOYEE
           ACMSDI_AVERTZ_DEFAULT
           AVERTZ_TDB

           These logical names are entered into the system logical
           name table. The names are used in various gateway startup
           files. Thus, they are automatically entered into the
           system logical name table whenever the gateway startup
           command file is executed.

     9.1.3 Installation Verification Procedure

           The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for
           gateway software verifies the installation. During the
           installation, you are asked whether you want to run
           the IVP as part of the installation. If you answer YES,
           VMSINSTAL runs the IVP. It is recommended that you run the
           IVP to be sure that the software is installed correctly.

           After you install the gateway software, you can run the
           IVP independently to verify that the software is available
           on your system. You might also want to run the IVP after
           a system failure to be sure that users can access gateway

              software. See Chapter 11 for information about running the
              IVP separately from the installation procedure.

        9.1.4 Aborting the Installation

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              <Ctrl/Y> . When you press <Ctrl/Y>, the installation
              procedure deletes all files it has created up to that
              point and exits. You can then start the installation
              again.

        9.2 Installation Procedure

              Perform the steps in the following sections to install the
              gateway software.

        9.2.1 Invoking VMSINSTAL

              Perform the following steps to start the installation
              process.

              1. Log to a privileged account (see Section 8.3.2 for
                 details) and set the default to the desired directory.
                 For example:

                 $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
                 $

                 SYS$UPDATE is used in this example.

              2. Use the following syntax to invoke VMSINSTAL:

                 @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name OPTIONS
        N

                 The parameter saveset-name represents the installation
                 name for the component. For the gateway software, use
                 the following installation name:

                 ACMSDIA

                 If you do not supply the saveset name, VMSINSTAL
                 prompts you for it later in the installation procedure.

                 The parameter device-name represents the location of
                 the saveset files (see Section 8.3.6). If you do not
                 supply device-name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this
                 information later in the installation procedure.

           Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software 9-3

 






              OPTIONS N is an optional parameter indicating that you
              want to be prompted to display or print the Release
              Notes. If you do not include the OPTIONS N parameter,
              VMSINSTAL does not prompt you to display or print the
              Release Notes.

              VMSINSTAL supports several other options. For
              information, refer to the OpenVMS documentation on
              software installation.

           3. Execute the installation procedure. For example:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL ACMSDIA DKA200[KIT]: OPTIONS N

              This command begins installing the ACMSDIA saveset
              found in the directory KIT on the CD device named
              DKA200.

           VMSINSTAL asks several installation questions as described
           in Section 9.2.2.

     9.2.2 Installation Questions

           This section discusses the questions that appear during
           the installation. Each question in the installation is
           marked with an asterisk (*)  at the beginning of the line.
           Some questions show the default response in brackets,
           for example, [YES]. To give the default response, press
           <Return> .

           1. Confirming active processes

              VMSINSTAL displays a list of all active processes.
              It then asks whether you want to continue the
              installation. Install the gateway software on a
              standalone system or cluster with DECnet shut down
              to minimize possible installation problems.

              %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
                 .
                 .
                 .
              * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?  YES

           2. Confirm system backup

     9-4 Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software

 






                 VMSINSTAL asks whether you are satisfied with your
                 system backup. Always back up your system disk before
                 performing an installation. If you are satisfied with
                 the backup of your system disk, press <Return> . Answer
                 NO to discontinue the installation. After you back up
                 your system disk, restart the installation.

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

              3. Mounting the media

                 VMSINSTAL now displays the CD device name and
                 asks whether you are ready to continue with the
                 installation.

                 Answer YES to indicate that the CD is mounted.
                 VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing
                 gateway software is mounted on the specified device and
                 that the installation is beginning. For example:

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on DKA200:.
                 * Are you ready? YES
                 %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, ACMSDI mounted on DKA200:

                 The following products will be processed:

                   ACMSDIA V3.1

                         Beginning installation of ACMSDIA V3.1 at 13:14

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set A...

                 If you enter the wrong device name when you invoke
                 VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, answer
                 NO in response to the Are you ready? question. See
                 Section 8.3.6 for instructions on mounting the CD.

                 To abort the installation for other reasons, press
                 <Ctrl/Y> .

              4. Release Notes

                 If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL,
                 you see several options for reviewing the Release
                 Notes. The following options are displayed:

           Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software 9-5

 






              Release Notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

              Additional Release Notes Options:

                  1. Display release notes
                  2. Print release notes
                  3. Both 1 and 2
                  4. None of the above

              * Select option [2]: 1

              o  Option 1

                 If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the
                 Release Notes immediately on the console terminal.
                 You can terminate the display at any time by
                 pressing <Ctrl/C> . Because the Release Notes
                 are several pages long, it is recommended that you
                 choose option 2 to print the Release Notes rather
                 than reviewing them on line.

              o  Option 2

                 If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts for the
                 name of the print queue to use:

                 * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                 Enter the name of an ANSI print queue on your
                 system, or press <Return> to send the file to the
                 default queue shown within the square brackets.

              o  Option 3

                 If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the
                 Release Notes and prompts for a queue name for the
                 printed version.

              o  Option 4

                 If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL continues the
                 installation.



     9-6 Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software

 






              5. Continuing the installation

                 The installation procedure asks whether you want to
                 continue the installation. To continue, answer YES.
                 Otherwise, press <Return> . In either case, the Release
                 Notes are copied to a file in the SYS$HELP directory.
                 For example:

                 * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES
                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's Release Notes have been moved to SYS$HELP.

                 © Digital Equipment Corporation. 1998. All Rights Reserved.

                 The name of the Release Notes file installed by
                 VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name and
                 version number. If you plan to compare previous
                 versions of gateway software, do not delete the Release
                 Notes for previous versions of the gateway.

              6. Choosing to purge files

                 You can purge files from previous versions of the
                 gateway that are superseded by this installation.
                 Purging is recommended, however, if you need to keep
                 files from a previous version, answer NO in response to
                 this question:

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

              7. Choosing to run the IVP

                 If you are installing the gateway system components,
                 the installation procedure asks whether you want to run
                 the IVP. The IVP checks that the software is installed
                 correctly. It is recommended that you run the IVP.

                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? YES

                 Press <Return> to run the IVP after installing gateway
                 software. Answer NO to omit the IVP. Run the IVP
                 independently after the installation to check the
                 consistency of the gateway software. See Chapter 11
                 for information about how to run the gateway IVP
                 independently of the installation procedure.

              8. Installing Macintosh sample code

           Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software 9-7

 






              You have the option of installing the gateway samples
              for the Macintosh platform.

              * Do you want to install the Macintosh sample [YES]? NO

              Press <Return> to load the server-side Macintosh sample
              application code in the [.MACINTOSH] subdirectory of
              the ACMSDI$EXAMPLES directory. Answer NO to omit the
              Macintosh sample code. Note that only the Macintosh
              samples are optional; the Add, Avertz, and Employee
              server-side sample files are installed automatically.

           9. Confirming license registration

              VMSINSTAL asks whether you have a PAK installed. You
              can install gateway software prior to registration;
              however, the software is unusable until you register
              the license.

               Looking up the Product Authorization Information.

                     Product:       TP-DESKTOP-ACMS
                     Producer:      DEC
                     Version:       3.1
                     Release Date:  18-AUG-1999

              * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded? YES

              If you answer NO, the installation completes but the
              IVP is not run. If you answer YES and the license is
              not registered, the IVP fails.

     9.2.3 Informational Messages

           At this point, the installation procedure displays a
           number of informational messages that report on the
           progress of the installation and advise about different
           uses of the product. There are no further questions.

              %ACMSDI-I-PROCEED, There are no further questions and all checks have been completed.
              -ACMSDI-I-PROCEED, It will take approximately 15 minutes to complete the
              installation.
              %VMSINSTAL-I-ACCOUNT, This installation updates an identifier named ACMSDI$CLIENT.
              %UAF-I-RDBMDFYMSG, identifier ACMSDI$CLIENT modified
                 .
                 .
                 .

              Read the instructions, because they might apply to your
              installation.

              If the installation procedure has been successful up to
              this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new or modified files
              to their target directories and updates help files. If
              you asked for files to be purged, that work is done. The
              following message is displayed:

                 .
                 .
                 .
              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories...
                 .
                 .
                 .

              If you are installing gateway software on a system
              disk that has limited free space, VMSINSTAL might not
              be operating in safety mode. In this case, VMSINSTAL
              processes all files immediately and does not display the
              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES... message.

              If the disk has quotas enabled, a message is displayed.
              The account must have sufficient disk quotas to install.
              Refer to Table 8-1.

        9.2.4 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              If you chose to run the IVP, VMSINSTAL runs it next. When
              the IVP runs successfully, you see the following messages
              displayed:

           The TP Desktop Connector V3.1 Gateway for ACMS IVP completed successfully

     9.2.5 Completing the Installation Procedure

           The following messages indicate that the installation
           procedure is complete:

             Installation of ACMSDIA V3.1 completed at 13:32

             VMSINSTAL procedure done at 13:33
           $

           You can now log out of the privileged account:

           $ LOGOUT
           SYSTEM     logged out at 04-JAN-1999 13:34:12.28

           VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process symbol
           tables during the installation. Therefore, to continue
           using the system account and restore these symbols, log
           out and log in again. Proceed to Chapter 10 to follow
           postinstallation procedures.

     9.3 Recovering from System and Installation Failures

           An unsuccessful installation can result from a system
           failure (see Section 9.3.1) or errors encountered during
           the installation procedure (see Section 9.3.2).

     9.3.1 System Failures

           If you experience a system failure, such as a power loss
           during installation, VMSINSTAL attempts to continue the
           installation when you reboot the system. Depending on the
           point in the installation at which the system fails, one
           of three conditions exists:

           o  The system disk did not undergo any changes before the
              system failure. VMSINSTAL instructs you to restart the
              installation.

     9-10 Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software

 






              o  The system disk used by the installation was corrupted.
                 VMSINSTAL instructs you to restore the system disk from
                 the backup copy and restart the installation.

              o  VMSINSTAL continues the installation and can tell you
                 to manually purge replaced files, even if you request
                 that they be purged automatically. You can purge files,
                 but remember that purging deletes all but the latest
                 version of all files on your system disk. If you have
                 multiple versions of system files to save, you can
                 delete just the gateway files you want to remove from
                 system directories.

                 To purge files, perform the following steps:

                 1. Reboot the system.

                 2. Log in to the SYSTEM account.

                 3. Purge all system files using the following command:

                    $ PURGE/LOG SYS$SYSROOT:[*...]*.*
                       .
                       .
                       .

                 After you perform this task, the installation is
                 complete.

              After you see the message that indicates the beginning
              of the IVP, the installation of the component software
              is complete. If the system fails subsequently, VMSINSTAL
              displays the following message when you reboot.

        %VMSINSTAL-I-RECOVER, TP Desktop Gateway for ACMS was being installed when the system crashed.

        The installation completed satisfactorily.

              This message indicates that VMSINSTAL finished suc-
              cessfully, not that the installation of the gateway was
              successful.

              VMSINSTAL does not automatically restart the IVP. Run
              the IVP independently by following the steps described in
              Chapter 11.

     9.3.2 Installation Failures

           If the installation of the gateway software or a TP
           Desktop Connector sample application fails for some reason
           other than a system failure, the installation procedure
           displays a message describing the cause of the failure.
           To continue with the installation, correct the condition
           causing the error and restart the installation procedure
           from the beginning.

           Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
           following conditions exist:

           o  The operating system version is incorrect.

           o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

           o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
              insufficient.

           o  System parameter values for successful installation are
              insufficient.

           o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

           For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
           conditions, see the OpenVMS documentation on system
           messages, recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software
           installations. If you are notified that any of these
           conditions exist, take the appropriate action as described
           in the message. (You might need to change a system
           parameter or increase a quota value.) For information
           on installation requirements, see Chapter 8.

           If the installation of the component software completes
           satisfactorily, but a test fails during the IVP, the IVP
           displays a message describing the failure and suggests a
           course of action.

           In most cases, the suggested course of action is to
           reinstall the gateway software. If the IVP fails after
           you reinstall the gateway software, contact your Compaq
           software specialist.

        9.3.3 IVP Error Recovery

              As the IVP executes, it checks the success of each test
              and operation it performs. If any test or operation fails,
              the IVP displays a message describing the failure and
              suggests a course of action.

              Follow the suggested course of action and then restart the
              IVP as described in Chapter 11. If you reinstall gateway
              software, the IVP runs automatically if you answer YES to
              the IVP question. If you still cannot successfully run the
              IVP, contact your Compaq software specialist.

         After Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software



              After installing gateway software from the Gateway CD,
              perform the following tasks:

              o  Edit OpenVMS system startup and shutdown files (see
                 Section 10.1).

              o  Perform any cluster operations (see Section 10.2).

              o  Match client and server versions (see Section 10.3).

              o  Read the management chapters in the appropriate
                 document:

                 -  Compaq TP Desktop Connector for ACMS Client
                    Application Programming Guide

                 -  Compaq TP Desktop Connector Getting Started

              See Chapter 11 for information about how to run the
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) after the
              software has been installed.

        10.1 Editing the OpenVMS System Files

              You must edit the OpenVMS system startup and shutdown
              files to provide for automatic startup and shutdown of TP
              Desktop software when your system is rebooted. (This step
              is usually not necessary for system upgrades.)

        10.1.1 Editing the System Startup File

              The following files are located in the SYS$STARTUP
              directory.

              ACMSDI$SHUTDOWN.COM
              ACMSDI$STARTUP.COM

    After Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software 10-1

 






           Add to the OpenVMS system startup file the command line
           that starts TP Desktop. If you separate the startup
           procedures into modules, be sure that you add the lines to
           the correct file.

           Position the TP Desktop startup command line after the
           line that invokes the ACMS startup command procedure. For
           example:

           $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTART.COM
              .
              .
              .
           $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSDI$STARTUP.COM

              ________________________Note ________________________

              Start ACMS software before you start TP Desktop
              software.

              _____________________________________________________

           Starting TP Desktop software automatically enables the use
           of the DECnet communication transport. To use NetWare or
           TCP/IP protocols as well, or instead of DECnet, list the
           transports you want to use in a parameter file. Specify
           the parameter file as a qualifier on the TP Desktop
           startup command line.

           The parameter file is a simple ASCII text file that lists
           customer overrides to TP Desktop run-time quotas and
           defaults. These overrides can include the specification
           of the communication libraries that have been installed
           on the OpenVMS system. For example, to enable TP Desktop
           to use all transports, create the following file in the
           SYS$MANAGER directory:

           ACMS_DESKTOP_SERVER.DAT

           Include in the file the following line:

           transport=(tcpip,netware,decnet,appletalk)

           Modify the startup command line to specify the parameter
           file. For example:

           $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSDI$STARTUP.COM SYS$MANAGER:ACMS_DESKTOP_SERVER.DAT

     10-2 After Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software

 






              To perform this same function in batch from DCL-level,
              issue a SUBMIT command. For example:

              $ SUBMIT/USER=SYSTEM/NOLOG SYS$STARTUP:ACMSDI$STARTUP-
              _$ /PARAMETER=(SYS$MANAGER:ACMS_DESKTOP_SERVER.DAT)

              This command starts a batch job that runs the startup
              command procedure using the input file specified in the
              parameter qualifier. When the batch job completes, the TP
              Desktop software is started.

        10.1.2 Editing the System Shutdown File

              Find the following line, which stops the ACMS system, in
              the OpenVMS system shutdown file:

              $ @ACMSTOP.COM

              At some point before this line, add the following command
              line:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSDI$SHUTDOWN.COM

              The command procedure cancels all active tasks and shuts
              down the TP Desktop process. This ensures that the TP
              Desktop system processes are run down properly. The
              command procedure also deinstalls TP Desktop images (using
              the Install Utility of OpenVMS) and deassigns the logical
              names.

        10.2 Performing Cluster Procedures

              Because TP Desktop software treats a VAXcluster or
              VMScluster system as if it were a local area network
              (LAN), you must prepare system-specific roots on each
              node of the cluster. For example:

              $ CREATE/DIRECTORY SYS$SPECIFIC:[ACMSDI]/OWNER_UIC=SYSTEM-
              _$  /PROTECTION=(S:RWE,O:RWE,G:RE,W:RE)
              $ CREATE/DIRECTORY SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSTEST.ACMSDI]/OWNER_UIC=SYSTEM-
              _$  /PROTECTION=(S:RWE,O:RWE,G:RE,W:RE)
              $ CREATE/DIRECTORY SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.ACMSDI]/OWNER_UIC=SYSTEM-
              _$  /PROTECTION=(S:RWE,O:RWE,G:RE,W:RE)
              $

    After Installing TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS Software 10-3

 






           Executed on each node in the cluster, these commands
           create directory roots for the TP Desktop software. See
           Section 9.1.2 for the locations of files describing the
           directories added to your system.

     10.3 Matching Client and Server Versions

           If you are upgrading from ACMS Desktop Version 2.n to
           TP Desktop Version 3.m, you can use your existing client
           programs with the new server. But, if you build a new
           client program under TP Desktop Version 3.m, you cannot
           use this new program with the old ACMS Desktop Version 2.n
           server.

           When the ACMS communication protocols do not match those
           of the desktop client, the gateway rejects the attempted
           connection. The gateway writes a message to the software
           event log (SWL).

           The error code returned on the client side depends on
           the nature of the mismatch. The following error codes can
           indicate a mismatched condition:

           ACMSDI_SRVDEAD      -3020
           ACMSDI_INVPROTOCOL  -3025

                   Running the TP Desktop Connector Gateway for ACMS IVP



              This chapter describes how to run the gateway installation
              verification procedure (IVP) separately from the
              installation procedure. The IVP can be run as a part of
              the normal installation when you answer YES to the IVP
              question. If the IVP fails for any reason, correct the
              error and rerun the IVP. See Chapter 9 for information
              on providing the IVP with information required for
              the installation procedure. Run separately from the
              installation procedure, the IVP can check the integrity of
              installed files on the system.

        11.1 IVP Operations

              The IVP checks that:

              1. The installation procedure successfully completed
                 installing TP Desktop software.

              2. The installed software can be used to set up and run TP
                 Desktop software.

              3. All the necessary files are on the system.

              The IVP does not check that the applications run
              correctly.

        11.2 Running the IVP Independently

              This section describes the requirements and steps to run
              the IVP.

     11.2.1 IVP Requirements

           If disk quotas are enabled, the IVP cannot run. The
           procedure checks to see whether disk quotas are enabled
           just after checking the process quotas. If disk quotas are
           enabled, the procedure provides an informational message
           to that effect and terminates.

     11.2.2 IVP Steps

           To run the IVP independently of the installation
           procedure, follow these steps:

           1. Log in to the SYSTEM account:

              Username: SYSTEM
              Password:

           2. Set your default to the test directory:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$TEST
              $

           3. Run the IVP using the following file specification:

              ACMSDI$IVP.COM

              You can run the IVP only on your current booted system.
              You cannot run the IVP over a networked connection.

           To start the IVP, enter the following command:

           $ @ACMSDI$IVP
           The TP Desktop Connector V3.1 Gateway for ACMS IVP completed successfully
              .
              .
              .
           The TP Desktop Connector V3.1 Gateway for ACMS IVP completed successfully

           The IVP takes no more than 30 seconds to run, depending on
           the current system load.

        11.2.3 IVP Error Recovery

              As the IVP executes, it checks the success of each test
              and operation it performs. If any test or operation fails,
              the IVP does the following:

              1. Stops processing.

              2. Displays a message describing the failure.

              3. Suggests a course of action to eliminate the cause of
                 the failure.

              Follow the suggested course of action and then restart the
              IVP.

                                             Common Configuration Errors



              The following sections discuss some of the errors that
              can occur while running the TP Desktop Connector client
              services sample applications.

        B.1 Errors Related to the Desktop System

              Errors can arise when any of the following conditions
              exits:

              o  The TP Desktop Connector client program node does not
                 have the network software functioning correctly.

              o  The TP Desktop Connector client program node does not
                 have the network in the directory search path.

              o  The TP Desktop Connector client program node has
                 insufficient disk space.

        B.1.1 Errors on DOS or Windows 3.11 Desktops

              Problems might be caused by a faulty startup or configura-
              tion file. Example B-1 shows a sample startup.bat file.

              Example B-1 Sample startup.bat File

              path=c:\;c:\PWV51;c:\dos;c:\MSVC\bin;c:\windows;c:\windev;c:\acmsdi mouse set
              lib=c:\MSVC\lib;c:\windev\lib;c:\acmsdi;c:\decnet\src set
              include=c:\MSVC\include;c:\windev\include;o:\acmsdi;c:\decnet\src set
              helpfiles=c:\MSVC\help\*.hlp set init=c:\MSVC\init






                                         Common Configuration Errors B-1

 






           Example B-2 shows a sample config.sys file.


           Example B-2 Sample config.sys File

           files= 30
           buffers=10
           device=C:\himem.sys
           shell=\command.com /P /e:1024
           device=C:\WINDOWS\smartdrv.sys 2048 1024
           lastdrive=z

           Use the samples as guidelines to finding and fixing the
           problem.

     B.1.2 Errors on OpenVMS Desktops

           If errors occur in running the Motif Avertz program,
           verify the following:

           o  The m_avertz.uid file is in the directory from which
              you run the m_avertz application.

           o  The m_avertz.dat file (your resources file) is located
              in your home directory.

           If you encounter font-support problems running the
           program, you can modify the fonts used by editing the
           m_avertz resources file (m_avertz.dat in the user's home
           directory).

     B.1.3 Errors on Tru64 UNIX Desktops

           If errors occur in running the Motif Avertz program,
           verify the following:

           o  The m_avertz.uid file is in the directory from which
              you run the m_avertz application.

           o  The m_avertz file (your resources file) is located in
              your home directory.

           If you are installing this application once for use by
           many users, make sure that the users copy m_avertz to
           their home directories.

           If you encounter font-support problems running the
           program, modify the fonts used by editing the m_avertz
           resources file (m_avertz in the user's home directory).

        B.2 Errors Related to the ACMS System

              If you have used the client services sample to communicate
              with the ACMS system, errors will occur if any of the
              following conditions exists:

              o  The TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS system
                 directory ACMSDI$EXAMPLES, ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_AVERTZ, or
                 ACMSDI$EXAMPLES_ADD is protected against read access.

              o  The TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS system does
                 not have the sample files installed.

              o  The TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS system does
                 not have the network software functioning correctly.

              o  The TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS system is
                 unavailable.

              o  The TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS system name
                 is invalid.

              o  The TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS system is not
                 running the ACMS software.

              o  The TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS system has
                 not invoked ACMSDI$STARTUP.COM and ACMS/START SYSTEM.

              o  The TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS software is
                 not installed or is improperly installed.

              o  The TP Desktop Connector gateway for ACMS system IVP
                 failed.
