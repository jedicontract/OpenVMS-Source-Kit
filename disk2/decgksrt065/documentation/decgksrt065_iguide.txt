                                   Preparing for DIGITAL GKS Installation


              This chapter describes the preparations and requirements
              for installing DIGITAL GKS Version 6.5. This chapter will
              help you determine the following:

              o  Whether the system on which you will install DIGITAL GKS
                 has the prerequisite software installed

              o  How to read the online release notes

              o  If installing DIGITAL GKS from media, whether your
                 distribution kit includes all the components listed
                 on the Bill of Materials (BOM)

              o  How to register a software license

              o  The privileges required to perform the installation

              o  How much disk space you will need

              o  Whether the global pages and sections parameters are
                 defined properly

              o  Whether the user account quotas are defined correctly

              o  How to back up your system disk

        1.1 Prerequisite Software

              The software requirements for DIGITAL GKS Version 6.5 are:

              o  OpenVMS VAX operating system Version 5.5-2 or higher

              o  DEC C/DEC C++ Run-time Library Components Version 6.0
                 for OpenVMS VAX

              Additional software requirements are:

              For workstations running VWS:

                 OpenVMS VAX Workstation Software Version 4.4

                               Preparing for DIGITAL GKS Installation 1-1

 







          For workstations running OpenVMS VAX DECwindows:

          DECwindows is packaged with the operating system;
          therefore, no additional DECwindows software components
          are necessary.

          For workstations running OpenVMS VAX DECwindows Motif:

             DECwindows Motif Version 1.1 or higher for OpenVMS VAX

          DIGITAL GKS also requires the following OpenVMS VAX classes
          for full functionality:

          o  OpenVMS VAX required save set

          o  Network support-where full DECwindows network
             functionality is necessary




























    1-2 Preparing for DIGITAL GKS Installation

 







              o  Programming support-required by the DIGITAL GKS
                 development kit

              o  OpenVMS VAX workstation support-if you are using DIGITAL
                 GKS on a workstation

              For the development of application programs that use
              DIGITAL GKS under OpenVMS VAX, one of the DIGITAL GKS
              supported languages is also required.

        1.2 Online Release Notes

              DIGITAL GKS provides online release notes. DIGITAL strongly
              recommends that you read the release notes before using
              DIGITAL GKS, because they may contain information about
              product changes.

              During installation, you can access release notes in the
              installation procedure when you invoke VMSINSTAL with the
              OPTIONS N parameter. This option lets you read or print the
              release notes before installing DIGITAL GKS.

              After installation, you can obtain the DIGITAL GKS release
              notes for the development or run-time-only kit by printing
              the following files:

              o  SYS$HELP:DECGKS065.RELEASE_NOTES (ASCII format)

              o  SYS$HELP:DECGKS065_RELEASE_NOTES.PS (PostScript[R]
                 format)

        1.3 Media Distribution Kit

              Your bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report
              (BIL) specify the number and contents of your media.
              Be sure to check the contents of your kit against this
              information. If your kit is damaged or if you find
              that parts of it are missing, contact your DIGITAL
              representative. For more information on how to mount
              distribution media, see your processor-specific
              installation/operations guide, which also details several
              options for the installation procedure.

    1.4 License Registration

          Before you install and run DIGITAL GKS Version 6.5 on a
          newly licensed node or cluster, you must first register
          a License Product Authorization Key (License PAK) using
          the License Management Facility (LMF). The PAK is a paper
          certificate that contains information about the license
          that enables you to use the software. The License PAK is
          shipped with the kit if you ordered the license and media
          together; otherwise, the PAK is shipped separately to the
          location specified on your license order.

          If you are installing DIGITAL GKS as an update on a
          node or cluster already licensed for this software,
          you have already completed the License PAK registration
          requirements. If you are installing prerequisite or
          optional software along with DIGITAL GKS, review the
          PAK status and install the PAKs for this prerequisite or
          optional software before you install DIGITAL GKS.

          To register a license under the OpenVMS VAX operating
          system, first log in to the system manager's account,
          SYSTEM. You can then register the license in one of two
          ways:

          o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it
             prompts you for information, respond with the data from
             your License PAK.

          o  Enter the LICENSE REGISTER command with the qualifiers
             corresponding to the License PAK information.

          If you plan to use DIGITAL GKS on more than one node in
          a VAXcluster[TM] configuration, you will need to perform
          a license load on the other nodes after you complete this
          installation. See Section 3.1 for details.

          For complete information on using LMF, see the OpenVMS
          License Management Utility Manual.

    1.5 Installation Procedure Requirements

          The following sections describe the various requirements
          for installing DIGITAL GKS. The installation takes
          approximately 5 to 30 minutes, depending on your system
          configuration.

        1.5.1 Privileges

              To install DIGITAL GKS, you must be logged in to an account
              that has the SETPRV privilege, or at least the following
              privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

              When you invoke VMSINSTAL to begin the installation
              procedure, VMSINSTAL turns off the BYPASS privilege.

              After installation, each user account must have at least
              the TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges to use DIGITAL GKS. Use
              the OpenVMS Authorize Utility to determine whether users
              have the privileges they require.

        1.5.2 Disk Space

              The DIGITAL GKS requirements for free disk storage space
              are different during installation and after installation.
              Table 1-1 summarizes these requirements.

             _______________________ Caution _______________________

             You must ensure that your system has the necessary
             global page and global section SYSGEN quotas for the
             installation. Otherwise, the DCL tables may become
             corrupted in certain situations.

             ______________________________________________________

    1.5.3 Global Pages and Global Sections System Parameters

          The installation of DIGITAL GKS requires minimum values
          for the system parameters that define the global pages
          and global sections. These values are shown in Table 1-2.
          Depending on the kinds of programs and applications running
          at your site, you may need to define larger values.

          that are currently in use. To install DIGITAL GKS, you
          must increase those values by the number indicated. (See
          Section 1.5.3.3 and Section 1.5.3.4.)
          These dynamic system parameters must be set permanently to
          values equal to or greater than the values listed. Do not
          decrease these values after the installation.
          ___________________________________________________________

          The following sections describe how to:

          o  Determine the number of global pages and global sections
             available

          o  Determine the global pages and global sections used

          o  Modify the global pages parameter

          o  Modify the global sections parameter

          o  Recalculate the global pages and global sections
             parameters to take the new values into account

    1-6 Preparing for DIGITAL GKS Installation

 







        1.5.3.1 Determining the Global Pages and Global Sections
                Available

              You can determine the available global pages and global
              sections using the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical
              function. The following example shows how to display this
              information on your terminal (the default for SYS$OUTPUT):

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES") <Return>
              15848
              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS") <Return>
              24

              If the values displayed by the system are greater than the
              values in Table 1-2, you do not need to increase the values
              for these parameters. If the values of free global pages
              or global sections are less than the values in Table 1-2,
              you must increase the parameter values, as described in the
              following sections.

              You can also determine the number of global sections
              available using the following procedure:

              1. Invoke the SYSGEN Utility:

                 $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN <Return>
                 SYSGEN> USE CURRENT <Return>

              2. Determine the number of global sections available:

                 SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS <Return>

 Parameter Name             Current   Default   Minimum   Maximum Unit  Dynamic
 --------------             -------   -------   -------   ------- ----  -------
 GBLSECTIONS                    400       250        20      4095 Sections

                 The first number displayed is the current number of
                 global sections. Compare this number to the number of
                 global sections in use displayed by the OpenVMS Install
                 Utility (see Section 1.5.3.2).

              3. Exit from the SYSGEN Utility:

                 SYSGEN> EXIT <Return>

                               Preparing for DIGITAL GKS Installation 1-7

 







    1.5.3.2 Determining the Global Pages and Global Sections Used

          To determine the global pages and global sections used:

          1. Invoke the OpenVMS Install Utility:

             $ INSTALL :== $INSTALL/COMMAND_MODE <Return>
             $ INSTALL <Return>

          2. Determine the number of global pages used:

             INSTALL> LIST/GLOBAL/SUMMARY <Return>

                     Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

             nn Global Sections Used,  nnnn/nnnn Global Pages Used/Unused

             INSTALL> EXIT <Return>

             The system displays a summary of the number of global
             sections used, the number of global pages used, and the
             number of global pages available.

          3. Exit from the OpenVMS Install Utility:

             INSTALL> EXIT <Return>

    1.5.3.3 Modifying the Global Pages Parameter

          To modify the number of global pages:

          1. If there are fewer than 4000 global pages available,
             modify the GBLPAGES system parameter.

             You can modify the GBLPAGES parameter by editing the
             SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file. To change a parameter
             value in this file, delete the current value and enter
             the new value. (Another way of allocating space is to
             delete an existing known image with the OpenVMS Install
             Utility.)

             To modify GBLPAGES, use ADD_GBLPAGES as shown, where n
             is the number of global pages to add:

             ADD_GBLPAGES = n

             Note that when you set the page file quota, you should
             not use a value that exceeds the amount of page file
             space available on the system.

          2. Exit the editor.

    1-8 Preparing for DIGITAL GKS Installation

 







              3. Update the GBLPAGES parameter by invoking the AUTOGEN
                 command procedure described in Section 1.5.3.5.

        1.5.3.4 Modifying the Global Sections Parameter

              To modify the number of global sections:

              1. If the number of global sections in use plus 30 exceeds
                 the current number of global sections, modify the
                 GBLSECTIONS parameter.

                 You can modify the GBLSECTIONS parameter by editing the
                 SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file. To change a parameter
                 value in this file, delete the current value and enter
                 the new value.

                 To modify GBLSECTIONS, use ADD_GBLSECTIONS as shown,
                 where n is the number of global sections to add:

                 ADD_GBLSECTIONS = n

                 Note that when you set the page file quota, you should
                 not use a value that exceeds the amount of page file
                 space available on the system.

              2. Exit the editor.

              3. Update the GBLSECTIONS parameter by invoking the AUTOGEN
                 command procedure described in Section 1.5.3.5.

        1.5.3.5 Recalculating the Global Pages and Global Sections
                Parameters

              To update the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS parameters, invoke
              the AUTOGEN command procedure, SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT <Return>

              AUTOGEN automatically recalculates the parameters with
              the values you defined manually. When you specify REBOOT,
              AUTOGEN performs an automatic system shutdown and then
              reboots the system. Any users logged on to the system are
              immediately disconnected during the shutdown.

              AUTOGEN also automatically adjusts some of the SYSGEN
              parameters, based on the consumption of resources since
              the last reboot. If you do not want to take advantage of
              this automatic adjustment, include the NOFEEDBACK qualifier
              on the AUTOGEN command line.

          For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the OpenVMS
          System Management Subkit.

    1.5.4 User Account Quotas

          The account you use to install DIGITAL GKS requires certain
          minimum user account values. These values, which are
          defined in the SYSUAF.DAT file, are listed in Table 1-3.

              Using the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE), you
              can compare the current values of these quotas with the
              requirements for DIGITAL GKS. The account used in the
              following example is the SYSTEM account:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

              To change the values of these quotas, use the MODIFY
              command. For more information, see the OpenVMS System
              Management Utilities Reference Manual.

        1.6 Backing Up Your System Disk

              DIGITAL recommends that you back up your system disk before
              installing any software. Use the backup procedures that
              are established at your site. For details on performing
              a backup, see the section on the Backup Utility in the
              OpenVMS System Management Subkit.

                                                   Installing DIGITAL GKS


              This chapter describes the DIGITAL GKS installation
              procedure. For a list of the files and directories created
              during the installation procedure, see Appendix A. For
              sample development kit and run-time-only installations,
              refer to Appendix B.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              exits. You can then start the installation again.

        2.1 Installation Procedure

              Before you install DIGITAL GKS, DIGITAL recommends that
              you back up your system disk. Once you have done so,
              you can begin the installation. The installation takes
              approximately 5 to 30 minutes, depending on your system
              configuration.

              You should not install DIGITAL GKS run-time-only Version
              6.5 if you have already installed the full development kit
              of DIGITAL GKS Version 6.5. If you do, the installation
              procedure will overwrite the development kit with the run-
              time-only kit. To determine which version of DIGITAL GKS is
              currently installed, enter the following DCL command:

    $ ANALYZE/IMAGE/INTERACTIVE/HEADER SYS$LIBRARY:[SYSLIB]GKS3D$RTLIB <Return>

              Look for lines similar to the following in the resulting
              display:

                                              .
                                              .
                                              .
                                              .

                                          .

          The procedure for installing DIGITAL GKS is:

          1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
             device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

             DIGITAL recommends that you use the system manager's
             account.

             Username: SYSTEM <Return>
             Password:         <Return>
             $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <Return>

              2. Define the destination for the output of the
                 Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) with the
                 following command, replacing node with your node name:

                 The IVP verifies the integrity of the installation. In
                 the following command, node is your node name.

                 $ DEFINE DECW$DISPLAY node::0.0 <Return>

              3. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

                 When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

                 o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account.
                    You should install software from the system manager's
                    account with your default device and directory set to
                    SYS$UPDATE.

                 o  The installing account has adequate:

                       Disk space
                       Global pages
                       Global sections
                       Account quotas

                 o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
                    VMSINSTAL requires the following minimum quota
                    values:

                       ASTLM = 24
                       BIOLM = 18
                       BYTLM = 18000
                       DIOLM = 18
                       ENQLM = 30
                       FILLM = 20

                 o  Whether the following conditions exist:

                    -  DECnet[TM] network is up and running.

                    -  Users are logged in to the system.

                 If VMSINSTAL detects problems, you will be asked whether
                 you want to continue the installation. You should
                 correct these problems before resuming the installation
                 procedure. If you want to continue, enter YES. If you
                 want to stop the installation, press Return.

                 To invoke the VMSINSTAL command procedure, enter:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name OPTIONS N <Return>

                                               Installing DIGITAL GKS 2-3

 







             The VMSINSTAL parameters are:

             saveset-name
             The installation name for the component. For the DIGITAL
             GKS development kit, use the name:

             DECGKS065

             For the DIGITAL GKS run-time-only kit, use the name:

             DECGKSRT065

             device-name
             The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
             distribution volumes for the DIGITAL GKS installation
             media. The format of the device name is ddcu, where dd
             is the device code, c is the controller code, and u is
             the unit number. For example, DKA400 is the device name
             for a CD-ROM.

             For CD-ROM media, you must also supply the directory
             location of the DIGITAL GKS save set on the CD-ROM. To
             obtain this location, see the Software Product Library
             CD-ROM User's Guide booklet that accompanies the CD-ROM
             distribution kit, or complete the following steps before
             starting the installation:

             a. Determine whether the CD-ROM drive is already mounted
                by entering the command:

                $ SHOW DEVICE DKA400: <Return>

                If the device is mounted, skip to the next step.
                If it is not mounted, enter the appropriate MOUNT
                command to mount the CD-ROM, omitting the /FOREIGN
                qualifier.

             b. Obtain the directory name by entering the command:

                $ DIRECTORY DKA400:[000000]*decgks*.dir <Return>

                The directory name will be displayed; for example:

                Directory DKA400:[000000]

                DECGKS065.DIR;1          (development kit)

                DECGKSRT065.DIR;1        (run-time-only kit)

    2-4 Installing DIGITAL GKS

 







                 c. Obtain the save set name by using a DIRECTORY command
                    specifying the directory file from the previous
                    command. For example, for the development kit, enter:

                    $ DIRECTORY DKA400:[DECGKS065.KIT]*.A <Return>

                    For the run-time-only kit, enter:

                    $ DIRECTORY DKA400:[DECGKSRT065.KIT]*.A <Return>

                 OPTIONS N
                 An optional parameter that enables you to access the
                 release notes. If you do not include the OPTIONS N
                 parameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about the release
                 notes. You should review the release notes before
                 proceeding with the installation, because they contain
                 additional information about the installation.

                 Note that there are several other options you can select
                 when you invoke VMSINSTAL:

                 o  Auto_answer option (A)

                    This option initially creates a file that contains
                    your answers to VMSINSTAL questions and prompts.
                    You can then use the option (and the answer file) to
                    save time during a reinstallation (typically after
                    upgrading your system).

                 o  Get save set option (G)

                    This option lets you temporarily store product save
                    sets on a magnetic tape or in a disk directory.

             o  File log option (L)

                This option logs all activity to the terminal during
                installation.

             o  Alternate root option (R)

                This option lets you install the product to a system
                root other than that of the current system.

             If you do not supply the save set and device
             names, VMSINSTAL prompts you for them later in the
             installation. VMSINSTAL does not prompt you for any
             options, however, so be sure to include the desired
             options on the VMSINSTAL command line. If you specify
             more than one option, separate the options with commas
             (for instance, OPTIONS A,N). See the documentation on
             software installation in the OpenVMS System Management
             Subkit for detailed information on these options.

             The following example invokes VMSINSTAL to install
             DIGITAL GKS development kit from a CD-ROM and shows
             the system response:

   $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DECGKS065 DKA400:[DECGKS065.KIT] OPTIONS N <Return>

                   VAX/VMS Software Product Installation Procedure V5.5-2

             It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
             Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

             If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the
             installation, it notifies you and asks if you want to
             continue the installation. In some instances, you can
             enter YES to continue. To stop the installation process
             and correct the situation, enter NO or press Return.
             Then, correct the problem and restart the installation.

          4. Check the status of your processes.

             If DECnet software is running, VMSINSTAL displays a list
             of all active processes and asks if you want to continue
             the installation:

             %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
                .
                .
                .
             * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]? <Return>

    2-6 Installing DIGITAL GKS

 







                 You should install DIGITAL GKS on a standalone system
                 or cluster with DECnet shut down; therefore, NO is the
                 default response to the question.

              5. Confirm system backup.

       * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? <Return>

                 You should always back up your system disk before
                 performing an installation. If you are satisfied with
                 the backup of your system disk, press Return. Otherwise,
                 enter NO and press Return to stop the installation.
                 After you back up your system disk, you can restart the
                 installation.

              6. Mount the media.

                 If you omitted the device name on the VMSINSTAL command
                 line, the following prompt appears:

         * Where will the distribution volume be mounted: DKA400: <Return>

                 Enter the name of the distribution media device and
                 directory that contains the DIGITAL GKS save sets. For
                 example, if the media is contained on a CD-ROM located
                 on unit DKA400:, and the DIGITAL GKS save set is located
                 in the directory DECGKS065.KIT, enter:

                 DKA400:[DECGKS065.KIT]

                 Depending on the type of device and whether the device
                 is already mounted, the following may or may not appear:

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on DKA400:.
                 * Are you ready? Y <Return>

                 If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
                 VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, enter
                 NO in response to the "Are you ready?" question. If you
                 respond YES to indicate that you are ready, VMSINSTAL
                 indicates that the media containing DIGITAL GKS has been
                 mounted, and then prompts for the product name and any
                 desired installation options:

          7. Select a release notes option.

             This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N when
             starting the installation.

             Release Notes Options:

                 1.  Display release notes
                 2.  Print release notes
                 3.  Both 1 and 2
                 4.  None of the above

             * Select option [2]: 1 <Return>

             If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
             notes immediately on the console terminal. You can
             terminate the display at any time by pressing Ctrl/C.

                 If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a
                 queue name. Either enter a queue name or press Return to
                 send the file to the default output print device:

                 * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

                 If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes on the terminal and then prompts you for a queue
                 name for the printed version. After you enter a queue
                 name or press Return to send the file to the default
                 output print device, the release notes are copied to:

                 o  SYS$HELP:DECGKS065.RELEASE_NOTES

                 o  SYS$HELP:DECGKS065_RELEASE_NOTES.PS

                 If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL does not display,
                 print, or copy the release notes.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                This version of the release notes file installed by
                VMSINSTAL is labeled with the current product name and
                version number. Be sure not to delete release notes
                for previous versions of DIGITAL GKS.

                ______________________________________________________

                 VMSINSTAL then displays the following prompt:

    * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: Y <Return>
    %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to SYS$HELP.

                 To continue the installation, enter YES and press
                 Return. Otherwise, press Return. In either case, the
                 release notes are copied to files in the SYS$HELP
                 directory.

                 After the installation, you can enter the following
                 command to review the release notes through the Help
                 facility, for example:

                 $ HELP GKS RELEASE_NOTES <Return>

              8. Purge the old DIGITAL GKS files.

    * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>

                                               Installing DIGITAL GKS 2-9

 







             The SYS$COMMON: directories may contain previous
             versions of DIGITAL GKS files. These files are replaced
             during the installation with new files, but the
             old files are not automatically purged. Purging is
             recommended. In response to the purging prompt, press
             Return to purge the files or enter NO to keep them.

             Appendix A lists the files on the system that are added
             or modified when you install the DIGITAL GKS development
             kit and the run-time-only kit.

          9. Respond to license registration queries.

             DIGITAL GKS supports the OpenVMS License Management
             Facility (LMF). The installation procedure displays
             license information about your product and then asks if
             you have registered and loaded your authorization key
             for DIGITAL GKS. The following is an example of this
             information:

             DIGITAL GKS DEVELOPMENT KIT

                Product:       GKS
                Producer:      DEC
                Version:       6.5
                Release Date:  30-APR-1997

* Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded? Y <Return>

             DIGITAL GKS RUN-TIME-ONLY KIT

                Product:       GKS-RT
                Producer:      DEC
                Version:       6.5
                Release Date:  30-APR-1997

* Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded? Y <Return>

             Your PAK must be registered and loaded for the
             installation to complete successfully. Therefore, if
             your PAK is not registered and loaded, you must answer
             NO to this question, stop the installation, register and
             load your PAK, and then restart the installation.

          10.Install the PEX device handler.

             * Do you wish to install the PEX device handler and its associated
               files [NO]? Y <Return>

    2-10 Installing DIGITAL GKS

 







                 Installing the PEX device handler is optional. When
                 deciding whether to install the device handler, you
                 should consider the following:

                 o  The PEX device handler requires special graphics
                    accelerators.

                 o  If this device handler is installed, the installation
                    procedure modifies the DIGITAL GKS startup file,
                    GKSTARTUP.COM, to include the DIGITAL GKS PEX
                    workstation types. The installation procedure also
                    defines the necessary logical names.

                 Press Return to install the PEX device handler, or enter
                 NO if you do not want to install the device handler. If
                 you enter NO in response to this prompt, you can install
                 the device handler at a later date by performing the
                 installation procedure again.

              11.Install PEXlib (development kit only).

                 * Do you wish to have PEXlib installed [YES]? <Return>

                 If you chose to install the PEX device handler, you can
                 also install the PEXlib library, by pressing Return. If
                 you do not want to install PEXlib, enter NO.

              12.Install the GKS example programs (development kit only).

                 * Do you wish to install the example programs [YES]? <Return>

                 The example programs are source code files written in
                 various programming languages that illustrate how to
                 call various DIGITAL GKS functions. Press Return if you
                 want to install these programs. Enter NO if you do not
                 want to install these programs.

              13.Install the Japanese GKS-related files.

                       This kit contains Japanese related-images and files.
                       They require Japanese OpenVMS.

      * Do you wish to install Japanese related images and files [NO]? <Return>

                 If the Japanese version of OpenVMS VAX is installed on
                 your system, you will be asked if you want to install
                 the Japanese components of DIGITAL GKS. Press Return if
                 you do not want to install the Japanese files. Enter YES
                 if you do want to install these files.

          14.Run the Installation Verification Procedure.

* Do you wish to perform the Installation Verification Procedure [YES]? <Return>

             The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) verifies
             that the installation is successful. The DIGITAL GKS
             IVP reads a three-dimensional image from a metafile
             workstation (GKS$TEST:GKS$IVP.DAT). The metafile is
             large, and executing the IVP tests the DIGITAL GKS
             installation thoroughly.

             Press Return if you wish to run the IVP during the
             installation; enter NO if you do not wish to run this
             procedure. If you do not run the IVP at this time,
             DIGITAL recommends that you run this procedure after the
             installation to verify that the software is available
             on your system. You may also need to run the IVP
             after a system failure to ensure that users can access
             DIGITAL GKS. Refer to Section 3.3 for details.

          15.Select the workstation type on which the IVP will be
             displayed.

 * Select the workstation type; 1 for Motif or 2 for DECwindows [1]: 1 <Return>

             If you are installing DIGITAL GKS on a workstation that
             has DECwindows or Motif software installed, you must
             define the workstation type on which the IVP image will
             be displayed. The default workstation types are listed
             in Table 2-1.

          Table_2-1_Default_Workstation_Types________________________

          Workstation__________________________Default_Type__________

             The IVP image is output to the default OUTPUT or OUTIN
             workstation, which is defined by the workstation
             identifier and connection identifier (the logical
             names GKS$WSTYPE and GKS$CONID, respectively). You
             can redirect the IVP output to another workstation by
             modifying the values associated to the logical names.

                 If the installation is successful, the IVP generates
                 a picture like the one in Figure 2-1. If your device
                 produces color output, the image will appear in color.

              Figure 2-1 Sample IVP Display

        See the PostScript(R) or Bookreader[TM] version to view the
        figure.

              16.Select the version of the Motif device handler to be
                 used.

                 * Select the Motif device handler (1 for Motif V1.1 or 2 for
                   Motif V1.2) [1]: 2 <Return>

                 If the version of Motif installed on your system is
                 1.2, you must choose the version of the Motif device
                 handler to be used. Press Return if you wish to use
                 Motif Version 1.1. Enter 2 if you wish to use Motif
                 Version 1.2.

              17.Read the informational messages.

                 At this point, the installation procedure displays a
                 number of informational messages that report on the
                 progress of the installation; there are no further
                 questions. If the installation procedure has been
                 successful up to this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new
                 or modified files to their target directories, updates
                 help files, and updates DCL tables, if necessary. If you
                 requested that files be purged, they are purged at this
                 time.

        2.2 Error Recovery

              If errors occur during installation, VMSINSTAL displays
              failure messages. If the installation procedure fails, one
              or more of the following messages may also appear:

       %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of DIGITAL GKS V6.5 has failed.

              This kit requires OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2

              System disk does not contain enough free blocks to install DECGKS

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exists:

              o  The operating system version is incorrect.

              o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  System parameter values for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

              o  The product license has not been registered and loaded.

              o  The metafile input handler is not installed.

              o  The default output handler, defined by the logical names
                 GKS$WSTYPE and GKS$CONID, is not installed.

              If the IVP fails for any reason, the following messages are
              displayed:

              The DECGKS V6.5 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for DECGKS V6.5 has failed.

              Other errors can also occur during IVP execution in the
              following

              o  The workstation handler is not installed.

                 GKS-E-ERROR_23, specified workstation type does not exist in

             First, verify that the metafile input handler is
             installed. Then, ensure that the definition of
             GKS$WSTYPE is a valid workstation type, including bit
             masks, and that GKS$CONID corresponds to a physical
             device that is supported and functioning.

          o  The connection identifier and workstation type are not
             compatible.

             GKS-E-ERROR_26, specified workstation cannot be opened
              in routine OPEN WORKSTATION

             Ensure that the definitions of GKS$CONID and GKS$WSTYPE
             are compatible, and that GKS$CONID corresponds to a
             physical device that is supported and functioning.

          o  There are not enough unused color entries available for
             DIGITAL GKS in DECwindows.

             DECGKS-E-ERROR_NEG_2, requested color map could not be created
              in routine OPEN WORKSTATION

             Set n (the color table size) in the workstation bit
             mask %x0nmm00xx to a value, such as 16. For example, for
             workstation type 231, specify %x001000E7.

          If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
          you should take the appropriate action, as described in
          the error message. For descriptions of the error messages,
          see the OpenVMS System Messages and Recovery Procedures
          Reference Manual, your processor-specific installation
          /operations guide, or the OpenVMS License Management
          Utility Manual.

                                                                        3
        _________________________________________________________________

                                             After Installing DIGITAL GKS


              You can perform the following tasks after you install
              DIGITAL GKS:

              o  Installing DIGITAL GKS on a cluster

              o  Editing the system startup file

              o  Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              o  Determining and reporting problems

        3.1 Installing DIGITAL GKS on an OpenVMS VAXcluster

              If you want to run DIGITAL GKS on multiple nodes of a
              VAXcluster configuration, first check to see that you have
              the appropriate software license. Then, follow these steps
              after installing DIGITAL GKS:

              1. Issue the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
                 on each node in the cluster on which DIGITAL GKS is to
                 be executed.

                 For the development kit, enter the command:

                 $ LICENSE LOAD GKS <Return>

                 For the run-time-only kit, enter the command:

                 $ LICENSE LOAD GKS-RT <Return>

              2. Run the following command on each node of the cluster
                 that has the software license:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:GKSTARTUP.COM <Return>

              3. Prepare the system-specific roots on other nodes by
                 issuing the following commands on each node:

                 $ CREATE/DIRECTORY SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.GKS] <Return>
                 $ CREATE/DIRECTORY SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSTEST.GKS] <Return>

                                         After Installing DIGITAL GKS 3-1

 







          4. Verify the installation by running the IVP on each node:

             $ RUN GKS$TEST:GKS$IVP <Return>

             Information about running the IVP is provided in
             Section 3.3.

          5. Determine if the INSTALL utility was used to install
             GKS3D$RTLIB.EXE:

             a. Log in to a node on the cluster.

             b. Run INSTALL and enter the following command at the
                INSTALL> prompt:

                INSTALL> LIST SYS$LIBRARY:GKS3D$RTLIB.EXE <Return>

                The INSTALL utility displays how the GKS3D$RTLIB was
                installed. For example:

                DISK$SYSTEM01:<SYS0.SYSCOMMON.SYSLIB>.EXE
                    GKS3D$RTLIB;1    Open     Share         Lnkbl

                If an error occurs with this command, DIGITAL GKS was
                not properly installed.

             c. Repeat steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

          Do not purge files during the installation. You can purge
          these files after you have run the DIGITAL GKS startup
          command procedure on each node of the cluster.

    3.2 Editing the System Startup File

          To enable the automatic startup of DIGITAL GKS
          when your system is rebooted, you must include the
          startup procedure GKSTARTUP.COM in the startup file-
          SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM under OpenVMS VAX Version
          5.5-2 or SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM under OpenVMS
          VAX Version 6.5. Because DIGITAL GKS cannot be started
          before the network has been started, you must position this
          new command line after the line that invokes the network
          startup command procedure. The following example shows the
          network startup command line followed by the DIGITAL GKS
          startup command line:

    3-2 After Installing DIGITAL GKS

 







              $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
                   .
                   .
                   .
              $ @SYS$STARTUP:GKSTARTUP.COM

              When you install DIGITAL GKS on a cluster, GKSTARTUP.COM
              is automatically executed for the system node from which
              the installation was performed. You may need to execute
              this file for other nodes in the cluster, however, to have
              the newest DIGITAL GKS images installed on those systems.
              This is particularly true if you purged older versions of
              DIGITAL GKS during the installation.

        3.3 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              To run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) after
              installation, enter the command:

              $ RUN GKS$TEST:GKS$IVP <Return>

              For example, if you want to run the DECwindows Motif IVP
              on a remote node, ensure that you have the access rights
              on the server for remote use and that the DIGITAL GKS
              DECwindows Motif handler is installed. Then, enter the
              following commands, substituting your node name for the
              node REMOTE:

              $ DEFINE GKS$WSTYPE 231 <Return>
              $ DEFINE GKS$CONID  REMOTE::0.0 <Return>
              $ RUN GKS$TEST:GKS$IVP <Return>

              In this example, the image is output to the remote server.

        3.4 Determining and Reporting Problems

              If you encounter a problem while using DIGITAL GKS, report
              it to DIGITAL. Depending on the nature of the problem
              and the type of support you have, you can take one of the
              following actions:

              o  Call DIGITAL if your software contract or warranty
                 agreement entitles you to telephone support.

              o  Submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

                                         After Installing DIGITAL GKS 3-3

 







          o  Send electronic mail to the
             "requests@bgsdev.enet.dec.com" account if the problem
             has to do with the DIGITAL GKS documentation. Be sure to
             include the section and page number of the error.

          Review the Software Product Description (SPD) and Warranty
          Addendum for an explanation of warranty. If you encounter a
          problem during the warranty period, report the problem as
          described in this section, or follow alternate instructions
          provided by DIGITAL for reporting SPD nonconformance
          problems.

    This kit contains a PEX device handler.  Installation of this device handler
    is optional.  The following points should be considered before electing to
    install the PEX device handler and its associated files.

     1. The PEX device handler requires specialized graphics hardware,
        for example, the VAXstation 3520, VAXStation 3540, or VAXstation 4000.
        If GKS application programs are to be run in a client/server
        environment you should elect to install the PEX device handler if any
        of the nodes have the accelerated (specialized) graphics hardware.

     2. If you choose to install the PEX device handler, the DECwindows server
        must be restarted before you can run any DIGITAL GKS program which uses
        the pex device handler.  To restart the DECwindows server, issue the
        command:

    B-2 Sample Installation

 







         @SYS$STARTUP:DECW$STARTUP.COM RESTART

      3. If you choose to install the PEX device handler, the DIGITAL GKS startup
         file, GKSTARTUP.COM, will be modified to include the DIGITAL GKS PEX
         workstation types and the necessary logical names will be defined.
         If these logical names are not defined a DIGITAL GKS application program
         will generate an error if an attempt is made to utilize the PEX
         workstation types.

      4. The PEX device handler and its associated files can be installed at a
         later date by performing this installation procedure again.

     This kit contains a PEX device handler.  Installation of this device handler
     is optional.  The following points should be considered before electing to
     install the PEX device handler and its associated files.

     1. The PEX device handler requires specialized graphics hardware,
        for example, the VAXstation 3520, VAXStation 3540, or VAXstation 4000.
        If GKS application programs are to be run in a client/server
        environment, you should elect to install the PEX device handler if any
        of the nodes have the accelerated (specialized) graphics hardware.

     2. If you choose to install the PEX device handler, the DECwindows server
        must be restarted before you can run any DIGITAL GKS program which uses
        the pex device handler.  To restart the DECwindows server, issue the
        command:

        @SYS$STARTUP:DECW$STARTUP.COM RESTART

     3. If you choose to install the PEX device handler, the DIGITAL GKS startup
        file, GKSTARTUP.COM, will be modified to include the DIGITAL GKS PEX
        workstation types and the necessary logical names will be defined.
        If these logical names are not defined a DIGITAL GKS application program
        will generate an error if an attempt is made to utilize the PEX
        workstation types.

     4. The PEX device handler and its associated files can be installed at a
        later date by performing this installation procedure again.

  * Do you wish to install the PEX device handler and its associated files [NO]? <Return>

     This kit contains Japanese-related images and files.

     This kit contains an Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) to
     verify the correct installation of the DIGITAL GKS product.  It can be run
     prior to the conclusion of this procedure by answering "YES" to the IVP
     prompt or invoked after the installation as follows:

          RUN SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSTEST.GKS]GKS$IVP
     or
          RUN GKS$TEST:GKS$IVP)
