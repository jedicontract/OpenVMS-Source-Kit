PRODUCT NAME:  DECdfs for OpenVMS                      SPD 28.78.07
               Version 2.3-1

DESCRIPTION

DECdfs for OpenVMS is a DECnet for OpenVMS and DECnet-Plus layered prod-
uct that provides OpenVMS users with the ability to use remote Open-
VMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha disks as if they were directly attached to
the local OpenVMS system.

DECdfs software provides users and applications with transparent, high
performance file access while using fewer CPU resources than standard
DECnet for OpenVMS and DECnet-Plus file access.

Systems running DECdfs software can act as "servers" or "clients" or
both. DECdfs servers make file resources available to systems running
DECdfs client software. DECdfs clients are able to use file resources
of systems running DECdfs server software. The file resources acces-
sible through DECdfs can range in scope from a master file directory
and all of its subordinate directories and files on a disk volume, to
an individual file. The DECdfs server software assigns a unique name
to the resource to be shared.

In configurations where DECdns (Distributed Name Service) is supported,
the DECdfs server registers the resource name with DECdns. In config-
urations where DECdns is not supported, the DECdfs client must include
the resource location name when issuing the command to use the resource.

DECdfs software uses DECdns on OpenVMS VAX configurations running DEC-
net for OpenVMS or DECnet-Plus, and on OpenVMS Alpha configurations
running DECnet-Plus. In order for DECdfs to use DECdns, there must be
at least one DECdns server in the network. DECdns allows the name of

the resource to be independent of its physical location on the net-
work. DECdfs systems throughout the network can continue accessing a
resource even if the resource location is changed.

DECdns is not available on OpenVMS Alpha configurations running DEC-
net, but these configurations can use DECdfs by specifying the node
name where the resource is located.

The DECdfs client uses the resource by means of the DFS$CONTROL MOUNT
command. This command specifies the DECdns name by which the resource
was registered, enables communication between the client and the server,
and creates a pseudo-device on the client system. The pseudo-device
makes the remote resource appear to the client system as a local disk.
Users can then perform operations on the pseudo-device, and DECdfs han-
dles all of the network access and translation.

Features

The features of DECdfs for OpenVMS Version 2.3-1 include:

o  High performance access to remote disks

o  Applications require no modifications to use remote disks, because
   the disks appear to be local

o  Fewer CPU resources used than standard DECnet for OpenVMS and DECnet-
   Plus file access

o  Supports all OpenVMS file types, including Extended File Specifi-
   cations

o  Supports the following OpenVMS file operations:

   -  Shared access (read)

   -  Exclusive access (read & write)

   -  All OpenVMS directory operations, including the creation and dele-
      tion of directories

   -  Virtual I/O

   -  Mapped I/O

                                 2

 

o  Transparent access to most of the standard OpenVMS DCL commands (those
   commands which neither manipulate identifiers nor use logical, phys-
   ical or write-shared I/O)

o  Operates in any DECnet for OpenVMS, DECnet-Plus, or DECnet over IP
   environment; both Local Area Networks and Wide Area Networks are
   supported

o  Uses DECdns, if present, to provide location-independent data ac-
   cess

o  File security provided through standard OpenVMS proxy mechanisms.
   The system manager on the server controls all file access

o  Optional end-to-end checksum provided to guard against network faults

o  The DECdfs Management utility allows the user to control DECdfs com-
   ponents and to display statistical and error information

o  Supports 64-bit addresses for I/O buffers on OpenVMS Alpha Version
   7.0 and later

Restrictions

o  Files opened for write are opened exclusively

o  Logical I/O is not supported

o  Installed files are not supported

o  The use of ACLs (Access Control Lists) on DECdfs client devices is
   not supported. ACLs on served files are not visible to a DECdfs client.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

SOFTWARE LICENSING

A license is required for each OpenVMS system on which the DECdfs for
OpenVMS software is to be installed and executed. A DECdfs license is
required on:

o  Each server node that registers available directories or files for
   access and use by DECdfs clients

o  Each client node that accesses and uses the directories or files
   on a DECdfs server

Each OpenVMS system may be licensed to use the full functionality of
DECdfs or the client functionality only. A full functionality license
grants the right to use both the client capabilities and the server
capabilities.
