              This chapter describes the prerequisites for installing the
              DECdfs software on an OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha system.
              It covers the following topics:

              o  Contents of the kit

              o  Hardware and software requirements

              o  License registration

              o  Disk space requirements

              o  Installing over earlier DECdfs versions

              o  System Generation (SYSGEN) parameters

              o  Account and quota requirements

              o  Installation time

              o  Configuration planning

              o  Reviewing the installation procedure

              o  Maintenance updates

        1.1 Contents of the Kit

              DECdfs software is available on compact disc read-only
              memory (CD-ROM). Contact your Compaq support representative
              if any components of the software distribution kit are
              missing.

                                           Installation Prerequisites 1-1

 



    Installation Prerequisites
    1.1 Contents of the Kit


          The DECdfs release notes are available on line. Read
          steps 2 and 6 in Section 2.2 for instructions on how
          to access them. After you install DECdfs, the release
          notes file (DECDFS01023.RELEASE_NOTES) resides in the
          SYS$HELP directory. Compaq recommends that you read the
          release notes and the installation guide before you install
          DECdfs.

    1.2 Required Hardware

          The only required hardware is the DECnet Phase IV or
          DECnet Phase V network hardware. For a list of supported
          hardware and configurations, refer to the Software Product
          Description (SPD) for DECdfs for OpenVMS Version 2.3-1 and
          to the SPD for the version of the OpenVMS operating system
          on which you plan to run DECdfs.

    1.3 Required Software

          You must be running DECnet for OpenVMS, DECnet/OSI, or
          DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS on your OpenVMS operating system
          before you install DECdfs.

          In the DECdfs documentation, DECnet Phase IV is used to
          refer to DECnet for OpenVMS, and DECnet Phase V is used
          to refer to either or both DECnet/OSI and DECnet-Plus for
          OpenVMS.

          The software required to run DECdfs Version 2.3-1 is as
          follows:

          o  OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2 (with DECnet Phase IV only)

          o  OpenVMS VAX Version 6.2, 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 with DECnet
             Phase IV or DECnet Phase V

          o  OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2, 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 with DECnet
             Phase IV or DECnet Phase V

    1.4 License Registration (PAK)

          You must register and load the DECdfs license Product
          Authorization Key (PAK) before you can run the DECdfs
          software and the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP).

    1-2 Installation Prerequisites

 



                                               Installation Prerequisites
                                           1.4 License Registration (PAK)


              Use the License Management utility (LICENSE) to register
              and load the DECdfs license PAK in the LMF database before
              or after installing the DECdfs software. Use the License
              Management utility (LICENSE) documentation to learn how to
              register and load a license PAK.

              When you register the license PAK before you install, the
              IVP runs automatically (if selected) and DECdfs starts
              automatically at the end of the installation. Neither
              happens if you do not register the license PAK until after
              the installation.

              See the OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual for more
              information about registering and loading licenses for
              OpenVMS layered products.

        1.5 Required Disk Space

              To install DECdfs, there must be a minimum amount of
              free disk space (peak block count) on the system disk
              (SYS$SYSDEVICE:). After DECdfs is installed, the DECdfs
              files require less disk space (net block count). Required
              space depends on the processor, as shown in the following
              table:

              ___________________________________________________________
              Processor_____Peak_Blocks___Net_Blocks_____________________

              VAX           1500          1250

              Alpha_________3525__________3250___________________________

              To display the number of free blocks, enter the following
              DCL command:

              $ SHOW DEVICES SYS$SYSDEVICE

              The number of free blocks is displayed on your screen under
              the Free Blocks heading, as follows:

              Device   Device   Error   Volume  Free   Trans  Mnt
              Name     Status   Count   Label   Blocks Count  Cnt
              DUA0:    Mounted     0    DAISY   31625    82   1

              If the system disk does not contain enough free space,
              you must purge files, remove unused files (log files, for
              example), or remove some applications or user files. You
              can then install the DECdfs software.

    Installation Prerequisites
    1.6 Installing Over Earlier Versions of DECdfs Software


    1.6 Installing Over Earlier Versions of DECdfs Software

          As of DECdfs Version 1.3, several tuning parameters were
          removed to ease performance management tasks. Consequently,
          the following command qualifiers and logical names are
          obsolete:

          o  /SESSIONS_MAXIMUM and /CONNECTIONS_MAXIMUM qualifiers

             In the Communication Entity, both the /SESSIONS_MAXIMUM
             and /CONNECTIONS_MAXIMUM qualifiers have been removed
             from the SET COMMUNICATION and SHOW COMMUNICATION
             commands. DECdfs now automatically allocates session and
             communication blocks to accommodate increased requests.

          o  /FILES_MAXIMUM qualifier

             In the server, the /FILES_MAXIMUM qualifier for the SET
             SERVER and SHOW SERVER commands has been removed. DECdfs
             now automatically allocates blocks that correspond to
             open files.

          o  /PERSONA_CACHE=BLOCKS_THRESHOLD qualifier and value

             As part of persona cache autosizing in the server entity
             of DECdfs, the BLOCKS_THRESHOLD value for the /PERSONA_
             CACHE qualifier of the SET SERVER and SHOW SERVER
             commands has been disabled. DECdfs now automatically
             recalculates this threshold periodically.

          o  DFS$PQL_FILLM and DFS$PQL_BYTLM logical names

             The two logical names DFS$PQL_FILLM and DFS$PQL_BYTLM,
             which were defined in file DFS$CONFIG.COM in versions of
             DECdfs prior to Version 1.3, are no longer necessary and
             will be ignored if they exist in the file. DECdfs now
             automatically computes values for these server process
             quotas based on the SYSGEN parameter CHANNELCNT.

          If you are installing DECdfs over a version of DECdfs
          earlier than Version 1.3 and the existing DFS$CONFIG.COM
          contains any of the qualifiers or logical names shown in
          the above list, you should either rename DFS$CONFIG.COM
          to disable it or edit the file and remove the obsolete
          qualifiers or logical names. DECdfs issues a warning
          message if it finds obsolete qualifiers or logical names
          during startup.

        1.7 SYSGEN Parameters

              The following sections describe how to check and modify
              the System Generation (SYSGEN) parameters that are needed
              to run DECdfs. After modifying any SYSGEN parameters in
              the MODPARAMS.DAT file, invoke the OpenVMS AUTOGEN command
              procedure to automatically adjust the values of the other
              system parameters and reboot the system to set the new
              parameter values. For information about AUTOGEN, see the
              OpenVMS System Manager's Manual.

              To run DECdfs, you might need to modify the following
              SYSGEN parameters:

              o  NPAGEDYN (nonpaged dynamic pool size)

              o  INTSTKPAGES (system interrupt stack size)

              o  GBLPAGES (global pages) and GLBSECTIONS (global
                 sections)

        1.7.1 Increasing the Nonpaged Pool Size

              To use DECdfs, you may need to increase the size of the
              nonpaged dynamic pool (the SYSGEN parameter NPAGEDYN).

              For a client-only node, add 100,000 bytes of nonpaged pool.
              For a server node, Compaq recommends an additional 250,000
              bytes of nonpaged pool. The additional bytes are usually
              sufficient for the normal use of approximately 10 to 20
              DECdfs client devices.

              To increase the nonpaged pool size, edit the MODPARAMS.DAT
              file in the SYS$SYSTEM directory. Add the statements that
              increase the value of the SYSGEN parameter NPAGEDYN as
              follows:

              o  For a client-only node, add the following comment and
                 statement at the end of the file:

                 ! Add some nonpaged pool for DECdfs client
                 !
                 ADD_NPAGEDYN=100000

    Installation Prerequisites
    1.7 SYSGEN Parameters


          o  For a server node, add the following comment and
             statement at the end of the file:

             ! Add some nonpaged pool for DECdfs server
             !
             ADD_NPAGEDYN=250000

          If you decide to increase the data cache size on the server
          node, increase the server node's nonpaged pool size further
          (see the DECdfs for OpenVMS Management Guide).

    1.7.2 Increasing the System Interrupt Stack Size (VAX Systems
          Only)

          To use DECdfs, increase the size of the system interrupt
          stack four pages more than your current use. To
          increase the size of the interrupt stack, edit the
          SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file to add a statement that
          increments the value of the SYSGEN parameter INTSTKPAGES.

          For a server node, add the following statement at the end
          of the MODPARAMS.DAT file:

          ! Increase the size of the interrupt stack for the DECdfs
          ! server.
          ADD_INTSTKPAGES=4

          By increasing the size of the system interrupt stack, you
          can prevent the DECdfs server from experiencing occasional
          system halts. An interrupt stack pointer error (ISP ERR) or
          similar hardware error message is displayed when the size
          of the interrupt stack is too small. The specific error
          message that is displayed depends on the VAX model you are
          using.

    1.7.3 Increasing Global Pages and Global Sections

          To use DECdfs, you may need to increase the number of
          global pages and global sections (the SYSGEN parameters
          GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS). If the current settings for
          these parameters are inadequate, VMSINSTAL cannot start
          DECdfs after installation.

          The following table shows how many additional global pages
          and global sections you need for a DECdfs server node
          running on a VAX or Alpha processor:

              Alpha_________1312______________10_________________________

              For a client-only node, DECdfs requires about 60 percent
              of the global page values shown in the previous table; the
              global section requirements are the same.

              To check the number of available global pages and global
              sections, use the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical
              function to find the number of free global pages and global
              sections. The following example shows how to get this
              information at your terminal or workstation (the default
              destination for SYS$OUTPUT):

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")
                15848
              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")
                24

              If the number of unused global pages and global
              sections is insufficient to run DECdfs, edit the
              SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file and insert statements that
              raise the values of the SYSGEN parameters GBLPAGES and
              GBLSECTIONS.

              To increase the values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS, add
              the following statements at the end of the MODPARAMS.DAT
              file. The variables nnn and mmm represent numbers that you
              add to the current setting for these SYSGEN parameters.

              ADD_GBLPAGES=nnn
              ADD_GBLSECTIONS=mmm

        1.7.4 Increasing the Channel Count

              Your system's channel count parameter, CHANNELCNT,
              specifies the maximum number of files that any process
              on the system can open concurrently. Each file requires
              one channel, and the DECdfs server process opens all local
              files that users at DECdfs clients access. If the server
              is your system's most active file user, you may need to
              increase the channel count to accommodate the server.

    1.7 SYSGEN Parameters


          Determine the appropriate CHANNELCNT parameter by
          estimating the maximum number of simultaneously open files
          you expect on the server. Add 15 to this number to allow
          for some additional channels for the server's own use. For
          example, if you expect 250 files to be open simultaneously,
          set the CHANNELCNT parameter to 265 channels before running
          DECdfs.

          Insert the following line in the MODPARAMS.DAT file in the
          SYS$SYSTEM directory, and then run the AUTOGEN procedure:

          ADD_CHANNELCNT = 265

          For information on AUTOGEN, see the OpenVMS System
          Management Utilities Reference Manual. You can read the
          online help information about the CHANNELCNT parameter by
          entering the following SYSGEN HELP command:

          $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
          SYSGEN> HELP PARAMETERS SPECIAL_PARAMS CHANNELCNT

    1.8 Account and Quota Requirements

          To run VMSINSTAL, you must have the following privileges:
          SYSPRV, SYSNAM, OPER, NETMBX, TMPMBX, CMKRNL, DETACH,
          ALTPRI, ACNT, PRMMBX, PSWAPM, and PHY_IO. Use the system
          manager account to install the DECdfs software.

          The default values for the system quotas are sufficient to
          install DECdfs. See the OpenVMS System Services Reference
          Manual for more information about system quotas.

    1.9 Installation Time

          The DECdfs software installation takes less than 5 minutes
          when installed from CD-ROM. The time that it takes to
          install DECdfs client or server software is similar, but
          can vary depending on the processor, distribution media,
          and system load. The installation verification procedure
          (IVP) takes approximately 30 seconds.

        1.10 Configuration Planning

              Before you install any DECdfs software, you need to plan
              your configuration. Decide which nodes will be DECdfs
              server nodes (those with active DECdfs server and client
              software) and which will be DECdfs client-only nodes (those
              with active DECdfs client software only). You must consider
              how many servers and client-only nodes exist in your
              network, as well as their locations. This information is
              important in deciding where to place servers.

              A DECdfs server allows users at DECdfs clients to access
              server disks and directories. These disks and directories
              appear to be local to the DECdfs client system. For
              information on DECdfs server and client functions, see
              the DECdfs for OpenVMS Management Guide.

              When you install DECdfs software without specifying that
              you want a client-only node, the software for clients and
              servers is loaded and the node becomes a DECdfs server.
              When you specify client-only, then only the DECdfs client
              software starts up on the client-only node. The server
              software is present but inactive on client-only nodes.

              See Section 1.10.3 or Section 3.7 for information on
              changing the configuration of client systems and server
              systems.

        1.10.1 Configuration Questions

              As you plan your configuration, consider the following
              criteria:

              o  The nodes on which you will install DECdfs client-only
                 software.

              o  The nodes on which you will install DECdfs server
                 software.

              o  The namespace naming conventions used on your network.
                 See Section 1.10.2 for information on DECdns.

              o  Whether the DECdfs and DECnet license PAKs are
                 registered and loaded on systems that will be clients
                 and servers.

              o  Whether each node in a cluster environment has DECdfs
                 and DECnet license PAKs.

    1.10.2 The DECdns Distributed Name Service (DECdns)

          On all DECnet Phase V systems, and on VAX systems running
          DECnet Phase IV, DECdfs uses the facilities of the DECdns
          Distributed Name Service to identify file services. This
          allows clients to access file services without explicitly
          knowing the name or location of the node that provides the
          service. On Alpha systems running DECnet Phase IV, DECdns
          is not available, and consequently, DECdfs operational
          procedures are adjusted to include specifying the node name
          of the server in appropriate places.

          The following stated requirements here and elsewhere in
          this guide regarding DECdns do not apply to DECnet Phase
          IV Alpha systems. However, you should refer to the DECdfs
          for OpenVMS Management Guide for information concerning the
          interaction between nodes that do and do not use DECdns.

          DECdns provides a database (called a namespace) for
          storing and managing the names and addresses of resources
          that are distributed throughout a network. This scheme
          permits users and applications throughout the network
          to locate a particular resource by its name rather than
          its address. Thus, network resources can move to a new
          location without affecting users or applications seeking
          them. If someone moves a resource, that person writes the
          new address information into the namespace. The next user
          or application seeking that resource by name automatically
          gets the updated address information from the namespace.

    1.10.2.1 Access Points

          DECdfs servers store address information for access points
          in the DECdns namespace. An access point represents the
          file resources that a DECdfs server makes available to a
          DECdfs client. Each access point name resides in the DECdns
          namespace and provides the address information for a DECdfs
          server that offers that particular file resource.

          Ask your network's DECdns manager to help you perform the
          following tasks:

          o  Identify a node that has the DECdns server software. A
             DECdns server must be installed, running, and accessible
             before you can use the DECdfs software or run the IVP.

              o  Create access point names that comply with the DECdns
                 naming conventions used on your network.

              The DECdns manager must also provide access rights to
              DECdfs server accounts and client accounts, as follows:

              o  The account from which you operate a DECdfs server needs
                 read and write access rights in any DECdns directory in
                 which you plan to store access points.

              o  The account from which you plan to run a DECdfs client
                 installation and verification procedure (IVP) needs read
                 access rights in the DECdns directory containing any
                 DECdfs access point.

        1.10.2.2 DECdns Clerk

              DECdfs Version 2.3-1 should be installed on nodes running
              OpenVMS Version 5.5-2 or a higher version. These versions
              of OpenVMS include the DECdns clerk, so the DECdfs
              installation no longer supplies the DECdns clerk. The
              installation, however, still attempts to start the
              DECdns clerk if it has not already been started and if
              file DNS$DEFAULT_FILE.DAT exists. If this file does not
              exist, the installation reminds you to execute procedure
              SYS$STARTUP:DNS$CHANGE_DEF_FILE.COM before you try to start
              DECdfs. This procedure copies file DNS$DEFAULT_FILE.DAT to
              your node and starts the DECdns clerk.

              On systems running DECnet Phase V, the file DNS$DEFAULT_
              FILE.DAT is no longer used. The DECdns clerk is always
              installed and running on DECnet Phase V systems.

        1.10.2.3 DECdns Logical Name Table

              DECdns uses its own logical name table for DECdns objects.
              You must supply the name of this table, DNS$SYSTEM_TABLE,
              to any DEFINE command that applies to related DECdns
              objects. For example, suppose you want to define a system
              logical name in your DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM procedure for your
              namespace name or directory. Supply the DEFINE statement
              with the qualifier that specifies the DECdns logical
              name table, DNS$SYSTEM_TABLE. To create the logical name
              EXAMPLE_DIR, you could include the following line:

              $ DEFINE/TABLE=DNS$SYSTEM_TABLE EXAMPLE_DIR -"THIS.IS.AN.EXAMPLE"

          Keep this OpenVMS and DECdns change in mind if you are
          upgrading to DECdfs Version 2.3-1 from an earlier version
          of DECdfs.

    1.10.3 Installing DECdfs on OpenVMS Cluster Systems

          In an OpenVMS Cluster environment with only one system
          disk, you need to install DECdfs server software on only
          one cluster member. VMSINSTAL places all DECdfs files in
          the SYS$COMMON directory. This provides identical DECdfs
          environments for each cluster member; for example, mounting
          the same access points and serving the same access points
          added by using the ADD ACCESS_POINT command with the
          /CLUSTER qualifier.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             All nodes in an OpenVMS Cluster system that will run
             DECdfs need a registered and loaded DECdfs license PAK
             before DECdfs can be started.

             ______________________________________________________

          You can create a different DECdfs environment on each
          node in an OpenVMS Cluster system by copying the
          DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM and DFS$CONFIG.COM files to each node's
          SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYS$STARTUP] directory and modifying it for
          that specific cluster member.

          If you want to run some cluster members as DECdfs client-
          only nodes and others as DECdfs server nodes, copy:

          o  The DFS$CONFIG.COM file to each member's
             SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYS$STARTUP] directory and modify it for
             that specific cluster member.

          o  The DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM file to each member's
             SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSMGR] directory and modify it for that
             specific cluster member.

          o  The DFS$STARTUP.COM file to each member's
             SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYS$STARTUP] directory and edit the
             following lines:

                 $!
                 $! Title = DFS$STARTUP.COM

              The flag START_SERVER_FLAG = "TRUE" indicates that the
              DECdfs server software can be started on this node.
              Edit the DFS$STARTUP.COM file only when you change the
              configuration of the node. Make one of the following
              changes:

              o  When you change from a server to a client-only node, you
                 must change the flag START_SERVER_FLAG from "TRUE" to
                 "FALSE."

              o  When you change from a client-only to a server node, you
                 must change the flag START_SERVER_FLAG from "FALSE" to
                 "TRUE."

              To run DECdfs on a heterogeneous OpenVMS Cluster system,
              on a mixed architecture OpenVMS Cluster system, or on
              a homogeneous OpenVMS Cluster system that uses multiple
              system disks, install DECdfs on each of the system disks.
              Each node and system disk needs a registered and loaded
              license PAK before DECdfs can be started on that node.

        1.11 Reviewing the DECdfs Installation Procedure

              Before installing DECdfs, assemble the information that
              you must provide to VMSINSTAL during the installation
              procedure. To determine the context in which VMSINSTAL
              requires this information, review the installation
              procedure (as described in Section 2.2).

              Read the DECdfs release notes before continuing the
              installation procedure. Use the OPTIONS N parameter in
              the command line to gain access to the release notes. After
              you complete the installation, you can access the release
              notes in SYS$HELP:DECDFS01023.RELEASE_NOTES. See Chapter 2
              for more information about the installation procedure.

              If DECdfs files exist on your system from a previous
              installation, read the following three sections.

    1.11 Reviewing the DECdfs Installation Procedure


    1.11.1 Rebooting an Existing DECdfs System Before or After the
           Installation

          DECdfs uses OpenVMS drivers that, once loaded, cannot be
          unloaded without rebooting the system. Therefore, if a
          previous version of DECdfs is running on the target system,
          one of the following two actions must be taken:

          o  Reboot the system without starting DECdfs before doing
             the installation.

          o  Do the installation and promptly reboot the system. In
             this case, once you complete the installation and before
             the system is rebooted, you will not be able to run
             DFS$CONTROL because of version incompatibilities between
             drivers, installed images, and new files. Furthermore,
             you cannot run the IVP until after the reboot.

          Compaq recommends that you reboot the system without
          starting DECdfs before you perform this installation. If
          you choose to do the installation first, reboot the system
          as soon as possible after the installation is complete.
          Do not attempt to run DFS$CONTROL or the IVP, or restart
          DECdfs, until after the reboot.

          If you reboot first, you will not need to reboot again when
          the installation completes. To avoid starting DECdfs, you
          must edit your SYS$SYSTARTUP file or otherwise temporarily
          eliminate the call to DFS$STARTUP.COM.

    1.11.2 Renaming Existing DFS*.EXE Files

          The installation checks whether any DFS*.EXE files are
          in the SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSEXE], SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSLIB],
          SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYS$LDR], or SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSMSG]
          directories. If you moved DFS*.EXE files to any of these
          directories, VMSINSTAL asks you if you want to rename all
          DFS*.EXE files to DFS*.OLD (see Section 2.3.1). If you
          answer YES, the installation procedure renames the files
          and continues. Otherwise, the installation procedure aborts
          and displays an error message.

          If you want to conserve disk space, remember to delete
          all the previous versions of the DFS*.EXE files from
          the SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSEXE], SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSLIB],
          SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYS$LDR], and SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSMSG]

                         1.11 Reviewing the DECdfs Installation Procedure


              directories before you install DECdfs. If DECdfs runs on a
              cluster system, delete these files on all cluster members.

        1.11.3 Processing Existing DFS*.COM Files

              As part of its installation, DECdfs Version 2.3-1 looks
              for existing DFS$CONFIG.COM and DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM files
              in directories SYS$STARTUP and SYS$MANAGER. If it does
              not find these files, the installation procedure places
              a default version of the missing file in SYS$MANAGER.
              If it finds these files, the installation procedure
              places the respective template files (DFS$CONFIG.TEMPLATE
              and DFS$SYSTARTUP.TEMPLATE) in SYS$MANAGER. Note that
              if you have previously moved either DFS$CONFIG.COM or
              DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM to SYS$SPECIFIC directories, the
              installation proceeds as if these two files do not exist.
              DECdfs uses the DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM and DFS$CONFIG.COM files
              for adding or mounting access points (or both) and for
              configuration purposes.

              The installation procedure always renames previously
              existing
              DFS$STARTUP.COM files to DFS$STARTUP.OLD and provides a new
              startup file in directory SYS$STARTUP.

        1.12 Maintenance Updates

              Compaq may periodically issue a maintenance update release
              of the DECdfs software. If you are upgrading from a
              previous version of DECdfs, your software installation
              kit will not include new documentation if the documentation
              has not been revised. In this case, use the installation
              guide for the previous version to install the new software.

              The release notes included with each software release
              describe new and changed software features. Compaq
              recommends that you read the release notes before
              installing the software to ensure that you are aware of
              any special installation or operating requirements.

              For more information about reading, printing, and accessing
              the release notes before you install the software,
              follow steps 1 through 6 of the installation procedure
              in Section 2.2. You can stop the installation procedure
              during step 6 by answering the "Do you want to continue
              the installation [NO]?" prompt with NO. You can read,

                                            Installation and Verification


              This chapter contains general information about the OpenVMS
              installation procedure (VMSINSTAL) and explains each step
              of the procedure. This chapter also describes additional
              DECdfs installation messages that you may receive during an
              installation.

        2.1 Preliminary Information

              Compaq recommends that you read Section 1.11 and this
              section before you install DECdfs. Compaq also recommends
              that you back up your system before beginning the
              installation.

              Use the installation procedure, VMSINSTAL, to install the
              DECdfs software on an OpenVMS system. The sample procedure
              in Section 2.2 installs both client and server software on
              a node. If you are establishing a client-only node, you can
              delete the files that are used by only the server after the
              DECdfs installation is complete. See Section 3.8 for more
              information about reclaiming disk space.

              VMSINSTAL asks a series of questions, to which you must
              provide appropriate responses. Default responses appear
              in brackets ([]). Press Return to accept the default
              response. For help while installing DECdfs, enter a
              question mark (?) after the prompt.

              To abort the installation procedure, press Ctrl/Y. The
              installation procedure deletes all DECdfs files that it has
              created up to that point and returns to the DCL prompt ($).
              If you want to retry the installation procedure after you
              press Ctrl/Y, you must invoke VMSINSTAL again. See Step 2
              in Section 2.2 for additional information.

    Installation and Verification
    2.1 Preliminary Information


          To save a copy of the VMSINSTAL session on disk for future
          reference, use the SET HOST 0 /LOG command before invoking
          VMSINSTAL. Node 0 represents the local node. See Appendix B
          for sample installations.

          Before you install DECdfs, ensure that:

          o  Your system is running the required software (see
             Section 1.3 for additional information).

          o  Your system has the required free disk space on
             the system disk (see Section 1.5 for additional
             information).

          o  You modified the SYSGEN parameters as described in
             Section 1.7.

          o  Your DECnet Phase IV or DECnet Phase V software is
             installed and running.

          o  At least one DECdfs server is installed, running, and
             accessible and at least one registered access point is
             available if you wish to create a DECdfs client-only
             configuration and run the Installation Verification
             Procedure (IVP).

          o  If you are running DECnet Phase IV on a VAX processor,
             the DECdns Distributed Name Service is running on
             the network and is accessible (see Section 1.10.2 for
             additional information).

          o  If you are running DECnet Phase IV on a VAX processor,
             the file SYS$SYSTEM:DNS$DEFAULT_FILE.DAT is necessary
             for DECdns to work properly. If this file does not exist
             on your system, execute SYS$STARTUP:DNS$CHANGE_DEF_
             FILE.COM to obtain a copy of this file from your DECdns
             server. The file is not necessary if you are running
             DECnet Phase V. DECdns is not available on Alpha systems
             running DECnet Phase IV.

    2.2 Installation Procedure

          This section presents the steps of a sample installation
          procedure for installing DECdfs client and server software.
          To install the DECdfs software, follow these steps:

                                               2.2 Installation Procedure


              Step 1. Log in to the system manager account.

              The system manager account has the necessary privileges to
              run VMSINSTAL.

              Step 2. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

              To invoke VMSINSTAL, enter the following command line:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DECDFS01023 ddcu: OPTIONS N

              The value ddcu: represents the name of the device where
              you mounted the distribution media. For example, if the
              DECdfs kit is in a subdirectory on a user disk, you might
              construct the device name MY_SYS$DUA1:[MY_DIRECTORY]. When
              you invoke VMSINSTAL and include the OPTIONS N parameter in
              the command line, you can view or print the release notes
              automatically. If you omit OPTIONS N in the command line,
              you cannot print or read the release notes until after the
              installation procedure is complete.

              The following message is displayed on the screen:

                      VAX/VMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.n

              It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.

              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The real version number, date, and time will be
                substituted for the variables shown in italic type.

                ______________________________________________________

              Step 3. Check the system environment.

              VMSINSTAL checks your system environment and notifies you
              of any running processes. For example, your system might
              display the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
                      MAIL_38503

              * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

              This message is informational only. Enter NO (or press
              Return) to end the installation and return to the DCL
              prompt ($). Enter YES to continue installing DECdfs.

    Installation and Verification
    2.2 Installation Procedure


          Step 4. Check backup.

          The following message reminds you to back up your system
          disk before installing software:

          * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

          Enter YES to continue installing DECdfs. Enter NO to end
          the installation and return to the DCL prompt ($).

          Step 5. Mount the installation kit volume.

          If the device you provided in step 2 for the distribution
          media is not mounted, VMSINSTAL prompts you to mount the
          installation kit volume. Mount the volume and ensure that
          the device is in the READY state. Enter YES and press
          Return when you are ready. A message confirms that the
          media is mounted and ready:

          Please mount the first volume of the set on ddcu:

          * Are you ready? YES
          %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, DECDFS01023 mounted on _ddcu:.

          Step 6. Start the installation.

          After you mount the installation kit volume, VMSINSTAL
          displays the following messages:

          The following products will be processed:

            DECDFS01 V2.3

                  Beginning installation of DECDFS01 V2.3 at hh:mm

          %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set A ...

          Release notes included with this kit are always copied to
          SYS$HELP. If you included OPTIONS N in the command line
          in step 2, the Additional Release Notes Options menu is
          displayed. You can select one of the following options:

          Additional Release Notes Options:

                  1.  Display release notes
                  2.  Print release notes
                  3.  Both 1 and 2
                  4.  None of the above

          * Select option [2]: 2

          If you choose option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
          notes at your terminal.

                                               2.2 Installation Procedure


              If you choose option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you to enter a
              print queue name as follows:

              Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

              Type a print queue name or press Return. VMSINSTAL queues a
              copy of the release notes to print and displays a message
              such as the following:

              Job DECDFS01023 (queue queue, entry nnn) started on queue

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on your screen and prompts you for a print queue
              name.

              If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL does not display or
              print the release notes at any time during the installation
              procedure.

              After you select any of the options, VMSINSTAL displays the
              following message:

              * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]?

              One way to read the release notes now is to respond NO
              and locate them in SYS$HELP. A NO response terminates the
              installation and requires you to start again at step 1.
              Regardless of your response, the procedure displays the
              following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been
              successfully moved to SYS$HELP.

              Step 7. Run the Installation Verification Procedure.

              VMSINSTAL asks whether you want to run the Installation
              Verification Procedure (IVP) as part of the installation
              procedure. If you enter YES, you need to supply an access
              point name in step 13. If you enter NO, VMSINSTAL skips
              steps 13 and 14.

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

              Step 8. Purge old files.

              VMSINSTAL asks whether you want to purge files that are
              replaced during the installation process. To retain the old
              copies, enter NO; otherwise, enter YES (or press Return).

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

    Installation and Verification
    2.2 Installation Procedure


          If VMSINSTAL finds DFS*.EXE files in any SYS$SPECIFIC:
          directory, the procedure lists the files and asks whether
          you want to rename them. See Section 2.3.1 for the dialog
          and possible responses.

          If VMSINSTAL finds DECdfs driver files in SYS$SYSTEM,
          the procedure asks whether you want to delete them. See
          Section 2.3.2 for the dialog and possible responses.

          Step 9. Verify the configuration.

          VMSINSTAL asks whether the stated configuration is correct
          or not.

          DECnet Phase IV:

           Current configuration:   OpenVMS/xxx Vn.n - DECnet

          * Install the DFS files that support this configuration? [YES]?

          DECnet Phase V:

           Current configuration:   OpenVMS/xxx Vn.n - DECnet-
          Plus

          * Install the DFS files that support this configuration? [YES]?

          In the previous examples, the variables can have the
          following values:

          o  xxx can be either a VAX or an Alpha processor

          o  Vn.n can be Version 5.5-2, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 for VAX
             processors, and Version 6.2, 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 for Alpha
             processors

          To use the configuration displayed, enter YES (or press
          Return). If this configuration does not represent the
          system, enter NO. If you enter NO, you are given the
          opportunity to choose one of the following alternate
          configurations:

           Possible configurations:
                      1. OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2 - DECnet Phase IV

                      2. OpenVMS VAX V6.2   - DECnet Phase IV

              * Enter number [8]

              If you want to stop the installation, enter 0. The default
              is the stated configuration. If you prefer the alternate
              configuration, enter one of the other numbers. If you
              choose an alternate configuration, a difference will
              exist between the stated configuration and the chosen
              configuration, and a warning message and question therefore
              will be displayed.

              * Do you wish to continue with this configuration? [NO]

              If you answer NO, the installation ends. If you answer YES,
              it continues.

              Step 10. Install the Help Message Utility.

              If you are installing on a system that is running OpenVMS
              Version 6.2 or later, the following question is displayed:

              * Install DFS Help Message file? [YES]

              If you answer YES, the installation procedure displays the
              following message:

    Installation and Verification
    2.2 Installation Procedure


            Add SYS$HELP:DFS.MSGHLP$DATA to the searchlist defined by
            MSGHLP$LIBRARY in order to include the DFS messages in your
            HELP/MESSAGE search. Please refer to the OpenVMS SYSTEM
            MANAGER'S MANUAL: ESSENTIALS for more information.

          Step 11. Install client or server software.

          Indicate whether you want to install client or server
          software on this node at this VMSINSTAL prompt. Enter YES
          to install both the client and server software. Enter NO to
          establish a client-only node.

          * Do you want to install the DECDFS01 V2.3 SERVER software on this node [YES]?

          After you answer these questions, VMSINSTAL displays the
          following message:

                  Product:       DFS
                  Producer:      DEC
                  Version:       2.0
                  Release Date:  20-JUN-1994

          The Product name DFS indicates a server software
          installation; the Product name DFS-CLIENT indicates a
          client software installation. The Product name is also
          the PAK name, which is checked in the next step.

          Step 12. Check for a License Product Authorization Key
          (PAK).

          VMSINSTAL checks for a registered and loaded DECdfs license
          PAK.

          * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

          Enter YES or press Return to indicate that the DECdfs
          license PAK is installed. Enter NO and press Return if
          the DECdfs license PAK is not installed.

          If you are installing DECdfs client software (you answered
          NO in step 11), the installation procedure looks for a PAK
          named DFS-CLIENT, which includes only the client. If you
          are installing DECdfs server software (you answered YES in
          step 11), the installation procedure looks for a PAK named
          DFS, which includes both server and client.

              You can continue to install DECdfs without a license, but
              the IVP cannot run and DECdfs cannot be started as part of
              the installation or when the installation finishes. After
              using the License Management Facility (LMF) to register and
              load the license PAK, you can start DECdfs or run the IVP.

              Step 13. Read informational messages.

              VMSINSTAL displays the following informational messages:

                       Installation will be complete in approximately 1 - 5 minutes
                       depending upon your configuration.

                       There are no more questions unless you choose to run the IVP.

          Step 14. Complete the DECdfs installation.

          If the installation has proceeded without errors on a node
          that does not have DECdfs running, VMSINSTAL displays the
          following text as it completes the installation of DECdfs:

                  The following line should be added to your SYSTARTUP command
                  file to automatically start DFS at system startup time:

             "@SYS$STARTUP:DFS$STARTUP.COM"

                  Put DFS$STARTUP after the statement that invokes the DECnet
                  startup command file (STARTNET.COM). The DECnet software
                  must be started before the DECdfs software.

                                               2.2 Installation Procedure


              Step 15. Run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP).

              If you answered NO to the question in step 7, proceed to
              step 15c.

              If you previously specified that you want to run the IVP
              after the installation and no errors occurred, VMSINSTAL
              starts DECdfs and displays the following message:

                  The Installation Verification Procedure will now be run.  Please
                  review preceding messages and take note of postinstallation actions
                  that may be required (such as editing the SYSTARTUP procedure).

              Begin the DECdfs IVP? [YES]

              Enter YES to start the IVP; enter NO to skip the IVP.
              VMSINSTAL displays a message that is specific for either a
              client-only (step 15a) or a server (step 15b) installation.
              The IVP prompts you for an access point name. Section 3.1
              describes how to run the IVP and Section B.1 includes an
              example of the IVP.

              Step 15a. Client-Only IVP.

              If you are verifying a client-only software installation,
              the IVP displays the following message and prompts you for
              an existing access point name (a DECdns name that you can
              get from the system manager of a DECdfs server node). The
              IVP uses an access point name to test a DECdfs mount and
              dismount operation.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The account you use to run the DECdfs client IVP needs
                read-access rights to the DECdns directory where the
                access point resides.

    Installation and Verification
    2.2 Installation Procedure


             This system will run as a DECdfs Client. To verify the
             installation, an Access Point must exist on a Server Node. You
             must have already ADDed this Access Point on one of your Server
             Nodes. To do this, use the DFS$CONTROL command ADD ACCESS_POINT on
             a Server Node.

           * Enter an Access Point name [] ? access_point_name

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             On Alpha systems running DECnet Phase IV, the
             following message is displayed:

                DNS is not available on this system. Therefore, the name of the node
                which serves this access point must also be entered. Note that for
                normal operation, the /NODE qualifier must be supplied on DFS MOUNT
                commands on this system.

              * Enter the node which serves this access point [] :

             ______________________________________________________

          The IVP verifies that the DECdfs client can communicate
          with the DECdfs server and at least one DECdns server. The
          IVP displays the following messages:

          $ DFSCP MOUNT access_point_name DFS$IVP_DISK
          %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, access_point_name mounted on _DFSC1001: (40FORD)
          $ DFSCP DISMOUNT DFS$IVP_DISK
          %DFS-S-DISMNT_SUCCESS, Dismount was successfully performed

          Step 15b. Server IVP.

          If you are verifying a server software installation, the
          IVP displays the following message and prompts you for a
          unique name to use as a temporary access point. This name
          must follow the DECdns naming conventions in use in your
          namespace. Ask the DECdns manager about your network naming
          conventions. The IVP uses this name to add the access
          point, mount and dismount the access point, and remove
          the access point. The IVP can then verify whether there is
          communication among the DECdfs clients and the DECdfs and
          DECdns servers.

                                               2.2 Installation Procedure


                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The account you use to run the DECdfs server IVP needs
                read and write access rights in the DECdns directory
                where you plan to add the temporary access point.

                ______________________________________________________

               This system will run as a DECdfs Server.  To verify the
               installation, an Access Point must be ADDed on the Server.
               This procedure creates an Access Point for its own use. You must
               supply a name for this Access Point that does not already exist
               and is consistent with the DECdns naming policy used in your network.

              * Enter an Access Point name [] ? access_point_name

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                On Alpha systems running DECnet Phase IV, the
                following additional message is displayed before the
                access point prompt:

                   Be sure to use the namespace prefix (e.g., DEC:.nam.nam).

                ______________________________________________________

              The IVP now executes while displaying the following
              messages:

              $ DFSCP ADD ACCESS_POINT access_point_name SYS$SYSDEVICE:[000000]
              $ DFSCP MOUNT access_point_name DFS$IVP_DISK
              %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, access_point_name mounted on _DFSC1001:
                 .
                 .
                 .
              $ DFSCP DISMOUNT DFS$IVP_DISK
              %DFS-S-DISMNT_SUCCESS, Dismount was successfully performed
              $ DFSCP REMOVE ACCESS_POINT access_point_name

              Step 15c. End the IVP.

              After the specific client or server IVP in step 15a or step
              15b, VMSINSTAL displays a message verifying that either
              the DECdfs software was installed successfully or the IVP
              failed. If you receive any error messages during the IVP,
              see the explanations in the DECdfs for OpenVMS Management
              Guide.

          VMSINSTAL displays the following message:

           Installation of DECDFS01 V2.3 completed at hh:mm.

          The following message then indicates that VMSINSTAL
          successfully completed installation and verification of
          the DECdfs software:

           VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

          If VMSINSTAL reports a failure, review the installation
          prerequisites. If you removed console media before you
          installed the software, replace the media in the console
          drive.

    2.3 Additional DECdfs Messages

          You may receive additional messages during a DECdfs
          installation. The following sections describe those DECdfs
          messages and the conditions that can cause them.

    2.3.1 Renaming Files Message

          If VMSINSTAL finds existing DECdfs files in any

                                              Postinstallation Procedures


              This chapter describes the procedures that can be performed
              after installing DECdfs on a system:

              o  Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

              o  Editing the local system startup command file

              o  Using DECdfs command files

              o  Setting additional DECnet and system parameters

              o  Using DECdfs security (OpenVMS proxy)

              o  Reinstalling DECdfs

              o  Changing clients to servers

              o  Changing servers to clients

              o  Deleting server software from client-only systems

              o  Checking OpenVMS Cluster systems after installing DECdfs
                 software

        3.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              The DECdfs software distribution kit contains a command
              procedure that verifies the correct installation and
              operation of DECdfs. The installation procedure places
              the procedure file, DFS$IVP.COM, in the SYS$TEST directory.
              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) tests whether
              the major components of DECdfs were installed correctly.
              Successful completion of the IVP indicates that the DECdfs
              software operates properly.

              You can run the IVP when you install the DECdfs software
              (as shown in steps 7 and 13 in Section 2.2) or at any time
              after the software is installed and running. If you want to
              run the IVP during the installation, VMSINSTAL invokes the
              IVP after the DECdfs components are moved to their target

                                          Postinstallation Procedures 3-1

 



    Postinstallation Procedures
    3.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedure


          directories. The procedure displays a message that the
          IVP is running. You then enter information that VMSINSTAL
          needs to complete the IVP. To the IVP independent of the
          installation procedure, supply the same information.

          To verify a client-only software installation, supply the
          name of an access point that was previously added on an
          accessible DECdfs server. The IVP uses this access point
          name to test a DECdfs mount and dismount operation. The IVP
          can then verify that the DECdfs client can communicate
          successfully with the DECdfs server and the Digital
          Distributed Name Service (DNS) server.

          To verify a server software installation, supply a unique,
          temporary access point name (a DECdns name, as discussed
          with the DECdns manager). The IVP uses this name to add
          the access point, mount and dismount the access point, and
          remove the access point from the DECdns namespace. This
          verifies successful communication among the DECdfs clients
          and the DECdfs server and DECdns server.

          To run the IVP, you need the account privileges SYSNAM,
          OPER, NETMBX, and TMPMBX, or the privilege SETPRV (allows
          all privileges to be set). On a DECdfs client, read access
          to the DECdns namespace directory that stores an access
          point name for that client is sufficient to run the
          IVP. You need read and write access rights in the DECdns
          namespace directory to run the IVP on a DECdfs server. Your
          DECdns manager grants these access rights. The IVP fails if
          you do not have the appropriate access rights.

          You need the read and write access rights for your user
          name on a specific DECnet node for the DECdns namespace
          directory that you plan to use. You need access to at
          least one DECdns directory (usually the directory where
          you plan to add access points) to perform an IVP on a
          DECdfs server. For example, if the DECdns manager grants
          the access rights to the SALES.WEST directory, you can
          add a unique access point name to that directory, such as
          SALES.WEST.DFSIVPTEST.

          To run the IVP independently from the installation
          procedure, enter the following command:

          $ @SYS$TEST:DFS$IVP

                      3.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedure


              You can delete the DFS$IVP.COM file without adversely
              affecting any DECdfs operations. However, Compaq recommends
              that you not delete this file as you may want to run the
              IVP later.

        3.2 Editing the Local System Startup Command File

              Edit your system startup command file if you want to start
              DECdfs automatically.

              For VAX/VMS Version 5.5-2 systems running DECnet
              Phase IV, the system startup command file is
              SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM.

              For other OpenVMS systems, the system startup command file
              is SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.

              Edit the file so that it invokes the DECdfs startup command
              file, SYS$STARTUP:DFS$STARTUP.COM, by adding the following
              line:

              @SYS$STARTUP:DFS$STARTUP.COM

              For DECnet Phase IV systems, insert this line after the
              statement that invokes the DECnet startup command file:

              STARTNET.COM.

              For DECnet Phase V systems, the network startup command
              file does not appear in the system startup file.

              DECnet software must be started before the DECdfs software.
              If you use a batch job to start the DECnet software, start
              the DECdfs software later in the same batch stream to
              ensure that the DECdfs software starts after the DECnet
              software.

              The following sample portion of a system startup file shows
              the statement that invokes the DECdfs startup command file.
              This statement executes the DFS$STARTUP command procedure
              in your SYS$STARTUP directory. The sample applies to both
              DECnet Phase IV and DECnet Phase V systems.

                             .
                             .

    3.3 Using DECdfs Command Files

          The DECdfs startup command procedure (DFS$STARTUP)
          executes two DECdfs command files: DFS$CONFIG.COM and
          DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM. Modify these files to suit your network
          environment.

          When DECdfs starts, the DFS$STARTUP.COM file invokes
          SYS$MANAGER:DFS$CONFIG.COM. This configuration file
          sets configuration parameters. To change the static
          DECdfs parameters, you must change the values for the
          parameters in the DFS$CONFIG.COM file. A related file named
          DFS$CONFIG.TEMPLATE contains the default settings for each
          parameter.

          The DFS$STARTUP.COM file also invokes
          SYS$STARTUP:DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM, which adds access points
          to the DECdfs server and mounts DECdfs client devices that
          are shared throughout the system.

          If you have files DFS$CONFIG.COM or DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM from
          earlier versions (prior to Version 2.3-1) of DECdfs, you
          may wish to process them as follows, because they can
          contain obsolete commands:

          1. Rename existing versions of DFS$CONFIG.COM and
             DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM files to DFS$CONFIG.OLD and
             DFS$SYSTARTUP.OLD, respectively.

              2. Create new DFS$*.COM files by copying the DECdfs Version
                 2.3-1 DFS$CONFIG.TEMPLATE file to DFS$CONFIG.COM and the
                 DFS$SYSTARTUP.TEMPLATE file to
                 DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM in the SYS$MANAGER directory.

              3. Copy any changed configuration and access point
                 information from DFS$CONFIG.OLD and DFS$SYSTARTUP.OLD
                 files into the new command files in the SYS$MANAGER
                 directory.

                 Do not copy any values for the following obsolete
                 parameters from old versions of DFS$CONFIG.COM:

                    DFS$PQL_BYTLM
                    DFS$PQL_FILLM
                    SET COMMUNICATION/CONNECTIONS_MAXIMUM
                    SET COMMUNICATION/SESSIONS_MAXIMUM
                    SET SERVER/FILES_MAXIMUM
                    SET SERVER/PERSONA_CACHE=(BLOCKS_THRESHOLD=xxx)

                 If you decide to use older DFS$*.COM files, Compaq
                 recommends that you move them to the SYS$MANAGER
                 directory if possible. Then edit the DFS$CONFIG.COM
                 file to remove the following lines:

                    DEFINE/SYSTEM DFS$PQL_FILLM "nn"
                    DEFINE/SYSTEM DFS$PQL_BYTLM "nn"
                    SET COMMUNICATION/CONNECTIONS_MAXIMUM=nn
                    SET COMMUNICATION/SESSIONS_MAXIMUM=nn
                    SET SERVER/FILES_MAXIMUM=nn
                    SET SERVER/PERSONA_CACHE=(BLOCKS_THRESHOLD=nn)

                 DECnet Phase V:

                 On DECnet Phase V systems, do not copy any of
                 the following parameters from old versions of
                 DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM:

                    SET/DEFINE EXECUTOR ALIAS NODE
                    SET OBJECT DFS$COM_ACP ALIAS OUTGOING ENABLED

                 Edit the DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM file to remove the following
                 NCP commands if they are present in the file:

                    SET/DEFINE EXECUTOR ALIAS NODE cluster-alias-name

             Failure to remove the obsolete commands from older
             DFS$CONFIG.COM and DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM files as
             recommended in this section does not affect DECdfs
             operation. However, any values entered for the
             preceding list of obsolete commands are meaningless
             and will not be displayed in response to the SHOW
             COMMUNICATION or SHOW SERVER commands.

             ______________________________________________________

          If your system is in a cluster, see Section 1.10.3 before
          you edit any startup command files.

          For more information, see the DECdfs for OpenVMS Management
          Guide.

    3.4 Setting Additional DECnet and System Parameters

          The DECdfs for OpenVMS software was designed to provide
          excellent performance using the default DECnet parameters
          and default RMS parameters. In some cases, however, you
          might enhance performance by setting several parameters.
          See Appendix C in the DECdfs for OpenVMS Management Guide
          for information about setting network and RMS parameters.

    3.5 Creating OpenVMS Proxy Accounts

          You must create OpenVMS proxy accounts, a DFS$DEFAULT
          account, or both, on DECdfs server systems to ensure that
          users on client systems can access a DECdfs server.

          To create proxy accounts, run AUTHORIZE on the server
          system and use the ADD/PROXY command to equate an end user
          on a DECdfs client system to a local user with appropriate
          rights and privileges.

          The following example assumes that the client end user
          already has an account (WPINE) on the server and an account
          on node WRKSTN:

              UAF> EXIT
              $

              Note that OpenVMS VAX Version 6.2 and later systems running
              DECnet Phase V provide long name support in the proxy
              database. On these systems, refer to the following example:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE
              UAF> ADD/PROXY FOO:.NET.WRKSTN::WPINE WPINE/DEFAULT
              UAF> EXIT
              $

              To provide access to your DECdfs server to users on client
              systems without explicit proxy, create a default DECdfs
              account (DFS$DEFAULT). To make this account available
              for use by DECdfs only (and not for logging in), create
              DFS$DEFAULT as a restricted account following the example
              in the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual. You can use the
              DFS$DEFAULT account as an example of how to create proxy
              accounts that can only be used for DECdfs access. Make
              sure you choose a user identification code (UIC) for the
              DFS$DEFAULT account that does not match the UIC of an
              existing user.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                When creating the DFS$DEFAULT account or a proxy
                account on a server, note the authorized privileges as
                well as the default privileges of the DFS$DEFAULT
                account and the proxy accounts. The authorized
                privileges can become effective for users, depending
                on the current privileges on the DECdfs client when
                the file was accessed.

                ______________________________________________________

              For more information about the DFS$DEFAULT account, see
              the DECdfs for OpenVMS Management Guide. For detailed
              information about creating proxy accounts, see the OpenVMS
              Guide to System Security and the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
              Network Management.

    3.5 Creating OpenVMS Proxy Accounts


             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Make sure you set up the proxy accounts so that
             DECdfs users have the necessary rights and privileges
             they need to gain access to files. If there is a
             DFS$DEFAULT account (and its DISUSER and CAPTIVE flags
             are not set), all the users who do not have explicit
             proxy in the proxy database file (NETPROXY.DAT on
             systems running DECnet Phase IV and NET$PROXY.DAT for
             DECnet Phase V) have only the rights and privileges of
             the DFS$DEFAULT account.

             ______________________________________________________

    3.6 Reinstalling DECdfs

          Although it is not usually necessary, you can reinstall the
          DECdfs software on your system at any time. Note that you
          must reinstall DECdfs if you change versions of OpenVMS or
          DECnet software. After you reinstall the DECdfs software,
          you need to reboot the system to use the DECdfs software if
          DECdfs drivers were previously loaded.

          When you reinstall DECdfs software, the installation
          procedure copies new DFS$CONFIG.TEMPLATE and
          DFS$SYSTARTUP.TEMPLATE files to the SYS$MANAGER directory.
          These files contain default DECdfs settings.

    3.7 Changing DECdfs Configurations

          With DECdfs Version 2.3-1, there are now two types of
          license: a full license called DFS, and a client-only
          license called DFS-CLIENT. To change a DECdfs client-
          only system to a server system may require loading and
          registering the full DFS license PAK, if that PAK is not
          already loaded.

          To change a DECdfs system from client-only to server (or
          server to client-only), edit the following lines in the
          SYS$STARTUP:DFS$STARTUP.COM file:

              $! Installation specific parameters:
              $!
              $ START_CLIENT_FLAG = "TRUE"
              $ START_SERVER_FLAG = "FALSE"
              $!
              $!
              $! Title = DFS$STARTUP.COM

              The START_CLIENT_FLAG = "TRUE" flag indicates that the
              DECdfs client software can be started on this system. When
              you convert from a client-only system to a server system,
              you must change the value of the flag START_SERVER_FLAG
              from "FALSE" to "TRUE." When you convert from a server
              system to a client-only system, you must change the value
              of the flag START_SERVER_FLAG from "TRUE" to "FALSE."

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The two flags, START_CLIENT_FLAG and START_SERVER_
                FLAG, are the only two lines that you should edit in
                the DFS$STARTUP.COM file.

                ______________________________________________________

        3.8 Deleting Server Software from Client-Only Systems

              The DECdfs installation procedure always copies all of the
              DECdfs software to your disk, whether you are installing
              server software or client-only software. If you do not
              want to install the server software, VMSINSTAL changes
              SYS$STARTUP:DFS$STARTUP.COM to prevent it from starting
              the server. To free disk space, delete the following server
              software from client-only systems:

              o  DFS$SERVER_ACP.EXE (in the SYS$SYSTEM directory)

              o  DFSSDRIVER.EXE (in the SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES directory)

              You can also save these files so that a client-only system
              can regain its server capability in the future. See
              Section 3.7 if you want to convert a client-only system
              to a server system.

    3.9 Checking OpenVMS Cluster Systems After Installing DECdfs


    3.9 Checking OpenVMS Cluster Systems After Installing DECdfs

          If you are installing DECdfs on a system in a cluster
          that uses a system-specific system disk, you must install
          DECdfs on each system disk on the cluster before you can
          run DECdfs in the cluster. See Section 1.10.3 for more
          information about OpenVMS Cluster systems.

          If you install DECdfs on an OpenVMS Cluster system that
          uses a common system disk, you do not need to install
          DECdfs on any other cluster members. However, you must
          install the appropriate licenses before running the IVP or
          running DECdfs in your cluster.

    3.10 Error Handling

          When you encounter a problem while installing or using
          the DECdfs for OpenVMS, running the installation and
          verification procedure (IVP), or installing the DECdfs or
          DECnet license Product Authorization Keys (PAKs), an error
          message appears on the screen. Appendix A in the DECdfs for
          OpenVMS Management Guide lists the DECdfs error messages.

          When you encounter problems while using the license PAK
          or the License Management Utility (LMF), see the OpenVMS
          License Management Utility Manual for a list of error
          messages. Determine which software issued the error message
          by its standard format (%facility-l-ident, text). For
          example, all DECdfs error messages begin with the %DFS-
          facility prefix.

          For additional problem-solving information, see Appendix B
          in the DECdfs for OpenVMS Management Guide.

    3.11 Problem Reporting

          If you encounter an error while using DECdfs and you cannot
          determine the cause, or if you believe that an error is
          caused by a problem in the DECdfs software, report the
          problem to Compaq Computer Corporation according to the
          terms of your product support contract.

          You can report a problem if an operation gives unexpected
          results or when you get undocumented or unknown failures
          using DECdfs commands. Gather all information possible
          about a problem and submit it with your report.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Many problem reports do not contain enough information
                to duplicate or identify the problem. Complete and
                concise information will help Compaq provide accurate
                service and a timely response to software problems.

                ______________________________________________________

              When you prepare to report a problem, please use the
              following guidelines:

              1. To ensure a timely response, describe one problem only
                 in each report.

              2. Describe as accurately as possible the state of the
                 system (such as specifying whether the system failed)
                 and the situation when the problem occurred. In this
                 description, include the version numbers of OpenVMS
                 and DECdfs software for both the client and the server.
                 Indicate the version number for each client and server
                 in a cluster. To determine these numbers, enter the
                 DFS$CONTROL command SHOW VERSION. If you cannot gain
                 access to the DFS$CONTROL program, enter the following
                 command at the DCL prompt to determine the DECdfs
                 version number for clients:

                 $ ANALYZE/IMAGE SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES:DFSCDRIVER.EXE

                 To determine the DECdfs version number for servers,
                 enter the following command:

                 $ ANALYZE/IMAGE SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES:DFSSDRIVER.EXE

                 The version numbers appear in the Image Identification
                 Information section, in the same line as the text "Image
                 File Identification."

              3. Pinpoint or narrow down the problem, if possible. Use
                 examples.

              4. Make suggestions that can help to isolate your problem.

              5. Remember to include listings of any command files and
                 other relevant data files.

              6. If possible, provide a listing of the user programs that
                 were running when the problem occurred.

          7. Send the following files from the SYS$MANAGER directory
             if possible:

             o  DFS$CONFIG.COM

             o  DFS$ERROR.LOG

             o  DFS$SYSTARTUP.COM

          8. Include source files or data files on machine-readable
             media (floppy diskette or magnetic tape) if possible.
             All media will be returned to you when your report is
             answered.

          9. If you have questions, state them as simply as possible
             and include all pertinent information so that a clear
             and correct answer can be provided.

         10. If you report a severe error (the system hangs or
             fails), include a description of the events that led
             to the problem, any messages received at the console, or
             other specific information.

         11. When a system fails, include a copy of the crash dump
             file (SYS$SYSTEM:SYSDUMP.DMP).

             **************************************************************************

            This system will run as a DECdfs Client. To verify the installation,
            you must supply the name of an access point now being served by a
            DFS server node.  This node and username should have proxy access
            to the file service named by the access point.

           * Enter an Access Point name [] ? DFSTEST:.MURZIM_SYS

           * Enter the node which serves this access point [] : MURZIM
          $ DFSCP MOUNT DFSTEST:.MURZIM_SYS DFS$IVP_DISK

              If available, enter the specification for an accessible directory within
              the filesystem identified by this access point, e.g. [JONES].  A read
              access on the directory will be tested.  If a valid proxy does not
              exist on the server for this node and user, a protection violation will
              be reported, but that will not terminate the IVP. If you enter a null
              specification, the read access will not be attempted.

           * Enter directory specification: [000000]
