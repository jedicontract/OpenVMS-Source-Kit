 Processors Not Supported:

 MicroVAX I, VAXstation I, VAX-11/725, VAX-11/782, VAXstation 8000

 Processor Restrictions:

 A TK50 Tape Drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000 and VAXs-
 tation 2000 systems.

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):




                                  3

 

 Development Option
 
 Disk space required for    110,000 blocks
 installation:
                            (57 Mbytes)

 Disk space required for    110,000 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (57 Mbytes)

 Run-Time Option
 
 Disk space required for    90,000 blocks
 installation:
                            (47 Mbytes)

 Disk space required for    90,000 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (47 Mbytes)

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 OPTIONAL HARDWARE

 DXML supports the optional vector processing hardware on the VAX 9000
 and VAX 6000 Model 400 and 500 series processors.

 Floating point intensive applications should be run on configurations
 with the appropriate hardware support for the floating point data types
 being used. Consult the base operating system SPD for the Floating Point
 Accelerator or other floating point hardware appropriate for your con-
 figuration.

 Vector Processing Hardware Requirements


                                  4

 

 The vector processor hardware option is required for proper execution
 of vector instructions. However, applications that are linked using
 the DXML vector libraries will run on all VAX-based processors, us-
 ing the VAX Vector Instruction Emulation Facility (VVIEF) that is sup-
 plied with OpenVMS. However, execution using the VVIEF may result in
 performance that is significantly slower than that achieved by relink-
 ing with the scalar library.

 CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

 This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
 and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions. The HARD-
 WARE REQUIREMENTS sections of this product's Software Product Descrip-
 tion and System Support Addendum detail any special hardware required
 by this product.

 *  V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXclus-
    ter Software Product Description (29.78.xx) and include CI, Eth-
    ernet, and Mixed Interconnect configurations.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
