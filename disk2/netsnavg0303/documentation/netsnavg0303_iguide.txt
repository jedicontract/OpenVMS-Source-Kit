          Netscape[TM] Navigator[TM] Gold Version 3.03 for OpenVMS[TM]
          VAX[TM] and OpenVMS Alpha[TM] Cover Letter

          August 1998

          Dear OpenVMS Customer:

          DIGITAL[TM] is pleased to provide you with the Netscape Navi-
          gator Gold Version 3.03 for OpenVMS Alpha (with Java[TM]), and
          Netscape Navigator Gold Version 3.03 for OpenVMS VAX (without
          Java).

          New features in Netscape Navigator Gold Version 3.03 include
          advanced HTML capabilities that allow users to drag and drop
          page links, graphics, Java applets (OpenVMS Alpha only), and
          JavaScript into e-mail and web pages. Netscape Navigator also
          contains a configurable graphical user interface (GUI) and an
          easy-to-use HTML editor for web page creation.

          Software Prerequisites

          The following software is required on your system before you
          install Netscape Navigator Gold for OpenVMS:

          o  OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2 or higher or
             OpenVMS VAX Version 6.1 or higher

          o  DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS

          o  DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 3.3 or higher

          Licensing

          Netscape Navigator does not require a separate license. The
          right to use Netscape Navigator Gold for OpenVMS is included
          under your DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS license.

          Reading the Release Notes Before the Installation

          Enter the following POLYCENTER Software Installation utility
          (PCSI) command to read the release notes on line before you
          begin the product installation:

             $ PRODUCT EXTRACT RELEASE_NOTES NS_NAV_EXPORT -
             _$ /SOURCE=disk:[directory] -
             _$ /FILE=NETSNAV0303.RELEASE_NOTES/BASE=VMS

          Netscape Navigator Gold for OpenVMS documentation (this cover
          letter, release notes, and Software Product Description) are
          installed in SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP]. The documentation is common to
          both VAX and Alpha.







          Installing Netscape Navigator Gold Version 3.03 for OpenVMS

          Enter the following command to invoke the POLYCENTER[TM] Soft-
          ware Installation utility (PCSI) to install Netscape Navigator
          Gold for OpenVMS:

             $ PRODUCT INSTALL NS_NAV_EXPORT -
             _$ /SOURCE=disk:[directory] /BASE=VMS

          After the installation is complete, Netscape Navigator Gold for
          OpenVMS executable files are located in 
          SYS$COMMON:[NETSCAPE.VAX]NETSCAPE-EXPORT.EXE for VAX and 
          SYS$COMMON:[NETSCAPE.ALPHA]NETSCAPE-JAVA.EXE for Alpha.

          Using Java in Netscape Navigator Gold Version 3.03 for OpenVMS
          Alpha

                                        NOTE

             Netscape Navigator Gold Version 3.03 for OpenVMS Alpha
             requires new Java class libraries. You must copy the new
             Java class library file (called JAVA_301.) to run Java in
             Version 3.03.

          You can make the JAVA_301. file available to Navigator in one of
          two ways:

          1. Copy JAVA_301. to the [.NETSCAPE] subdirectory of SYS$LOGIN.
             (By default, Navigator looks in that directory for this
             file.)

          2. Copy JAVA_301. to a directory other than [.NETSCAPE] and
             define the logical name NETSCAPE_CLASSPATH to point to that
             directory. For example:

                $ DEFINE NETSCAPE_CLASSPATH DEVICE:[DIRECTORY]JAVA_301

             Do not rename the Java class library file; it must be named
             JAVA_301. (no file type).

          Running Netscape Navigator

          Start Netscape Navigator Gold for OpenVMS Alpha using the RUN
          command. For example:

             $ RUN DISK$1:[SMITH]NETSCAPE-JAVA.EXE

          Start Netscape Navigator Gold for OpenVMS VAX using the RUN
          command. For example:

             $ RUN DISK$1:[SMITH]NETSCAPE-EXPORT.EXE

          The command procedures SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]NETSCAPE-EXPORT_
          STARTUP.COM (for VAX) and SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]NETSCAPE-JAVA_
          STARTUP.COM (for Alpha) create a systemwide foreign command when
          run at startup.

                                          2







          Export Restrictions

          Although the Netscape Navigator Gold Version 3.03 is available
          from DIGITAL in both 40-bit and 128-bit encryption scheme ver-
          sions, the Software Product Library contains only the 40-bit
          encryption version. The difference between 128- and 40-bit en-
          cryption is, most notably, that the U.S. government restricts
          the export of 128-bit encryption but not the export of 40-bit
          encryption. 128 bits and 40 bits refer to the size of the key
          used to encrypt the message. 128-bit encryption provides signif-
          icantly greater cryptographic protection than 40-bit encryption.

          The 128-bit Netscape Navigator Gold for OpenVMS is subject to
          export restrictions under the U.S. Department of Commerce's Ex-
          port Administration Regulations (EAR) and cannot be transmitted
          in any form outside the United States or to a foreign national
          in the United States without a valid Department of Commerce ex-
          port license. Please send e-mail to the following address to
          request a 128-bit version of Netscape Navigator:
