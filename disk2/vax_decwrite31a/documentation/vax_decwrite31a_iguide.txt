        ________________________________________________________________

                                                                 Preface



              DECwrite[TM] is an integrated document processing
              application that is available on a variety of hardware,
              operating, and windowing systems, referred to as
              platforms. Since DECwrite is supported by Digital's
              Network Application Services (NAS[TM]), which allow
              application software to work in a heterogeneous computer
              environment, you can transfer documents and use DECwrite
              in a similar fashion on all its platforms.

        Purpose of This Guide

              This guide describes how to install DECwrite Version 3.0
              on the OpenVMS[TM] operating system. You should review the
              entire guide, as well as the Read-Me-First letter, before
              you start the installation.

        Who Should Use This Guide

              This guide is for OpenVMS system managers or others
              responsible for installing system software. To install
              DECwrite software, you must have access to a privileged
              account such as the SYSTEM account, and you must be
              familiar with the OpenVMS installation procedure
              (VMSINSTAL).

        Structure of This Guide

              This guide has four chapters and one appendix.

              o  Chapter 1 describes installation prerequisites and
                 suggestions.

              o  Chapter 2 describes the installation procedure.

                                                                     vii

 






              o  Chapter 3 describes post-installation procedures and
                 general usage information.

              o  Chapter 4 describes the DECwrite Font Utility that
                 allows you to add, manage, and delete new fonts.

              o  Appendix A lists the files that are installed on the
                 system during a DECwrite installation.

              o  Appendix B shows a sample installation procedure for
                 reference purposes.

        User Information

              Use the user information for your DECwrite kit in the
              order shown in Figure 1.

              On the OpenVMS VAX[TM] platform, DECwrite also supplies
              two online files that contain information about CDA[TM]
              converter[1] options and error messages. See the DECwrite
              User's Guide for information about the location of these
              files.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Refer to your OpenVMS system documentation for
                guidelines about how to manage files and for
                information about how to maintain backup copies
                of documents, how to protect documents, and how
                to create directories where you can store related
                documents. That information is not covered in this
                guide.

                _____________________________________________________

                Preparing for DECwrite Installation on an OpenVMS System



              This chapter describes tasks that you must perform when
              installing DECwrite, and suggests the best methods for
              preparing for installation.

              Installing DECwrite is similar to installing other OpenVMS
              layered products. You should carry out the following
              steps:

              1. Take an inventory of the software distribution kit.

              2. Make sure that your system has the prerequisite
                 software and hardware.

              3. Register your DECwrite license according to the OpenVMS
                 License Registration section in this chapter.

              4. Prepare your system and its users for installation.

              5. Print and read the Release Notes.

              6. Perform the installation procedure and any necessary
                 post-installation procedures.

              7. Resume normal operations after you complete the
                 installation.

              You should allow between between 30 minutes and 2 hours
              and 15 minutes for the installation, depending on the
              speed of the system on which you are installing and
              the options you select. It takes 5 minutes to run the
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP).

        1.1 DECwrite Distribution Kit


        1.1 DECwrite Distribution Kit

              Each DECwrite distribution kit contains:

              o  A bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report
                 (BIL)

              o  The distribution media for the DECwrite software

              o  Documentation for the product

                 Media Only kits include the installation guide only.

              o  The Product Authorization Key (PAK)

              To ensure that you have a complete kit, check the kit
              contents against the bill of materials and the indented
              bills report.

              Check also that you received the correct distribution
              media, labeled as DECwrite V3.0.

              If your kit is damaged or if you find that parts of it are
              missing, contact your Digital[TM] representative.

        1.2 Prerequisite Software

              You must be running OpenVMS VAX Version 5.4-3 or higher
              or OpenVMS AXP[TM] Version 1.5 or higher. You must also
              be running DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Version 1.1 or
              higher.

              To install DECwrite you must have:

              o  A valid OpenVMS operating system configuration running
                 the minimum required version of OpenVMS as specified
                 above.

              o  DECwindows installed

                 To execute the IVP during the installation, DECwindows
                 Motif must also be running.

              Since DECwrite is a DECwindows Motif application, it can
              run in either of the following ways:

              o  Standalone execution - running the DECwindows Motif
                 display server and the client application (DECwrite) on
                 the same machine

        1-2 Preparing for DECwrite Installation on an OpenVMS System

 



                                               1.2 Prerequisite Software


              o  Remote execution - running the DECwindows Motif
                 display server and the client application (DECwrite) on
                 different machines

                 This requires that a valid DECwindows transport
                 mechanism also be installed. For example, these include
                 DECnet[TM], TCP/IP, and LAT[TM].

              For standalone execution, the following DECwindows
              components must be installed on the machine:

              o  OpenVMS DECwindows Compute Server (base kit, which
                 includes runtime support)

              o  OpenVMS DECwindows Device Support

              For remote execution in a noncluster environment, the
              following DECwindows components must be installed:

                 On the workstation:

                 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Compute Server (base kit, which
                    includes runtime support)

                 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Device Support

                 On the remote machine:

                 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Compute Server (base kit, which
                    includes runtime support)

                 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Device Support (optional)

                    Refer to the OpenVMS Installation Guide for
                    details.

        1.3 Prerequisite Hardware

              DECwrite supports all hardware configurations supported
              by an OpenVMS VAX Version 5.4-3 system or an OpenVMS AXP
              Version 1.5 system running DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
              Version 1.1, with a minimum of 12 MB of memory.

              See the DECwrite System Software Addendum (SSA) for
              details about supported hardware configurations.

        1.4 Privileged Account


        1.4 Privileged Account

              To install DECwrite, you must be logged into the system
              manager's account (SYSTEM), an account that has SETPRV, or
              an account with at least the following privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

              Note that the VMSINSTAL procedure turns off BYPASS
              privilege at the start of the installation.

        1.5 License Registration

              You should register and load the DECwrite license before
              you install DECwrite. The information you need is in the
              Product Authorization Key (PAK) shipped with DECwrite. The
              PAK is a paper certificate that contains data about your
              license.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If you do not register and load the license before
                installing DECwrite, the installation will complete
                but DECwrite will run only in demonstration mode.
                In demonstration mode you will not be able to save
                documents. You will be able to use DECwrite fully
                once you have registered and loaded the DECwrite
                PAK.

                _____________________________________________________

              There are several license types for DECwrite Version 3.0.
              While it is necessary to have only one license type active
              to use DECwrite, DECwrite checks for the existence of
              the other license types until it finds a valid license
              type. License failures for some of these other license
              types may be displayed to the operator's console and
              can be disregarded. These messages can be controlled
              system-wide for all products by defining the LMF$DISPLAY_
              OPCOM_MESSAGE logical name. For more information, see the
              OpenVMS License Management Utility manual.

                                                1.5 License Registration


              To register the license, first log in to a privileged
              account, such as the system manager's account, SYSTEM.
              Then choose one of the following procedures to perform the
              registration. The second method is faster for experienced
              users.

              o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When
                 prompted for information, respond with data from your
                 Product Authorization Key (PAK).

                 OR

              o  Issue the DCL commands LICENSE REGISTER and LICENSE
                 LOAD with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to
                 information on the PAK.

              For more information, see the OpenVMS License Management
              Utility manual.

        1.6 Startup Procedures

              If you have previously installed DECwrite, make sure you
              execute SYS$STARTUP:WRITE$STARTUP.COM before starting the
              new installation.

              If you have previously installed any of the International
              Lexicon kits or are reinstalling DECwrite, make sure you
              execute the
              SYS$STARTUP:LCI$STARTUP.COM procedure before starting the
              installation. This startup procedure defines the logical
              name LCI$LEXICONS. The installation procedure then uses
              this logical name to place the lexicon, or the spell check
              dictionary, files in their proper directories.

        1.7 VMScluster Considerations

              You can install DECwrite on a VMScluster.

              In a VMScluster[TM] with a common system disk, you
              can perform the installation on a single member of
              the cluster. After the installation is completed, each
              processor can share the same DECwrite software.

              You must check the number of global sections and global
              pages on each node in the VMScluster where you plan to
              install DECwrite. See the next section (see Section 1.8)
              for instructions.

        1.7 VMScluster Considerations


              See Chapter 3 for details about VMScluster post-
              installation instructions.

        1.8 System Quotas

              You use the VMSINSTAL command procedure to install
              DECwrite. For VMSINSTAL to run properly, there must
              be sufficient disk storage space and proper system
              parameter settings to accommodate the installation. This
              section describes the recommended disk space and system
              parameters.

        1.8.1 Disk Space Requirements

              Installing DECwrite requires a certain amount of disk
              storage space. Once the installation is complete, less
              storage space is required. Table 1-1 summarizes the
              storage requirements.

              The VMSINSTAL command has an Alternate Working Directory
              (AWD) option. This allows you to designate a di-
              rectory other than the default working directory
              (SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSUPD.product-name]) used by VMSINSTAL
              during the installation. This option is useful if there is
              little free space on the system disk.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The values in Table 1-1 apply only to the American
                English language variant. See the cover letter of
                the System Software Addendum (SSA) in your kit for
                the values appropriate to your product variant.

              be slightly less than these values, and may differ from
              the sample installation in Chapter 2.
              __________________________________________________________

              Use the DCL command SHOW DEVICE to determine the number
              of free blocks that are presently available on the system
              disk:

              SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

              If the system disk does not have enough free blocks for
              permanent use, delete unnecessary files to provide space.

              If the system disk has enough disk space for permanent
              use, but does not have enough free blocks at installation
              time, use any alternate working directory (AWD) on the
              device having the required AWD disk space. See Table 1-1
              for AWD disk space requirements.

        1.8 System Quotas


        1.8.2 System Parameter Values

              Digital recommends that the system parameter WSMAX be set
              to at least 4100. On a single-user workstation, it should
              be set higher, depending on the amount of workstation
              memory.

              Digital recommends that the account you use to install
              DECwrite must have a buffered I/O byte count limit (BYTLM)
              of 35 000. If necessary, change the value using the
              OpenVMS Authorize Utility. For example, to modify the
              BYTLM resource for the SYSTEM account, use this command:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE
              UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM/BYTLM=35000
              UAF> EXIT

              The DECwrite executable images and the shared libraries
              can be optionally installed at DECwrite startup time using
              the INSTALL utility. Table 1-2 lists the minimum system
              parameter values required to successfully install all
              these images and libraries.

              Table_1-2_Minimum_Required_Global_Pages_and_Sections______

              System_Parameter____Minimum_Value_________________________

              GBLPAGES            3116

              GBLSECTIONS_________9_____________________________________

              If GBLPAGES or GBLSECTIONS are below the recommended
              values, VMSINSTAL displays a message. Installing the
              DECwrite images will result in better performance.

              Make sure to adjust these system parameters before
              modifying and executing the DECwrite startup procedure
              WRITE$STARTUP.COM. See Chapter 3 for details.

              Since installing the DECwrite images and shared libraries
              is optional, you can safely continue the installation.

        1.8.2.1 Checking Parameter Values

              To check the value of one or more parameters, enter the
              following command at the DCL prompt:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN>

              At the SYSGEN> prompt, use the SHOW command to display the
              value of each system parameter.

              After you finish checking parameter values, use the EXIT
              command to return to DCL level.

              indicate that you must have at least 3116 unused global
              pages and 9 unused global sections available for the
              installation.

              To calculate the number of unused global pages and global
              sections in your system:

              1. Use the DCL F$GETSYI lexical function to determine the
                 number of free global pages and global sections:

                 $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")
                 $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")

              2. If the number of unused global pages is less than the
                 number specified in Table 1-2, you must increase the
                 value using the AUTOGEN command procedure (instructions
                 follow).

              The next section describes the procedures for changing
              these values. For more information, refer to the OpenVMS
              system management documentation.

        1.8.2.3 Changing Parameter Values with AUTOGEN

              You use the AUTOGEN command procedure to change system
              parameters. AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for
              parameters that need to be changed.

              To change system parameters with AUTOGEN:

              1. Edit the SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file.

        1.8 System Quotas


                 For example, to increase the setting for the GBLPAGES
                 system parameter by 2000, add this line to the file:

                 ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000

              2. Enter the following command to recalculate your system
                 parameters:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

                 AUTOGEN performs an automatic system shutdown and
                 reboots when it has finished. Rebooting your system
                 makes the new parameter values active.

              For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the
              instructions on modifying system parameters in the OpenVMS
              system management documentation.

        1.9 Style File Backup

              If there is a previous version of DECwrite installed on
              the system, and you have modified the style files provided
              with that version in the CDA$LIBRARY directory, make a
              backup copy of these style files before proceeding with
              the DECwrite installation.

              If you are installing the American English version of
              DECwrite, use this command:

              $ BACKUP/LOG CDA$LIBRARY:WR_*.DOC_STYLE STYLE_FILES.BCK/SAV

              If you are installing the British English version of
              DECwrite, use this command:

              $ BACKUP/LOG CDA$LIBRARY_EN_GB:WR_*.DOC_STYLE STYLE_FILES.BCK/SAV

              After you complete the installation, restore the files in
              the save set to the CDA$LIBRARY directory.

        1.10 System Disk Backup

              Make a backup copy of your system disk before you install
              DECwrite.

              For more information about backing up your system disk,
              refer to the OpenVMS system management documentation.

                                                     Installing DECwrite



              This chapter describes how to run the DECwrite installa-
              tion procedure. You should allow between 35 minutes and 2
              hours and 20 minutes to complete the entire installation
              and installation verification procedure (IVP), depending
              on the speed of the system on which you are installing
              DECwrite. Allow approximately 10 minutes for a font-only
              installation. Before you start installing DECwrite, make
              sure that your system meets the requirements outlined in
              Chapter 1.

              DECwrite supports language switching. You can install
              multiple translated versions of DECwrite on a single
              system. These translated versions are called language
              variants. This kit includes two DECwrite language
              variants: American English and British English. A language
              variant determines the defaults for attributes such as:

              o  The language used for menus and dialog boxes

              o  The Primary Language and Paper Size for new documents

                 DECwrite performs spell checking, hyphenation, and
                 sorting operations according to the primary language.

              o  The style files to use

              Select the appropriate language from the Language Options
              dialog box on the Session Manager Options menu before you
              start the installation.

              See the DECwrite Software Product Description (SPD) for a
              complete listing of the optional spell check dictionaries.

              DECwrite installs the language-specific files in the
              appropriate language-specific subdirectories. See
              Appendix A for a complete listing of these files and
              directories, plus a listing of all the files that a
              DECwrite installation installs or modifies. Section 2.2

                                                 Installing DECwrite 2-1

 






              describes how to locate and print the release notes for
              your DECwrite kit.

              Appendix B contains a printout of a typical installation
              procedure for your reference.

              You can install the entire DECwrite kit, with or without
              clip art, or just the screen fonts supplied by DECwrite.
              If you are installing DECwrite:

              o  In a cluster that includes workstations, install the
                 entire kit.

              o  On a standalone workstation that runs DECwrite locally,
                 install the entire kit.

              o  On a standalone workstation that always runs DECwrite
                 from a remote system, you need install only the screen
                 fonts. This allows the standalone workstation to run
                 DECwrite only from the remote system, and access the
                 full set of supported fonts.

              Similarly, if a standalone workstation user not running
              DECwrite wants to use either DECwindows Mail or the CDA
              Viewer to view documents containing equations, then
              you need to install the DECwrite screen fonts on that
              workstation.

        2.1 VMSINSTAL Requirements

              When you invoke the DCL command VMSINSTAL, it checks:

              o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account

              o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation

              o  Whether DECnet is up and running

              o  Whether any users are logged in to the system

              If VMSINSTAL detects a problem during the installation
              procedure, it notifies you and asks if you want to
              continue. To stop the installation and correct the
              problem, enter NO or press the Return key. After you have
              made the correction, you can restart the installation.

                                              2.1 VMSINSTAL Requirements


              To cancel the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. The installation procedure deletes all files
              it has created up to that point and exits. You can then
              restart the installation.

              Digital recommends that you refer to the section on the
              VMSINSTAL command procedure in your OpenVMS documentation
              set. In the OpenVMS base documentation set, see the
              OpenVMS System Manager's Manual. In the OpenVMS full
              documentation set, see the Guide to Setting Up an OpenVMS
              System.

        2.2 VMSINSTAL Procedure

              You must use the VMSINSTAL command procedure to install
              DECwrite. Follow these steps to begin the installation:

              1. Log in to a privileged account, such as the OpenVMS
                 system manager's account, SYSTEM.

              2. Ensure that there are no active users on the system.

              3. Start VMSINSTAL by entering a command in the following
                 format:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DECWRITE030 device-name OPTIONS N

                 where device-name is the device specification for the
                 distribution media, for example, MUA0:.

                 Specifying OPTIONS N indicates that you want to be
                 prompted to display or print the release notes.

                 Specifying OPTIONS AWD=device: where device: is
                 other than SYS$SYSDEVICE, allows you to re-direct
                 the creation of a temporary working directory used by
                 VMSINSTAL, from
                 SYS$COMMON:[SYSUPD.kit-name] to device:[000000.kit-
                 name].

                 You can also include the name of the root directory
                 where VMSINSTAL creates its working directory
                 by specifying the directory using the format:
                 OPTIONS AWD=device:[dir1.dir2.dir3]. Using this
                 specification the VMSINSTAL working directory is
                 device:[dir1.dir2.dir3].

        2.2 VMSINSTAL Procedure


                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If the device root directory [000000], or the
                specified root directory [dir1.dir2.dir3], already
                contains the subdirectory [.kit-name], VMSINSTAL
                will delete the subdirectory and subdirectory
                contents before it restores the first saveset from
                the media.

                _____________________________________________________

                 If you do not specify the AWD option, the installation
                 creates the temporary working directory on the system
                 disk by default.

                 VMSINSTAL has several other options, described in the
                 OpenVMS software installation documentation.

                 A message similar to the following appears on your
                 screen:

                         OpenVMS AXP Software Product Installation Procedure V1.5

                 Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

                 Your DECnet network is up and running.
                 The following processes are still active:
                   L
                   M
                   N

                   P
                 * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

                 DECwindows requires that DECnet be up and running.

              4. Enter YES and press < Return > to continue the
                 installation.

                 You are asked whether you need to back up your system
                 disk:

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                 Generally, you should back up your system disk before
                 any major software installation, as you were instructed
                 in Chapter 1. YES is the default answer.

              5. If you backed up your system disk recently, press the
                 Return key to continue.

                 Next, you receive instructions to mount the distribu-
                 tion media you specified when you invoked VMSINSTAL (in
                 this example, MUA0:). If you did not specify where you
                 would mount the distribution volumes, DECwrite prompts
                 you to identify where you have mounted them.

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on MUA0:.
                 * Are you ready?

              6. Mount the media, then enter YES and press < Return > to
                 indicate that you are ready to continue.

                 The following messages appear on your screen:

                 The following products will be processed:

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set A ...

              7. If you selected OPTIONS N when you first invoked the
                 VMSINSTAL procedure, a menu asks you how you want to
                 handle the release notes:

                 Release Notes Options:

                         1.  Display release notes
                         2.  Print release notes
                         3.  Both 1 and 2
                         4.  Do not display, print or copy release notes

                 * Select option [2]:

                 You should review the release notes before proceeding
                 with the installation. Choosing option 3 displays the
                 release notes and prints a copy.

                 If you choose an option that prints the release notes,
                 you are prompted for a print queue:

                 * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

              8. Press < Return > to print the release notes on
                 SYS$PRINT, or type a different active queue name and
                 press < Return >.

                 You are asked whether you want to continue with the
                 installation:

                 * Do you want to continue the installation?

              9. Enter YES to continue, otherwise press < Return >.

                 In either case, the release notes are copied to a file
                 in the SYS$HELP directory and you receive a message
                 similar to the following:

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been moved to SYS$HELP.

                 The text version of the release notes is contained in
                 the file DECWRITE030.RELEASE_NOTES in the SYS$HELP:
                 directory. The Bookreader version of the release
                 notes is contained in the file DECWRITE030_RELEASE_

                      You can install the DECwrite kit completely or just the
                      additional screen fonts used by DECwrite and the
                      DECwrite Equation Editor.

                      If you are installing this kit for use on a workstation, or on a
                      VMScluster that includes workstations, then you should install
                      the entire kit. This requires 62000 blocks.

                      If you are installing this kit on a workstation that will only run
                      DECwrite from a remote system, then only the screen font files are
                      needed. This requires 1268 blocks.

                 You can install the entire DECwrite kit or just
                 the screen fonts supplied by DECwrite. If you are
                 installing DECwrite:

                 o  In a cluster that includes workstations, install the
                    entire kit.

                 o  On a standalone workstation that runs DECwrite
                    locally, install the entire kit.

        2.2 VMSINSTAL Procedure


                 o  On a standalone workstation that always runs
                    DECwrite from a remote system, you need install
                    only the screen fonts. This allows the standalone
                    workstation to run DECwrite only from the remote
                    system, and access the full set of supported fonts.

                    For a listing of the fonts supplied by DECwrite, see
                    Appendix A.

                 You receive information about the number of blocks
                 required to install the entire kit, or to install only
                 the screen font files. You are then asked if you want
                 to install the entire kit:

                 * Do you want to install the entire kit [YES]? YES

                      This kit contains the user interface for both DECwrite/American
                      English and DECwrite/British English. You should install the
                      appropriate user interface  according the type of DECwrite
                      license you have purchased.

                      Choose one of the following:

                          1) DECwrite/American English user interface
                          2) DECwrite/British English user interface

                 * Enter choice [1]: 1

              10.Press < Return > if you are installing American
                 English. Enter 2 if you are installing British English.

                      Installing DECwrite/American English...
                      Installing DECwrite/Motif...

                 The screen displays:

                      This kit contains an optional clipart library composed of Encapsulated
                      PostScript pictures, DDIF pictures, and DDIF images. Its total
                      size is 10240 blocks.

                 * Do you want to install the clip art library [YES]?

              11.Press < Return > if you want to install the clip art
                 library.

                 You can install the clip art library in sys$sysdevice:[clipart]
                 by default, or you can install it in another location.
                 DECwrite asks you to identify a directory other than
                 the default directory where you want to place the clip
                 art files.

                 Specify a device and directory on which to install the clip art library

                 * Device and directory [sys$sysdevice:[clipart]]: USER:[PUBLISH.CLIPART]

              12.Enter the name of another directory where you want to
                 place the files,

                 OR

                 Press < Return > to accept the default directory. For
                 example:

                   You have chosen the device and directory USER:[PUBLISH.CLIPART]

                 * Is this correct [YES]?

              13.Press < Return > to confirm your choice of the
                 directory.

                 The installation also reinstalls the DECwrite style
                 files. The installation prompts you to make backup
                 copies if you have modified the original style files in
                 the CDA$LIBRARY: directory.

                     *************************************************************

                     Note: This installation will replace the DECwrite supplied
                     style files in CDA$LIBRARY. If you have made modifications to
                     these files, make backup copies before continuing. For
                     example:

                      $ backup/log cda$library:wr_*.doc_style style_files.bck/sav

                     *************************************************************

                 * Do you want to continue [YES]?

                 If you are installing a language variant of DECwrite
                 that already existed on your system, and if you
                 have made modifications in language-specific style
                 files located on CDA$LIBRARY_XX_YY, you should make
                 an additional backup copy of these files before
                 continuing. This applies, for example, if you have
                 modified the style files supplied with the French
                 version of DECwrite:

                 $ BACKUP/LOG CDA$LIBRARY_FR_FR:WR_*.DOC_STYLE STYLE_FILES_FR_FR.BCK/SAV

              14.Create the backup files if necessary. Press < Return >
                 once you have made the backup files, or if you do not
                 need to preserve them.

                The Session Manager's language setting should match
                the language of the DECwrite language variant you
                are installing.

                _____________________________________________________

                 To set the language, choose Language from the Session
                 Manager Options menu and choose the appropriate
                 language from the Language Options dialog box.

                 Note that other language variants have different PAKs.

                 The screen then displays:

                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

              18.If you are NOT installing DECwrite from a workstation,
                 then do not run the Installation Verification Procedure
                 (IVP). Instead, use a workstation to run the IVP after
                 the installation is completed.

                 If you are installing DECwrite from a workstation, but
                 one that is NOT running DECnet, then do not run the IVP
                 during the installation. Instead, execute the IVP from
                 the command line after the installation has completed,
                 making sure that a display device is defined using the
                 local transport. Use the SET DISPLAY command to define
                 a display device. See the OpenVMS DCL Dictionary for
                 information about this command.

                 If you are installing DECwrite from a workstation that
                 is running DECnet, answer YES.

                 If your workstation display is not defined, the

                 * Node name:

              19.Enter the node name of the workstation on which you
                 want to display the IVP.

                 This node name is used to issue a SET DISPLAY command
                 to the appropriate workstation. Note that this requires
                 that the Session Manager's security database be set
                 up properly and that nodes be defined properly in the
                 network databases. For example, if you are installing
                 DECwrite on your own workstation and you have SET HOST
                 0 from your own account to use the SYSTEM account,
                 then you must add 0::SYSTEM to the security database.
                 See the OpenVMS DECwindows Motif User's Guide for
                 information about the Session Manager's security
                 database.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The name of the system startup command file varies,
                depending on the OpenVMS version, and on whether
                you are installing DECwrite on an OpenVMS AXP or an
                OpenVMS VAX computer. See Chapter 3 for information
                about editing startup files.

                _____________________________________________________

              24.Add the listed commands to the system startup command
                 file for all nodes that will run DECwrite.

                 The screen also displays:

                      If you are installing this kit on a workstation, you should
                      restart DECwindows after the installation has completed:

                           @sys$startup:decw$startup restart

              25.Make sure you restart DECwindows after the installation
                 is complete.

                                   DECwrite Post-Installation Procedures



              This chapter describes tasks you must complete after you
              install DECwrite.

        3.1 Editing Startup Files

              You must edit the system startup command file and,
              optionally, the DECwrite startup command file before using
              DECwrite.

        3.1.1 Editing the System Startup File

              The name of the system startup command file varies,
              depending on the version of OpenVMS that is installed
              on the system. Table 3-1 shows the system startup command
              file names.

              Table_3-1_System_Startup_File_Names_______________________

              OpenVMS_Version____________File_Name______________________

              OpenVMS AXP Version 1.5    SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM
              or later

              OpenVMS VAX Version 5.4    SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM

              OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5    SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM

              OpenVMS VAX Version 6.0    SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM
              or_later__________________________________________________

              Add the following lines to the appropriate system startup
              command file:

        3.1 Editing Startup Files


              $ @SYS$STARTUP:WRITE$STARTUP.COM        ! DECwrite
              $ @SYS$STARTUP:LCI$STARTUP.COM          ! International Lexicons

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If an international spell checking dictionary has
                previously been installed, LCI$STARTUP.COM should
                already be in the system startup command file.

                _____________________________________________________

        3.1.2 Editing the DECwrite Startup File

              The DECwrite startup command file, WRITE$STARTUP.COM,
              defines the logical name WRITE$CLIPART to point to the
              DECwrite clip art directory. See the DECwrite User's Guide
              for information about the clip art files.

              The default at installation time is SYS$SYSDEVICE:[CLIPART].
              If you installed the clip art during the installation,
              or if you had the logical name WRITE$CLIPART previously
              defined, the installation automatically appends the
              correct WRITE$CLIPART logical name definition to
              WRITE$STARTUP.COM.

              By default, all the INSTALL commands in WRITE$STARTUP.COM
              are commented out. You can optionally remove the comments
              for the images and shared libraries you want to install.
              This improves system performance on systems where multiple
              users are running DECwrite concurrently.

              Make sure you have completed the steps in Section 1.8
              before executing WRITE$STARTUP.COM on a standalone system
              or on other nodes in a VMScluster.

        3.1.3 Examples Directory

              DECwrite provides an examples directory with demonstration
              documents, sample clip art, and other documents useful
              during DECwrite editing. The DECwrite startup command file
              defines the WRITE$EXAMPLES logical name to point to the
              DECwrite examples directory.

              For a complete list of all the examples files, read the
              file readme.txt in the write$examples directory.

                                               3.1 Editing Startup Files


        3.1.4 Editing the System Login Command Procedure

              When a user invokes a LiveLink[TM] application, DECwrite
              starts the application in a detached, or child, process.
              For performance reasons, the detached process does not
              execute the user's LOGIN.COM command file. This means
              that logical names define in the LOGIN.COM file are
              not accessible to the LiveLink application. To make
              the logical names accessible, user's must use the /JOB
              qualifier when defining logical names in your LOGIN.COM
              file.

              Note that LiveLink applications do execute the system
              login command file, SYLOGIN.COM. When editing this file,
              do not assume interactive use only. For example, use the
              lexical function F$MODE():

              $ IF F$MODE() .NES. "INTERACTIVE" THEN EXIT

              If there are logical names that you want to make
              accessible to all users, place the definitions before
              this line in the command file.

        3.2 Installing DECwrite on a Standalone System

              If you have installed DECwrite on a standalone worksta-
              tion, you must restart the DECwindows server in order to
              use the new screen fonts. Enter @SYS$STARTUP:DECW$STARTUP
              RESTART to restart the server.

                _____________________________________________________

        3.3 Installing DECwrite on a VMScluster

              To install DECwrite on a cluster with a common system
              disk, make sure you load the DECwrite license and the
              lexicon license appropriate to the language variant being
              installed on all nodes in the cluster.

        3.3 Installing DECwrite on a VMScluster


              To load the licenses, enter commands in the following
              format:

              $mc sysman
              SYSMAN> set environment/cluster/user=system
              Remote Password: <system password for the cluster nodes>
              SYSMAN> do license load LICENSE-NAME

              Where LICENSE-NAME is the language variant kit name.

              SYSMAN> do license load intl-lexicon

              Where intl-lexicon is the name of the spell lexicon.
              Table 3-2 lists the lexicons.

              SYSMAN> do @sys$startup:lci$startup
              SYSMAN> do @sys$startup:write$startup P1 [P2]
              SYSMAN> do @sys$manager:decw$starti18n P1 !DECwrite language variants
              SYSMAN> do @sys$startup:decw$startup restart ! Only required for workstations

              Where P1 is the name of the language parameter (for
              example, EN_GB for British English), and P2  is the
              default language used when defining write$examples, as
              described in Section 3.1.3.

        3.4 Rebooting the System

              You can reboot your system after you have installed
              DECwrite and reset the system parameters (if necessary).
              A system reboot verifies that DECwrite is ready for use,
              and establishes any new parameter settings. Note, however,
              that rebooting is optional.

        3.5 Performance and Tuning

              Performance concerns how fast DECwrite works for you
              when you are working in DECwrite. Tuning concerns how
              to set system parameters and otherwise run DECwrite so
              that DECwrite consumes resources optimally.

              CPU and memory are the major hardware resources af-
              fecting DECwrite performance. For more explanation, see
              Section 3.5.1.

              How you run DECwrite and the type of documents you are
              creating also affect performance. For more information on
              these factors, see Section 3.5.2.

              To optimize performance on OpenVMS systems, you should
              check the system parameters and the user account profile,
              as detailed in Section 3.5.3.

              Related to but not part of DECwrite performance are such
              aspects of your system as printing, disk space, network
              traffic, and so on. For example, printing performance
              depends on such factors as the type of printer you are
              using, the length of your document, and whether or not
              your document contains complex pictures or images.

        3.5 Performance and Tuning


        3.5.1 CPU and Memory

              CPU and memory are key to optimizing performance. The
              more memory you have and the faster the CPU, the better
              DECwrite will perform. As a rough guide, you need 1
              megabyte of memory for every 100 pages of text-only
              DECwrite document. Documents with images or graphics
              require more memory.

              Each desktop should have a local page disk with an
              initial page file size of approximately 80,000 blocks. A
              standalone workstation requires a minimum of 16 megabytes
              of physical memory.

              DECwrite V3.0 uses the OpenVMS Proactive Memory Reclamation
              feature to optimize memory usage.

        3.5.2 DECwrite Sessions

              At each DECwrite session, users can control some aspects
              of DECwrite performance.

        3.5.2.1 Running DECwrite

              If possible, users should run DECwrite as a detached
              process or directly from a DECterm window rather than
              spawning DECwrite. If a user spawns DECwrite, DECwrite
              shares process quotas with any other application running
              in or from that DECterm window.

              Display speed is affected by the graphics hardware
              used as well as by whether you are using X-terminals or
              workstations and the type of documents you are displaying.

        3.5.2.2 Images

              Bitmap images such as scanned photographs, screen
              captures, or images created by a paint program take up
              more memory and disk space than other parts of a DECwrite
              document. Documents containing images (both local copies
              of images and linked images) typically require large
              amounts of virtual memory during an editing session.

              The memory requirements for an image depend on its
              resolution, size, and depth, explained in Table 3-3.

              Even a large number of smaller images can require
              large amounts of memory. The main tuning parameters
              that affect DECwrite's memory usage are the AUTHORIZE
              working set quotas (WSDEFAULT, WSQUOTA, WSEXTENT), page
              file quota (PGFLQUO), and the virtual page count SYSGEN
              parameter (VIRTUALPAGECNT), described in Section 3.6.2 and
              Section 3.5.3.

              Use the SHOW PROCESS/CONT command while paging through a
              document's images to determine the virtual memory require-
              ments. Make sure the page file quota can accommodate the
              maximum number of virtual pages required. If users have
              very large images and if DECwrite displays messages about
              insufficient memory, increase the SYSGEN virtual page
              count parameter.

              In some cases, you may want to recommend to users that
              they change color images to black and white renditions in
              order to save space in memory (and on disk).

              A document containing large or multiple images requires
              much more time to print than a similar document with no
              images. While preparing to print a page with large images
              or several images, the printer may generate "stalled"
              messages, but still be working on printing that next page.

        3.5.2.3 Encapsulated PostScript Pictures

              Large Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) pictures can take a
              long time to display on your workstation. To avoid this
              problem, set the display off by setting the Encapsulated
              PostScript toggle in the Preferences dialog box to off.

                                              3.5 Performance and Tuning


        3.5.3 Post-Installation Tuning

              After you install DECwrite, you might want to adjust your
              system to enhance performance or lower the use of some
              system resources. For detailed information about tuning
              your OpenVMS system, see the Guide to OpenVMS Performance
              Management.

              DECwrite performance, particularly with large documents is
              dependent on the amount of memory available. Workstations
              running DECwrite should be tuned with this in mind. The
              critical parameters or quotas that control how much memory
              is available to user processes are:

              o  The working set related quotas in AUTHORIZE:

                    WSDEFAULT
                    WSQUOTA
                    WSEXTENT

              o  The page file quota in AUTHORIZE:

                    PGFLQUO

              o  The SYSGEN parameters:

                    VIRTUALPAGECNT
                    WSMAX

              Setting the working set quotas too low causes unnecessary
              paging and swapping. WSDEF and WSQUOTA should be
              approximately 256 and 512, respectively. Since other
              DECwindows processes, such as the window manager, run with
              a user's quotas, it is usually best to start processes
              with this small amount of memory and let them get more
              memory as they need it.

              In the case of a workstation, the general strategy is to
              let DECwrite access as much physical memory as possible.
              In order to maximize a process's use of physical memory,
              WSEXTENT can be set very high, close to the value of
              WSMAX. For example, on a 24 megabyte (MB) workstation
              with 48,000 pages of memory available, approximately 6,000
              pages are permanently allocated by VMS. The remaining
              42,000 pages are available to user processes.

                               DECwrite Post-Installation Procedures 3-9

 



        3.5 Performance and Tuning


              Start by using MODPARAMS.DAT and setting a MIN_WSMAX equal
              to the total number of physical pages on the system. Run
              AUTOGEN and AUTOGEN will recommend the highest reasonable
              value for WSMAX. In this example, AUTOGEN recommends a
              value of approximately 34,000. Edit MODPARAMS.DAT to
              use this recommended value. This sort of tuning would
              be unrealistic on most timesharing and server machines,
              but it is not unrealistic for a single-user workstation.

              When the DECwrite user is working with very large
              documents, such as those containing large color images,
              make sure VIRTUALPAGECNT is large enough. You can
              determine the virtual memory requirements of a DECwrite
              session by using SHOW PROCESS/CONTINUOUS and watching the
              value of Virtual Pages. A DECwrite user's page file quota,
              PGFLQUO, should be at least as large as VIRTUALPAGECNT and
              usually larger.

        3.6 User Account Requirements

              To use DECwrite, user accounts on your system must have
              certain privileges and quotas. The next two sections
              contain information about these requirements.

        3.6.1 Privileges

              To use DECwrite, each account must have at least the
              TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges. Use the OpenVMS Authorize
              Utility to determine whether users have the privileges
              they require.

        3.6.2 User Account Quotas

              You must make sure that the appropriate user accounts have
              sufficient quotas to be able to use DECwrite. Table 3-5
              summarizes minimum recommended process quotas.

              parameter WSEXTENT can be set equal to the value of WSMAX,
              for better performance.
              __________________________________________________________

        3.6.3 FileView Account Quotas

              If you want to run DECwrite from FileView, special tuning
              is required.

              FileView runs each task as a subprocess; therefore,
              your process quotas that are depleted by subprocess
              creation dictate how many FileView tasks you can run
              simultaneously.

              Before creating a new process, FileView checks these
              quotas and displays a warning in a dialog box if any are
              too low. The quota name is included in the message and can
              be one of the following:

              -  ASTLM

              -  BIOLM

              -  BYTLM

                              DECwrite Post-Installation Procedures 3-11

 



        3.6 User Account Requirements


              -  FILLM

              -  PGFLQUOTA

              -  PRCLM

              -  TQELM

              The most likely quotas to be consumed are your process
              limit (PRCLM) and buffered I/O byte count (BYTLM). To
              run DECwrite from FileView, your BYTLM quota should be a
              minimum of 35 000, with an additional 5000 for each task
              you want to be able to run simultaneously. To be able to
              run five simultaneous tasks, your PRCLM quota must be at
              least 5, and your BYLTM quota must be at least 55 000.
              Process creation can reduce remaining ASTCNT and BIOCNT by
              3, and FILCNT by 2. PGFLQUOTA usage is highly dependent on
              the task.

              FileView checks these quotas when creating its subpro-
              cesses; however, some quotas, such as PGFLQUOTA, are not
              consumed until the application is running. Therefore, if
              several applications are invoked at once, it is possible
              that PGFLQUOTA will be exhausted once the applications
              start up, without the error being detected by FileView. In
              this case, the applications can crash when the quota is
              exceeded.

              When process creation fails due to quota exhaustion,
              FileView marks the task as Pending in the Work in Progress
              box until one of the running tasks has completed. The
              Pending task then becomes Active. If you try to start
              an additional task after the quota message has been
              displayed, the task is marked Pending, and the Work
              in Progress box is displayed without a further warning
              message.

        3.6.4 Modifying User Account Quotas

              User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT. Use
              the Authorize Utility to verify and change user account
              quotas. First, set your directory to SYS$SYSTEM, and then
              run AUTHORIZE:

                                           3.6 User Account Requirements


              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE
              UAF>

              At the AUTHORIZE prompt (UAF>), use the SHOW command
              with an account name to check a particular account. For
              example:

              UAF> SHOW SMITH

              To change a quota, use the MODIFY command at the UAF>
              prompt. MODIFY has the following format:

              MODIFY account-name /quota-name=nnnn

              The following example changes the FILLM quota for the
              SMITH account and then exits from the utility:

              UAF> MODIFY SMITH /FILLM=10
              UAF> EXIT

              After you exit from the utility, the OpenVMS system
              displays messages indicating whether or not changes were
              made. Once you have finished making the changes, the users
              must log out and log in again for the new quotas to take
              effect.

              For more information about modifying account quotas, see
              the description of the Authorize Utility in the OpenVMS
              system management and operations documentation.

        3.7 Installation Verification Procedures

              The DECwrite Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
              runs automatically at the end of the DECwrite installation
              procedure if you enter YES to that option during the
              installation.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Before you run the IVP for any language, ensure that
                you correctly set the language you will use.

        3.7 Installation Verification Procedures


              If you did not enter YES, you may want to run the IVP
              later. If run later, the IVP needs two separate command
              procedures:

              $ @SYS$TEST:WRITE$IVP.COM         ! DECwrite
              $ @SYS$TEST:INTLxx$IVP.COM           ! Bundled spell checking dictionary

              where xx is the two letter code for the lexicon included
              in your DECwrite kit. Table 3-6 lists language codes used
              for bundled lexicons.

        3.8 Invoking DECwrite

              You can run DECwrite from the Session Manager, from
              FileView, or from the command line (DCL). To run DECwrite,
              you must use the appropriate display device. See your SSA
              for the list of supported display devices.

              To invoke a DECwrite language variant:

              1. Select the language corresponding to the DECwrite
                 language variant you want to use, by choosing Language
                 from the Session Manager Options menu and choosing the
                 appropriate language from the Language Options dialog
                 box.

              2. Run DECwrite using one of the methods described below.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If you switch to a language for which there is no
                DECwrite language variant, DECwrite will not run.

                If the DECwrite American English product variant is
                installed, that will be run instead.

                _____________________________________________________

        3.8.1 Running DECwrite from the Session Manager

              The installation automatically adds DECwrite as an item on
              the Session Manager Applications menu.

              To invoke DECwrite using a particular language:

              1. From the Session Manager, choose Customize   Language.

              2. Choose the appropriate language from the Session
                 Language list box.

              3. Choose DECwrite from the Session Manager's Applications
                 menu.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If you use a graphics terminal (VT1200, for
                example), you must first establish X-session on the
                node where DECwrite is installed; then, repeat the
                actions described in this section.

                _____________________________________________________

        3.8.2 Running DECwrite from FileView

              The installation adds DECwrite as an item on the FileView
              Applications menu. You should inform all users after the
              installation that DECwrite is available as an option on
              their FileView Applications menu.

              In FileView, if you double click on a file with the
              extension .doc or .doc_style, DECwrite is automatically
              invoked to edit that document.

              For information about adjusting quotas to run DECwrite in
              FileView, see Section 3.6.2.

        3.8 Invoking DECwrite


        3.8.3 Running DECwrite from DCL

              To run DECwrite from the DCL command line, enter at the $
              prompt:

              run sys$system:decwrite

              If you want to run DECwrite from your workstation in
              a language other than English, choose the appropriate
              language from the Session Language list on the Customize
              Language dialog box.

              You can also add a line to your login.com file to define a
              symbol to run DECwrite. For example:

              decwrite :== $ sys$system:decwrite

              You could, after logging out and then logging back in or
              running login.com, enter at the DCL $ prompt:

              decwrite filename

              This would invoke DECwrite and open the named document if
              it already exists, or display the New Document Attributes
              dialog box if you have specified a new document.

        3.9 DECwrite Sample Documents

              During installation, DECwrite places sample files for each
              of its components in the following directories:

              o  WRITE$EXAMPLES

              o  CHART$EXAMPLES

              The WRITE$$EXAMPLES directory contains:

              o  The documents used for the Getting Started exercises

              o  Several demonstration documents

              o  A sample equation for use with the DECwrite Equation
                 Editor

              o  Several sample Encapsulated PostScript files for use
                 with the DECwrite Link to Picture option

        3.10 Compiling Fonts on Remote Workstations

              Your DECwrite software kit includes bitmap definition font
              files. If you want to display DECwrite on a system not
              specifically supported by your software kit, you will need
              to compile and install the fonts on the remote system.

              For example, if you have purchased DECwrite for DEC
              OSF/1 AXP and want to display DECwrite on an OpenVMS
              workstation, follow the procedure in Section 3.10.1.

              On the other hand, if you have purchased DECwrite for
              OpenVMS and want to display DECwrite to an OpenVMS system
              where DECwrite is not installed, simply perform a font
              only installation, as described in the installation
              procedure in Section 2.2.

              After installing the DECwrite kit, the bitmap distribution
              format (.bdf) files can be found in the following
              directories:

              o  On OpenVMS systems:

                 SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.DECWRITE.FONTS]

              o  On DEC OSF/1 AXP systems:

                 /usr/lib/X11/fonts/private/75dpi
                 /usr/lib/X11/fonts/private/100dpi

              The following sections describe how to compile and install
              the DECwrite fonts on OpenVMS and DEC OSF/1 AXP displays,
              and on PCs using DECwindows.

              1. From a system account, copy the files with a .bdf
                 extension to a temporary working directory on the
                 OpenVMS workstation that will display DECwrite.

              2. Compile each of the files using command in the
                 following format:

                 $ FONT fontfilename.BDF

                 The FONT command creates a file with a .DECW$FONT file
                 extension.

              3. Copy all the 75 dpi font files into the 75 dpi font
                 area using the following command:

                 $ COPY/LOG *_75.DECW$FONT SYS$COMMON:[SYSFONT.DECW.USER_75DPI]

              4. Copy all the 100 dpi font files into the 100 dpi font
                 area using the following command:

                 $ COPY/LOG *_100.DECW$FONT SYS$COMMON:[SYSFONT.DECW.USER_100DPI]

              5. Update the DECwindows Motif server's font directory
                 file using the following command:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:DECW$MKFONTDIR

              6. Restart the DECwindows Motif server using the following
                 command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP RESTART

        3.10.2 Compiling and Installing Fonts on DEC OSF/1 AXP Systems

              To compile and install the fonts on a DEC OSF/1 AXP
              workstation:

              1. From a privileged account, copy the files with a .bdf
                 extension to a temporary working directory on the OSF/1
                 workstation that will display DECwrite.

              2. Compile each font file using a command in the following
                 format:

                 /usr/bin/dxfc fontfilename.bdf >fontfilename.pcf

              3. Copy all the 75 dpi font files into the 75 dpi font
                 area using the following command:

                 cp file.pcf /usr/lib/X11/fonts/private/75dpi/

              4. Copy all the 100 dpi font files into the 100 dpi font
                 area using this command:

                 cp file.pcf /usr/lib/X11/fonts/private/100dpi/

              5. Enter the following commands:

                 mkfontdir /usr/lib/X11/fonts/private/75dpi
                 mkfontdir /usr/lib/X11/fonts/private/100dpi

              6. Restart the DECwindows Motif server.

        3.10.3 Compiling and Installing Fonts on a PC DECwindows System

              To compile and install the fonts on a PC DECwindows
              system:

              1. Copy the .bdf files from the system where DECwrite
                 is installed to a directory on your PC. The PC file
                 names must be no more than eight characters followed
                 by a three-character extension. For example, PRESENT_
                 BULLETS24_75.BDF could be named PB2475.BDF. Make sure
                 the file names are unique so that existing files are
                 not overwritten.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                You need write access to the drive where you are
                compiling the font file.

                _____________________________________________________

              2. Compile the .bdf source file on the PATHWORKS system
                 service drive in one of the existing directories (for
                 example, use the \XSERVER\FONTS75 directory for 75 dpi
                 fonts), as follows:

                 C:\> CD M:\XSERVER\FONTS100
                 M:\XSERVER\FONTS100> COPY C:NEWFONT.BDF
                 M:\XSERVER\FONTS100> DWFONT NEWFONT.BDF

        3.11 Determining and Reporting Problems


        3.11 Determining and Reporting Problems

              If you encounter a problem while using DECwrite, report
              it to Digital. Depending on the nature of the problem
              and the type of support you have, you can take one of the
              following actions:

              o  Call Digital if your software contract or warranty
                 agreement entitles you to telephone support.

              o  Submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

              o  Fill out and submit a Reader's Comments form, if the
                 problem has to do with the DECwrite documentation.
                 There are Reader's Comments forms at the back of each
                 manual. Use the form from the manual in which you found
                 the error. Include the section and page number.

              Review the Software Product Description (SPD) and Warranty
              Addendum for warranty information. If you encounter a
              problem during the warranty period, report the problem as
              indicated above, or follow alternate instructions provided
              by Digital for reporting SPD nonconformance problems.

        4.1 Adding New Fonts to the Family Menu

              In addition to the fonts supplied by DECwrite and
              DECwindows, you may decide that you need additional fonts.
              You can add new fonts to your system by installing:

              o  One or more font kits from the DECfonts[TM] Typeface
                 Collection

              o  Fonts supplied by third parties

              o  Fonts that you create yourself

              Once you have installed the new fonts on your system, you
              can add their family names to the DECwrite Family menu.
              This chapter describes how to use the Font Utility to add
              new names to the Family menu.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                To perform the operations described in this guide,
                you must be logged in as SYSTEM on an OpenVMS
                system, and you must have privileges that allow
                you to copy files into protected areas and, on some
                systems, to restart the DECwindows Motif Display
                Server.

                _____________________________________________________

              Here are some important reminders:

              o  Fonts must be installed on the system before you can
                 add their names to the Family menu. Installing new
                 fonts involves copying, compiling, and placing the
                 various font files (screen font files, Adobe[R] Font
                 Metrics (AFM) files, and PostScript[R] outline files)
                 in their proper directories.

        4.1 Adding New Fonts to the Family Menu


              o  If you have installed a DECfonts font kit, its
                 installation procedure automatically copies, compiles,
                 and places all font files in the proper directories for
                 you.

              o  For third-party or user-created fonts, you must install
                 all font files yourself. Follow the instructions in
                 Section 4.3 before continuing.

                ______________________ Caution ______________________

                Since running the Font Utility can change the list
                of available fonts, instruct system users to recover
                any aborted DECwrite sessions before using the Font
                Utility. If users fail to do this before you run the
                Font Utility, subsequent recoveries may result in
                changes to the fonts in their documents.

                _____________________________________________________

        4.1.1 Overview

              There are several ways to use the Font Utility to add
              fonts to the DECwrite Family menu. In general, a Family
              menu entry corresponds to a font family, although large
              font families require more than one menu entry. This
              overview defines terms and discusses factors that can
              help you determine which method to use.

        4.1.1.1 Terms Used in This Chapter

              This section defines font-related terms used throughout
              this chapter.

              o  A font family is a collection of typefaces that
                 all share the same basic design but differ in
                 characteristics such as width, weight, and slant.
                 Examples of font families are Helvetica[R], Times[R],
                 and New Century Schoolbook.

                 Width (for example, narrow) indicates the thickness of
                 each character in the font, relative to those in other
                 fonts in the font family. Weight (for example, bold) is
                 the heaviness or blackness of the characters in a font.
                 Slant (for example, oblique) indicates whether the font
                 is upright or italicized.

        4-2 Using the Font Utility

 



                                 4.1 Adding New Fonts to the Family Menu


              o  A typeface is a visually consistent subset of the
                 font family that shares characteristics such as
                 width, weight, and slant. An example of a typeface
                 is Helvetica Narrow Bold Oblique.

              o  A font is an instance of a typeface, often of a single
                 size.

              Fonts installed on the system that meet Font Utility
              requirements for addition to the Family menu make up the
              New list. (For information on Font Utility requirements
              see Section 4.3 and Sections 4.4.2.5 and 4.4.2.6.) All
              fonts in the same family and with the same width and
              character set encoding are associated with a single entry
              in the New list. Fonts already associated with the Family
              menu make up the Menu list.

              Creating Family menu entries consists of moving fonts
              associated with a New list entry to form one or more
              entries on the Family menu. Deleting a Family menu entry
              reverses the process.

        4.1.1.2 Ways to Add Fonts

              The Font Utility provides the following ways to add new
              fonts:

              o  All at once, using defaults

                 The Font Utility adds all new fonts using default
                 weight and slant assignments.

                 This method is the simplest and fastest way to add new
                 fonts.

              o  Individually, using defaults

                 The Font Utility adds fonts that correspond to a single
                 entry on the New list using default weight and slant
                 assignments.

                 This method is useful if you installed many typefaces
                 on the system, but want to add only a few typefaces to

        4.1 Adding New Fonts to the Family Menu


                 The Font Utility adds fonts that correspond to a single
                 entry on the New list. You can assign weights and
                 slants for a Family menu entry from weights and slants
                 available for the New list entry and those that the
                 Font Utility recognizes.

                 Use this method to override the default assignments
                 that the Font Utility would normally make for weights
                 and slants.

              A wide range of font characteristics exist. The Font
              Utility recognizes the slants and weights[1] shown in
              Table 4-1.

              Examples in this chapter use the fonts supplied in the
              DECfonts LaserWriter[R] Emulation font kit. These fonts
              must first be installed on the system according to the
              instructions in the DECfonts Typeface Collection Font Kit
              Installation and User's Guide.

              ___________________
              [1]The DECfonts Typeface Collection may supply additional
                 slants and weights that the Font Utility will also

                 recognize.

        4.1.2 Adding Fonts From All New List Entries, Using Defaults

              Adding fonts all at once is the simplest and fastest way
              to add new fonts. The Font Utility adds all the fonts you
              have installed on your system using default assignments
              for weights and slants. This allows you to complete the
              process from the command line level without entering any
              further commands through the Font Utility.

              To add new fonts all at once, without any customization,
              start the Font Utility by following the instructions in
              Section 4.2.1, then run the Font Utility automatically.
              (See Example 4-1.)

              The Font Utility displays messages on your screen in the
              following format, then returns you to the command line:

              Adding all the following fonts:

                ITC Zapf Chancery
                ITC Zapf Dingbats
                Palatino

              All fonts successfully added

              Saving to file write$fonts.ini

              The write$fonts.ini file is the font configuration file
              created during DECwrite installation. The procedure
              automatically creates a backup copy of the file, called
              write$fonts.ini_backup.

        4.1 Adding New Fonts to the Family Menu


        4.1.3 Adding Fonts From a Single New List Entry

              The procedures in the next two sections describe how to
              add the fonts that correspond to a single entry on the
              New list. Both procedures require that you run the Font
              Utility interactively. This gives you access to all the
              Font Utility commands described in Section 4.2. These
              commands give you additional flexibility in working with
              fonts. For example:

              o  Before adding fonts, you can use the show command to
                 see the contents of the New list. This confirms that
                 font families have been installed on the system and are
                 available to be added to the DECwrite Family menu.

              o  Without leaving the Font Utility, you can use both the
                 add command (described in Section 4.1.3.1) to add fonts
                 with default weight and slant assignments, and the
                 add confirm command (described in Section 4.1.3.2) to
                 customize weight and slant assignments.

              o  You can also hide Family menu entries (so that they are
                 usable but do not appear on the menu), reveal hidden
                 entries, and rename Family menu entries.

        4.1.3.1 Using Defaults

              To add fonts one at a time using the defaults determined
              by the Font Utility:

              1. Start the Font Utility by following the instructions in
                 Section 4.2.1; run the Font Utility interactively.

                 The Font Utility starts up, then prompts you to enter a
                 command.

              2. Enter add, followed by the name of the New list entry
                 whose fonts you want to add, in quotation marks (" ").

                 For example:

                 Enter command> add "Palatino"

                 The Font Utility reports the Family menu entries that
                 it created, then prompts you again.

              3. Enter exit to leave the Font Utility.

                 The Font Utility asks if you want to replace the input
                 file with a newer version of the write$fonts.ini file.

                                 4.1 Adding New Fonts to the Family Menu


              4. Enter y.

                 The Font Utility confirms the creation of a new version
                 of the file write$fonts.ini, creates a backup version
                 of the file, then creates the new version and returns
                 you to the command line.

        4.1.3.2 Customizing

              You may want to customize the assignment of font weights
              and slants if:

              o  The New list entry has many choices available for
                 weight and slant

              o  You want a bold or italic font to be the normal font
                 when using DECwrite.

              To add a font that corresponds to a New list entry and
              customize the weight and slant assignments using the Font
              Utility:

              1. Start the Font Utility by following the instructions in
                 Section 4.2.1; run the Font Utility interactively.

                 The Font Utility starts up, then prompts you to enter a
                 command.

              2. Enter add confirm, followed by the name of the New list
                 entry whose fonts you want to add, in quotation marks
                 (" ").

                 For example:

                 Enter command> add confirm "Palatino"

                 The Font Utility displays the choices that are
                 available for the font weight, and the defaults it
                 has chosen, followed by a prompt asking if the choices
                 are correct. See Example 4-2 for an example of adding
                 fonts with customization.

              3. Do one of the following:

                 o  Enter y to accept the Font Utility defaults, then
                    proceed to step 5.

                 o  Enter n to make other assignments for the Family
                    menu entry, then continue at step 4.

                 o  Enter a to abandon the add command.

        4.1 Adding New Fonts to the Family Menu


              4. To specify new font weight settings:

                 a. Enter the number corresponding to the desired Normal
                    font weight, or enter 0 to refrain from choosing a
                    font for the normal setting.

                 b. Enter the number corresponding to the desired Bold
                    font weight, or enter 0.

                 c. Answer y at the prompt when you are sure your
                    choices are correct.

              5. Based on the choices displayed for the font slant, do
                 one of the following:

                 o  Enter y to accept the Font Utility defaults. The
                    Font Utility reports the Family menu entry that it
                    created. Proceed to step 7.

                 o  Enter n to make other assignments for the Family
                    menu entry, then continue at step 6.

                 o  Enter a to abandon the add command.

              6. To specify new font slant settings:

                 a. Enter the number corresponding to the desired
                    Upright font slant, or enter 0 to refrain from
                    choosing a font for the upright setting.

                 b. Enter the number corresponding to the desired Italic
                    font slant, or enter 0.

                 c. Answer y at the prompt when you are sure your
                    choices are correct. The Font Utility reports the
                    Family menu entry that it created.

              7. Make additional weight and slant assignments or enter
                 another command:

                 o  If more typefaces remain for the specified New
                    list entry, the Font Utility displays the remaining
                    choices for font weight, the defaults it has chosen,
                    and asks if the choices are correct. The process
                    starts again at step 3.

                 o  If all typefaces for the specified New list entry
                    are assigned to a Family menu entry, the Font
                    Utility prompts you for another command.

                                 4.1 Adding New Fonts to the Family Menu


                 You can use the rename command to change the Family
                 menu entry name assigned by the Font Utility to another
                 name.

              8. When you finish adding New list entries to the Menu
                 list, enter exit to leave the Font Utility.

                 The Font Utility asks if you want to replace the input
                 file with a newer version.

              9. Enter y.

                 The Font Utility confirms the creation of a new version
                 of the file write$fonts.ini, creates a backup version
                 of the file, then creates the new version and returns
                 you to the command line.

              Example 4-2 shows how the confirm option is used to
              customize font weight assignments for a hypothetical New
              list entry "Martian Miter".

              Note that in cases where Family menu entries would
              otherwise be ambiguous (for example, if more than
              two weights are available for typefaces with the same
              combination of family name, width, and character set
              encoding) the Font Utility appends weight names to the
              Family menu entry.

              Because more Martian Miter typefaces are available for
              assignment, the Font Utility continues. If you choose, you
              can make additional weight and slant assignments.

              If more than one character set encoding exists for
              typefaces of a font family that have the same width, the
              Font Utility also appends the name of the character set to
              the Family menu entry name.

              If the default name duplicates an existing Family menu
              entry name, the Font Utility uses a Family menu entry name
              that includes a number starting at 2 instead.

              For example, the name assignment might take the form:

              font_family width weight/weight n character_set

              where n begins at 2.

              You can use the rename command to change the assigned
              Family menu entry name to another name.

        4.2 Font Utility Commands and Descriptions

              The DECwrite Font Utility allows you to add, delete, and
              otherwise manage entries in the DECwrite Family menu. This
              chapter describes how to:

              o  Start the Font Utility

              o  Use all Font Utility commands

              o  Change characteristics of Family menu entries

              o  Reveal the Present Bullets hidden menu entry

        4.2.1 Starting the Font Utility

              To start the Font Utility, follow these steps:

              1. Set the display variable using the following command:

                 $ set display/create/node=nodename

                 For nodename, enter the node name of your workstation.

              2. Go to the proper directory using the following command:

                 $ set default sys$common:[syslib]

              3. Run the Font Utility.

                 You can run the Font Utility automatically or interac-
                 tively. By running the Font Utility interactively, you
                 have access to the full set of Font Utility commands.

                 o  To run the Font Utility automatically, use the
                    following command:

                    $ wfont :== $write$fontutil
                    $ wfont -n write$fonts.ini

                 o  To run the Font Utility interactively, use the
                    following command:

                    $ wfont :== $write$fontutil
                    $ wfont write$fonts.ini

                 In either case, you can specify an input file other
                 than the configuration file (write$fonts.ini).

                 You can also specify an output file, causing changes to
                 be saved to that file rather than to the input file.

        4.2 Font Utility Commands and Descriptions


                 Upon exiting, the Font Utility automatically creates a
                 backup version of the output file (or the input file if
                 an output file is not specified), then saves changes to
                 a new version of the output file.

                 For example, the following command causes changes to be
                 saved to an output file called newfonts.ini:

                 $ wfont write$fonts.ini newfonts.ini

        4.2.2 Font Utility Commands

              Font Utility commands use two font lists: the New list and
              the Menu list, as described in Section 4.1.1.1. Table 4-2
              describes all Font Utility commands.

              Note that all references to names on the New list or Menu
              list must be entered within quotation marks. The commands
              are not case sensitive, although some of their arguments
              may be.

                ______________________ Caution ______________________

                Recover any aborted DECwrite sessions before using
                the Font Utility, or the recovery may use the wrong
                fonts.

              add       add [confirm] "newlistentry"

                        If you specify newlistentry, the add command
                        creates one or more related entries on the Menu
                        list and removes the entry from the New list.

                        If you specify the confirm option, the Font
                        Utility displays all the weight and slant
                        choices for newlistentry and lets you confirm
                        default assignments or pick new assignments.

                        If you do not specify newlistentry, the add
                        command prompts for it with Family name:. If you
                        press Return without specifying a name, the add
                        command changes nothing.

              add new   add new [confirm]

                        The add new command moves all the fonts
                        associated with the New list to the Menu list.

                        If you specify the confirm option, the
                        Font Utility confirms the weight and slant
                        assignments as they are being added. If you
                        have many typefaces and do not need to customize
                        their font and weight assignments, omit the
                        confirm option to reduce the time required to
                        add typefaces.

              Command___Format,_Effects,_and_Descriptions_______________

              delete    delete "name"

                        Name can be a Menu list entry name or a font
                        family name with the same width and character
                        set encoding.

                        The delete command looks for name in the Menu
                        list. If name is found, the command removes the
                        Menu list entry and returns the associated fonts
                        to the New list.

                        If name is not found, the command looks for one
                        or more Menu list entries whose font family name
                        and width and character set encoding matches
                        name and returns these entries to the New List.

                        If you do not specify name, the delete command
                        prompts for it with Family name:. If you press
                        Return without specifying a name, the delete
                        command changes nothing.

              exit      exit [outfilename]

                        The exit command exits the Font Utility and
                        saves the changes that you made to outfilename.
                        If you do not specify outfilename, the Font
                        Utility saves the changes to the output file
                        named at startup or to the input file if you did
                        not specify an output file.

                        The Font Utility automatically creates a backup
                        copy of the previous version of the output file
                        and assigns it the extension .ini_backup.

                        The Font Utility may ask you to verify that
                        you want to write to the indicated file. If you
                        respond with yes, you exit the Font Utility and
                        your changes are saved. If you respond with no,
                        no action is taken and you can continue to use
                        the Font Utility.

              hide      hide "menulistentry"

                        The hide command hides menulistentry from the
                        Menu list. Hidden entries are available to
                        existing DECwrite files read in, but are not
                        displayed on the DECwrite Family menu. This
                        feature is useful for hiding the DECmath entries
                        from the menu, or for excluding other entries
                        without deleting them.

                        If you do not specify menulistentry, the hide
                        command prompts for it with Family name:. If you
                        press Return without specifying an entry, the
                        hide command changes nothing.

                        You can reverse the effects of the hide command
                        by using the reveal command.

              quit      quit

                        The quit command terminates the session without
                        saving changes.

                        If you made changes (by using any command except
                        show), the Font Utility prompts you to confirm
                        that you want to quit without saving your
                        changes. If you answer yes, the Font Utility
                        session terminates without saving any changes.
                        If you answer no, the utility saves no changes
                        and the Font Utility continues to run.

                        If you have made no changes, the Font Utility
                        session ends without asking for confirmation.

              rename    rename "oldmenulistentry" "newmenulistentry"

                        The rename command renames the indicated Menu
                        list entry to a new name.

                        The names you change with the rename command are
                        those displayed on the Family menu. Renaming a
                        Menu list entry does not change file names or
                        affect the internal pointers used to identify
                        fonts.

                        If you do not specify oldmenulistentry, the Font
                        Utility prompts From:. If you do not specify
                        newmenulistentry, the Font Utility prompts To:.

                        If you press Return at either prompt without
                        specifying an entry, no change is made, and you
                        can continue to run the Font Utility.

              reveal    reveal "menulistentry"

                        The reveal command makes previously hidden
                        menulistentry visible on the Family menu. See
                        the hide command for details about hidden Menu
                        list entries.

                        If you do not specify menulistentry, the reveal
                        command prompts for it with Family name:. If you
                        press Return without specifying an entry, the
                        utility displays nothing.

        4.2.3 Adding Point Sizes for Existing Family Menu Entries

              After you associate a typeface with a Family menu entry,
              you can provide additional point sizes for the typeface.
              This involves the following steps:

              1. Install, on the system, the new screen font files that
                 provide the new point sizes. See Section 4.3.

              2. Run the Font Utility interactively, as described in
                 Section 4.2.1.

              3. Enter delete, followed by the existing Family menu
                 entry in quotation marks (" ") to delete the entry from
                 the Family menu.

              6. To add the typeface back to the Family menu, enter add,
                 followed by the font family name with the same width
                 and character set encoding, in quotation marks.

                 The typeface, including the new point sizes, is added
                 to the Family menu, with the same slants and weights it
                 had previously.

              7. Enter exit to leave the Font Utility.

        4.2.4 Revealing the Present Bullets Hidden Menu List Entry

              The Present Bullets typeface is available but hidden on
              DECwrite Version 3.0 systems. This means that the Present
              Bullets typeface is available to existing files read in to
              the application, but is not displayed on the Family menu.

              To make the entry visible on the Family menu, use the
              reveal command as follows:

              1. Start the Font Utility by following the instructions in
                 Section 4.2.1. Run the Font Utility interactively.

                 The Font Utility starts up, then prompts you to enter a
                 command.

              2. Enter reveal, followed by the name of the entry you are
                 revealing, in quotation marks (" ").

                 For example:

                 Enter command> reveal "Present Bullets"

                 The Font Utility reports that the entry has been
                 revealed, then prompts you again.

              3. Enter exit.

                 The Font Utility asks if you want to replace the input
                 file with a newer version of write$fonts.ini.

              4. Enter y.

                 of the file, then returns you to the command line.


        4.3 Installing Third-Party Font Files

              To install third-party or user-created fonts, you must
              first create or copy the font files to your system,
              then compile and place the font files in the appropriate
              directories. If you are installing a DECfonts font kit,
              its installation procedure performs these operations for
              you.

              Three types of files are associated with each typeface:

              o  Screen font files (also called bitmap screen fonts),
                 for various point sizes, which contain bitmaps for
                 rendering each character on the screen. Screen font
                 files have the extension .bdf; they may also have the
                 extension .decw$bdf.

              o  An Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) file (also called a font
                 metrics file), which contains the dimensions of each
                 character so that characters can be displayed similarly
                 on the screen and in the PostScript output. AFM files
                 have the extension .afm.

              o  A PostScript outline file (also called a Type 1
                 outline font), which contains the definitions for each
                 character. These definitions allow a PostScript printer
                 to print a file that uses the typeface. PostScript
                 outline files have the extension .ps.

        4.3.1 Installing Fonts on an OpenVMS System

              To install new font files on an OpenVMS system:

              1. Copy or create the font files on your system.

              2. Compile the screen font files. At the command line,
                 enter font, followed by the name of each .bdf or
                 .decw$bdf screen font file, using the following format:

        4.3 Installing Third-Party Font Files


                 $ font filename-1.bdf
                 $ font filename-2.decw$bdf
                    .
                    .
                    .
                 $ font filename-n.bdf

                 This compiles each file with the OpenVMS Font Compiler
                 and creates a new file with the extension .decw$font.

              3. Copy the resulting .decw$font files to their target
                 areas (depending on whether the files are for 75 dpi or
                 100 dpi screens):

                 .decw$font    Target Area
                 files

                  75 dpi       sys$common:[sysfont.decw.user_75dpi]

                 100 dpi       sys$common:[sysfont.decw.user_100dpi]

              4. Copy the AFM files (extension .afm) and PostScript
                 outline files (extension .ps) to the target directory
                 sys$common:[sysfont.ps_font_metrics.user].

              5. If you are running DECwindows Motif Version 1.1 or
                 higher, update the font lookup file to point to both
                 the 75 dpi and 100 dpi target areas by entering the
                 following command:

                 $ @sys$update:decw$mkfontdir

                 Then, log out of your current windowing session and log
                 in again.

                                       4.4 Troubleshooting Font Problems


        4.4.2 Recovery Procedures

              The following sections provide detailed descriptions of
              problem recovery procedures.

        4.4.2.1 Setting the Display Variable

              Because the Font Utility uses DECwindows Motif to perform
              screen font lookups on your workstation, it must connect
              to your workstation in the same way as DECwrite.

              To set the display variable to connect to your worksta-
              tion, follow the instructions given in Section 4.2.1.

        4.4.2.2 Checking Security Access

              If you are using the Font Utility on a system other
              than the workstation where you run DECwrite, you must
              ensure that your workstation provides the correct security
              access.

              To check the security access on your workstation:

              1. From the DECwindows Session Manager, choose Options  
                 Security.

              2. If the node that you are using and your username are
                 not in the Security list on your workstation, add them,
                 and click on OK in the dialog box.

              3. Choose Options   Save Current Settings (or Customize  
                 Save Current Settings).

        4.4.2.3 Checking Session Login

              If you are using the Font Utility on a system other
              than the workstation where you run DECwrite, check
              your workstation's security access (by following the
              instructions in Section 4.4.2.2), and make sure that you
              are logged in to the workstation from the display window
              on that workstation.

        4.4.2.4 Restarting Your Windowing Session or Display Server

              After you install fonts on your workstation, you must log
              out of your windowing session and then log in again.

        4.4 Troubleshooting Font Problems


        4.4.2.5 Checking the Location of Screen Font, AFM, and
                PostScript Files

              If font families that you added to the system are not
              listed when you use the Font Utility show new or show
              menu commands, they may not be installed on the required
              systems or in the proper directories.

              Screen font files must be installed on the DECwindows
              server that you are using. This is typically your
              workstation. AFM files and PostScript outline files must
              be installed on the system that runs DECwrite and the Font
              Utility.

              Table 4-4 gives the correct directory locations for these
              files.

              For instructions on copying the files to the proper
              directories, see Section 4.3.

              Section 4.3 also describes the procedure you must follow
              to update the font lookup file or files.

                This section applies to third-party and user-defined
                fonts only. It does not apply to the DECfonts

                                       4.4 Troubleshooting Font Problems


              When you install third-party or user-defined fonts, data
              in the AFM files may be omitted or may not agree with
              corresponding data in the screen font and PostScript
              outline files. If this data does not agree, the Font
              Utility cannot see your newly installed fonts.

              To determine whether the data agrees, follow these steps:

              1. Display the screen font attributes.

              2. Edit the relevant AFM files to see, and possibly
                 correct, data fields.

              3. Edit the relevant PostScript files to see, and possibly
                 correct, data fields.

              Displaying Screen Font Attributes

              To display the screen font attributes:

              1. Run the DECwindows Notepad application.

              2. Choose Customize   Font.

                 The Font Attributes dialog box is displayed.

              3. In the Family list box, click on the name of your new
                 font.

                 The available pixel sizes for that font are displayed
                 in the Size List box. For 75 dpi fonts, the point
                 size and the pixel size are approximately the same.
                 For 100 dpi fonts, the point size is approximately
                 three-fourths of the pixel size shown.

              4. Click on any size.

                 The screen font attributes weight, slant, width,
                 spacing, and character set encoding are displayed.
                 These, and the family name, are the attributes that you
                 need to compare with the AFM attributes. See Table 4-5.

              Editing AFM and PostScript Outline Files

              For new fonts to appear in the Font Utility's New list,
              certain strings within the AFM and PostScript outline
              files, and corresponding attributes of the screen fonts,
              must agree.

        4.4 Troubleshooting Font Problems


              If you cannot list the added fonts when you use the Font
              Utility show new or show menu commands, or if you cannot
              print a document containing a new font, you must check
              the data in the AFM and PostScript outline files that
              correspond to the weight and slant you have chosen.

              Note that you need check only those files corresponding
              to the weights and slants assigned when the font is added
              to DECwrite, even though more weights and slants may be
              installed on the system.

              Table 4-5 shows the AFM, PostScript, and screen font
              attributes that must agree, with ITC Bookman[TM] Light
              Italic used as an example. Except where noted, the
              correspondence must be content specific, but is not case
              sensitive.

              The screen font attribute Char Set is composed of a
              registry string and an encoding string. In the third
              EncodingScheme example in Table 4-5, the registry string
              is DEC- and the encoding string is FONTSPECIFIC. In some
              cases, the registry string for the screen font is not
              present in the AFM EncodingScheme string, as illustrated
              by the example.

              The following AFM and screen font encoding schemes are
              recognized by the Font Utility:

        4.4 Troubleshooting Font Problems


              To view and edit the attributes of an AFM or a PostScript
              outline file:

              1. Set default to the sys$common:[sysfont.ps_font_
                 metrics.user] directory.

              2. Using a text editor, edit the appropriate AFM or
                 PostScript outline file.

              3. Locate and compare the strings listed in Table 4-5.

                 All AFM file strings and screen font attributes listed
                 in the table must agree.

                 An additional correspondence is necessary between the
                 FontName strings in the AFM and PostScript outline
                 files, and between the AFM FontName string and the name
                 of the PostScript outline file.

              4. Edit the files to ensure that the necessary correspond-
                 ences are made, as follows:

                 o  If AFM strings do not agree with the corresponding
                    screen font attributes, edit the appropriate AFM
                    strings.

                 o  If the AFM FontName string does not match the
                    PostScript outline file FontName string, edit the
                    PostScript outline file.

                 o  If the AFM FontName string does not correspond to
                    the name of the PostScript outline file, rename the
                    PostScript file to create the desired correspondence
                    by converting any uppercase characters to lowercase,
                    converting hyphens to underscores, and assigning the
                    file a .ps extension.

              Additional information on AFM files is available from
              Adobe Systems, Incorporated in the Adobe Font Metrics
              Files Specification, Version 3.0.

              Additional information on screen fonts is available in X
              Window System[TM], second edition by Robert W. Scheifler &
              James Gettys 1990, Digital Press. (See Part IV, X Logical
              Font Descriptions.)

              This appendix lists the files installed during a DECwrite
              installation. It contains the following information:

              o  Files installed on OpenVMS AXP systems

              o  Files installed on OpenVMS VAX systems

        A.1 Notes About the Files Installed by DECwrite

              Notes:

              1. The listings in this appendix do not include the clip
                 art files provided with DECwrite. These files are
                 listed in the DECwrite User's Guide.

              2. The SYS$HELP, SYS$MESSAGE, SYS$LIBRARY, CDA$LIBRARY,
                 and DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS directories are all language-
                 switched directories. DECwrite files for the American
                 English kit will be placed in the top-level directory.
                 Files for language variant kits will be placed in the
                 [.xx_yy] subdirectories of these directories.

              3. The names of the files installed depend on the DECwrite
                 language variant.

              4. For font-only installations, only the binary screen
                 fonts (*.decw$font) are installed. Note also that
                 OpenVMS DECwindows Motif already includes the DECwrite
                 Equation Editor fonts (dutch*.decw$font) and the
                 DECpresent Bullets font (present_bullets*.decw$font).

             You can install the DECwrite kit completely or just the
             additional screen fonts used by DECwrite and the
             DECwrite Equation Editor.

             If you are installing this kit for use on a workstation, or on a
             VMScluster that includes workstations, then you should install
             the entire kit. This requires 62000 blocks.

             If you are installing this kit on a workstation that will only run
             DECwrite from a remote system, then only the screen font files are
             needed. This requires 1268 blocks.

            The IVP edits a sample document. If the document looks the same as
            the illustration in the installation guide, then the installation
            has been successful. After the document window appears, click the
            mouse in the window to assign input focus, and type Alt/Q (hold
            down the Compose Character or "Alt" key and press Q) to exit
            DECwrite and complete the DECwrite portion of the IVP.

            Note that when executing this IVP for a particular DECwrite language
            variant, make sure to set the appropriate language in the Language
            dialog box on the Session Manager's Customization menu. See the
            installation guide for details.

            Set your language now before continuing with the IVP.
