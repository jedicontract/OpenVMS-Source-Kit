                                     Preparing for DEC PHIGS Installation


              This chapter describes the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing DEC PHIGS Version 3.1.

              This chapter will help you determine the following:

              o  Whether the system on which you will install DEC PHIGS
                 has the prerequisite software installed

              o  How to read the online release notes

              o  If installing DEC PHIGS from media, whether your
                 distribution kit includes all the components listed
                 on the Bill of Materials (BOM)

              o  How to register a software license

              o  The privileges required to perform the installation

              o  How much disk space you will need

              o  Whether the global pages and sections parameters are
                 defined properly

              o  Whether the process account quotas are defined correctly

              o  How to back up your system disk

        1.1 Prerequisite Software

              To install DEC PHIGS on a VAXstation workstation, you must
              have the following products installed:

              o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System Version 5.5-2 or higher

              o  DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX Version 1.2 or higher

              o  DEC C[TM] Version 4.0 or higher

                 This software must be installed if you are using OpenVMS
                 VAX Version 5.5-2; however, no DEC C license is required
                 to run DEC PHIGS.


                                 Preparing for DEC PHIGS Installation 1-1

 







          You must also have the following OpenVMS VAX classes:

          o  OpenVMS VAX required save set

          o  Network support-where full DECwindows network
             functionality is necessary

          o  Programming support-required by the DEC PHIGS
             development kit

          If you are using DEC PHIGS on a workstation, Digital
          recommends the OpenVMS VAX class for workstation support.

    1.2 Online Release Notes

          DEC PHIGS provides online release notes. You can access
          release notes during the installation procedure when you
          invoke VMSINSTAL with the OPTIONS N parameter. This option
          lets you read or print the release notes before installing
          DEC PHIGS.

          To obtain the DEC PHIGS release notes for the development
          or run-time-only kit after installation, print the
          following files:

          o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGS031.RELEASE_NOTES (ASCII format)

          o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGS031_RELEASE_NOTES.PS (PostScript[R]
             format)

          o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGSJ031.RELEASE_NOTES

          o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGSJ031_RELEASE_NOTES.PS

    1.3 Media Distribution Kit

          Your bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report
          (BIL) specify the number and contents of your media.
          Be sure to check the contents of your kit against this
          information. If your kit is damaged or if you find that
          parts of it are missing, call your Digital representative.
          For more information on how to mount distribution media,
          see your processor-specific installation/operations guide,
          which also details several options for the installation
          procedure.

        1.4 License Registration

              Before you install and run DEC PHIGS Version 3.1 on a newly
              licensed node or cluster, you must first register a License
              Product Authorization Key (License PAK) using the License
              Management Facility (LMF). The PAK is a paper certificate
              that contains information about the license that enables
              you to use the software. The License PAK is shipped with
              the kit if you ordered the license and media together;
              otherwise, the PAK is shipped separately to the location
              specified on your license order.

              If you are installing DEC PHIGS as an update on a node
              or cluster already licensed for this software, you
              have already completed the License PAK registration
              requirements. If you are installing prerequisite or
              optional software along with DEC PHIGS, review the PAK
              status and install the PAKs for this prerequisite or
              optional software before you install DEC PHIGS.

              To register a license under the OpenVMS operating system,
              first log in to the system manager's account, SYSTEM. You
              can then register the license in one of two ways:

              o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it
                 prompts you for information, respond with the data from
                 your License PAK.

              o  Type the LICENSE REGISTER command with the qualifiers
                 corresponding to the License PAK information.

              If you plan to use DEC PHIGS on more than one node in a
              VAXcluster[TM] configuration, you will need to perform a
              license load on the other nodes after you complete this
              installation. See Section 3.1 for details.

              For complete information on using LMF, see the OpenVMS
              License Management Utility Manual.

        1.5 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The following sections describe the various requirements
              for installing DEC PHIGS. The installation takes
              approximately 5 to 30 minutes, depending on your system
              configuration.

    1.5.1 Privileges

          To install DEC PHIGS, you must be logged in to an account
          that has the SETPRV privilege, or at least the following
          privileges:

          o  CMKRNL

          o  WORLD

          o  SYSPRV

          When you invoke VMSINSTAL to begin the installation
          procedure, VMSINSTAL turns off the BYPASS privilege.

          After installation, each user account must have at least
          the TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges to use DEC PHIGS. Use the
          OpenVMS Authorize Utility to determine whether users have
          the privileges they require.

    1.5.2 Disk Space

          The DEC PHIGS requirements for free disk storage space
          are different during installation and after installation.
          Table 1-1 summarizes these requirements.

                _______________________ Caution _______________________

                You must ensure that your system has the necessary
                global page and global section SYSGEN quotas for the
                installation. Otherwise, the DCL tables may become
                corrupted in certain situations.
                ______________________________________________________

        1.5.3 Global Pages and Global Sections System Parameters

              The installation of DEC PHIGS requires minimum values for
              the system parameters defining the global pages and global
              sections. These values are shown in Table 1-2. Depending
              on the kinds of programs and applications running at your
              site, you may need to define larger values.

              ___________________________________________________________
              Table 1-2 Minimum Required System Parameter Values
              ___________________________________________________________

              ___________________________________________________________
              [1]The n variable refers to the system parameter values
              that are currently in use. To install DEC PHIGS, you must
              increase those values by the number indicated.
              These dynamic system parameters must be set permanently to
              values equal to or greater than the values listed. Do not
              decrease these values after the installation.
              ___________________________________________________________

              The following sections describe how to:

              o  Determine the number of global pages and global sections
                 available

              o  Determine the global pages and global sections used

              o  Modify the global pages parameter

              o  Modify the global sections parameter

              o  Recalculate the global pages and global sections
                 parameters in order to take the new values into account





                                 Preparing for DEC PHIGS Installation 1-5

 







    1.5.3.1 Determining the Global Pages and Global Sections
            Available

          You can determine the available global pagelets and global
          sections using the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical
          function. The following example shows how to display this
          information on your terminal (the default for SYS$OUTPUT):

          $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES") <Return>
          15848
          $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS") <Return>
          24

          If the values displayed by the system are greater than the
          values in Table 1-2, you do not need to increase the values
          for these parameters. If the values of free global pages
          or global sections are less than the values in Table 1-2,
          you must increase the parameter values, as described in the
          following sections.

          You can also determine the number of global sections
          available using the following procedure:

          1. Invoke the SYSGEN Utility:

             $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN <Return>
             SYSGEN> USE CURRENT <Return>

          2. Determine the number of global sections available:

             SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS <Return>

      Parameter Name     Current   Default   Minimum   Maximum Unit  Dynamic
      --------------     -------   -------   -------   ------- ----  -------
      GBLSECTIONS         512       250        20      4095 Sections

             The first number displayed is the current number of
             global sections. Compare this number to the number of
             global sections in use displayed by the OpenVMS Install
             Utility (see Section 1.5.3.2).

          3. Exit from the SYSGEN Utility:

             SYSGEN> EXIT <Return>







    1-6 Preparing for DEC PHIGS Installation

 







    1.5.3.2 Determining the Global Pages and Global Sections Used

          To determine the global pages and global sections used:

          1. Invoke the OpenVMS Install Utility:

             $ INSTALL :== $INSTALL/COMMAND_MODE <Return>
             $ INSTALL <Return>

          2. Determine the number of global pages used:

             INSTALL> LIST/GLOBAL/SUMMARY <Return>

                     Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

             nn Global Sections Used,  nnnn/nnnn Global Pages Used/Unused

             INSTALL> EXIT <Return>

             The system displays a summary of the number of global
             sections used, the number of global pages used, and the
             number of global pages available.

          3. Exit from the OpenVMS Install Utility:

             INSTALL> EXIT <Return>

    1.5.3.3 Modifying the Global Pages Parameter

          To modify the number of global pages:

          1. If there are fewer than 6500 pages available, modify the
             GBLPAGES system parameter.

             You can modify the GBLPAGES parameter by editing the
             SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file. To change a parameter
             value in this file, delete the current value and enter
             the new value. (Another way of allocating space is to
             delete an existing known image with the OpenVMS Install
             Utility.)

             To modify GBLPAGES, use ADD_GBLPAGES as shown, where n
             is the number of global pages to add:

             ADD_GBLPAGES = n

             Note that when you set the page file quota, you should
             not use a value that exceeds the amount of page file
             space available on the system.

          2. Exit the editor.

                                 Preparing for DEC PHIGS Installation 1-7

 







          3. Update the GBLPAGES parameter by invoking the AUTOGEN
             command procedure described in Section 1.5.3.5.

    1.5.3.4 Modifying the Global Sections Parameter

          To modify the number of global sections:

          1. If the number of global sections in use plus 42 exceeds
             the current number of global sections, modify the
             GBLSECTIONS parameter.

             You can modify the GBLSECTIONS parameter by editing the
             SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file. To change a parameter
             value in this file, delete the current value and enter
             the new value.

             To modify GBLSECTIONS, use ADD_GBLSECTIONS as shown,
             where n is the number of global sections to add:

             ADD_GBLSECTIONS = n

             Note that when you set the page file quota, you should
             not use a value that exceeds the amount of page file
             space available on the system.

          2. Exit the editor.

          3. Update the GBLSECTIONS parameter by invoking the AUTOGEN
             command procedure described in Section 1.5.3.5.

    1.5.3.5 Recalculating the Global Pages and Global Sections
            Parameters
             
          To update the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS parameters, invoke
          the AUTOGEN command procedure, SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM:
          
          $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT <Return>

          AUTOGEN automatically recalculates the parameters with
          the values you defined manually. When you specify REBOOT,
          AUTOGEN performs an automatic system shutdown and then
          reboots the system. Any users logged on to the system are
          immediately disconnected during the shutdown.

          AUTOGEN also automatically adjusts some of the SYSGEN
          parameters, based on the consumption of resources since
          the last reboot. If you do not want to take advantage of
          this automatic adjustment, include the NOFEEDBACK qualifier
          on the AUTOGEN command line.

              For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the OpenVMS
              System Management Subkit.

        1.5.4 Other System Parameters

              The installation for DEC PHIGS requires that you increase
              the values of the CLISYMTBL and CTLPAGES system parameters.
              Once the installation is complete, you can decrease these
              values to ensure efficient system performance.

        1.5.5 User Account Quotas

              To use DEC PHIGS, you must have an account with an open
              file limit (FILLM) of at least 20. In addition, if you are
              using the Ada binding, the FILLM should be set to 2000, and
              the BYTLM should be set to 200,000.

              Using the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE), you
              can compare the current values of these quotas with
              the requirements for DEC PHIGS. The account used in the
              following example is the SYSTEM account:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

              To change the values of these quotas, use the MODIFY
              command. For more information, see the OpenVMS System
              Management Utilities Reference Manual.

        1.6 Backing Up Your System Disk

              Digital recommends that you back up your system disk,
              before installing any software. Use the backup procedures
              that are established at your site. For details on
              performing a backup, see the section on the Backup Utility
              in the OpenVMS System Management Subkit.

                                                     Installing DEC PHIGS


              This chapter describes the DEC PHIGS installation procedure
              and the operations you may need to perform after the
              installation. For a list of the files and directories
              created during the installation procedure, see Appendix A.
              For sample development kit and run-time-only installations,
              refer to Appendix B.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              exits. You can then start the installation again.
              Attempting to link programs against the DEC PHIGS run-time
              library results in link errors.

        2.1 Installation Procedure

              Before you install DEC PHIGS, Digital recommends that
              you back up your system disk. Once you have done so,
              you can begin the installation. The installation takes
              approximately 5 to 30 minutes, depending on your system
              configuration.

              You should not install DEC PHIGS run-time Version 3.1 if
              you have already installed the full development kit of DEC
              PHIGS Version 3.1. If you do, the installation procedure
              will overwrite the development kit with the run-time-only
              kit. To determine which version of DEC PHIGS is currently
              installed, type the following DCL command:

      $ ANALYZE/IMAGE/INTERACTIVE/HEADER SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]PHIGS$RTL <Return>

              The procedure for installing DEC PHIGS is:

              1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
                 device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

                 Digital recommends that you use the system manager's
                 account.

                 Username: SYSTEM <Return>
                 Password:         <Return>
                 $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <Return>

          2. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

             When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

             o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account.
                You should install software from the system manager's
                account with your default device and directory set to
                SYS$UPDATE.

             o  The installing account has adequate:

                   Disk space
                   Global pages
                   Global sections
                   Account quotas

                 o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
                    VMSINSTAL requires the following minimum quota
                    values:

                       ASTLM = 24
                       BIOLM = 18
                       BYTLM = 18000
                       DIOLM = 18
                       ENQLM = 30
                       FILLM = 20

                 o  Whether the following conditions exist:

                    -  DECnet[TM] network is up and running.

                    -  Users are logged in to the system.

                 If VMSINSTAL detects problems, you will be asked whether
                 you want to continue the installation. You should
                 correct these problems before resuming the installation
                 procedure. If you want to continue, type YES. If you
                 want to stop the installation, press Return.

                 To invoke the VMSINSTAL command procedure, enter:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name OPTIONS N <Return>

                 The VMSINSTAL parameters are:

                 saveset-name
                 The installation name for the component. For the DEC
                 PHIGS development kit, use the name:

                 DECPHIGS031


    2-2 Installing DEC PHIGS

 







             For the DEC PHIGS run-time-only kit, use the name:

             DECPHIGSRTO031

             ddcu
             The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
             distribution volumes for the DEC PHIGS installation
             media, where dd is the device code, c is the controller
             code, and u is the unit number. For example, DKA400 is
             the device name for a CD-ROM.

             You do not have to use the console drive to install
             DEC PHIGS. If you do use the console drive after the
             installation, you should replace any media you removed
             from the drive prior to the installation.

             For CD-ROM media, you must also supply the directory
             location of the DEC PHIGS save set on the CD-ROM. To
             obtain this location, see the Software Product Library
             CD-ROM User's Guide booklet that accompanies the CD-ROM
             distribution kit, or complete the following steps before
             starting the installation:

             1. Determine whether the CD-ROM drive is already mounted
                by entering the command:

                $ SHOW DEVICE DKA400: <Return>

                If the device is mounted, skip to the next step. If
                it is not mounted, type the appropriate MOUNT command
                to mount the CD-ROM, omitting the /FOREIGN qualifier.

             2. Obtain the directory name by entering the command:

                $ DIRECTORY DKA400:[000000]*decphigs*.dir <Return>

                The directory name will be displayed; for example:

                Directory DKA400:[000000]

                DECPHIGS031.DIR;1          (development kit)

                DECPHIGSRTO031.DIR;1       (run-time-only kit)

             3. Obtain the save set name by using a DIRECTORY command
                specifying the directory file from the previous
                command. For example, for the development kit, enter:

                $ DIRECTORY DKA400:[DECPHIGS031.KIT]*.A <Return>



                                                 Installing DEC PHIGS 2-3

 







                 For the run-time-only kit, enter:

                 $ DIRECTORY DKA400:[DECPHIGSRTO031.KIT]*.A <Return>

                 OPTIONS N
                 An optional parameter that enables you to access the
                 release notes. If you do not include the OPTIONS N
                 parameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about the release
                 notes. You should review the release notes before
                 proceeding with the installation, because they contain
                 additional information about the installation.

                 Note that there are several other options you can select
                 when you invoke VMSINSTAL:

                 o  Auto_answer option (A)

                    This option initially creates a file that contains
                    your answers to VMSINSTALL questions and prompts.
                    You can then use the option (and the answer file) to
                    save time during a reinstallation (typically after
                    upgrading your system).

                 o  Get save set option (G)

                    This option lets you temporarily store product save
                    sets on a magnetic tape or in a disk directory.

                 o  File log option (L)

                    This option logs all activity to the terminal during
                    installation.

                 o  Alternate root option (R)

                    This option lets you install the product to a system
                    root other than that of the current system.

                 If you do not supply the save set and device
                 names, VMSINSTAL prompts you for them later in the
                 installation. VMSINSTAL does not prompt you for any
                 options, however, so be sure to include the desired
                 options on the VMSINSTAL command line. If you specify
                 more than one option, separate the options with commas
                 (for instance, OPTIONS A,N). See the documentation on
                 software installation in the OpenVMS System Management
                 Subkit for detailed information on these options.





    2-4 Installing DEC PHIGS

 







             The following example invokes VMSINSTAL to install DEC
             PHIGS development kit from a CD-ROM and shows the system
             response:

             $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DECPHIGS031 DKA400 OPTIONS N <Return>

                   OpenVMS VAX Software Product Installation Procedure V6.1

             It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
             Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

             If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the
             installation, it notifies you and asks if you want to
             continue the installation. In some instances, you can
             enter YES to continue. To stop the installation process
             and correct the situation, enter NO or press Return.
             Then, correct the problem and restart the installation.

          3. Check the status of your processes.

             VMSINSTAL displays a list of all active processes and
             asks if you want to continue the installation:

             %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
                    DECW$SERVER_0
                    _FTA8:
                    _FTA11:
                    _FTA12:
                       .
                       .
                       .

             * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]? Y <Return>

             You can install DEC PHIGS even if other processes
             are running. If you do not wish to continue the
             installation, press Return. If you wish to continue
             installing DEC PHIGS, enter YES and press Return.

          4. Confirm system backup.

        * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?<Return>

             VMSINSTAL asks if you are satisfied with your system
             backup. You should always back up your system disk
             before performing an installation. If you are satisfied
             with the backup of your system disk, press Return.
             Otherwise, enter NO and press Return to stop the
             installation. After you back up your system disk, you
             can restart the installation.

              5. Mount the media.
       
                 If you omitted the device name on the VMSINSTAL command
                 line, the following prompt appears:

             * Where will the distribution volume be mounted: DKA400: <Return>

                 Enter the name of the distribution media device and
                 directory that contains the DEC PHIGS save sets. For
                 example, if the media is contained on a CD-ROM located
                 on unit DKA400:, and the DEC PHIGS save sets are located
                 in the directory DECPHIGS031.KIT (for the development
                 kit), enter:

                 DKA400:[DECPHIGS031.KIT]

                 Depending on the type of device and whether the device
                 is already mounted, the following may or may not appear:

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on DKA400
                 * Are you ready? Y <Return>

                 If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
                 VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, enter
                 NO in response to the "Are you ready?" question. If you
                 respond YES to indicate that you are ready, VMSINSTAL
                 indicates that the media containing DEC PHIGS has been
                 mounted, and then prompts for the product name and any
                 desired installation options:

                 DEC PHIGS DEVELOPMENT KIT

                 %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, cd_name MOUNTED ON DKA400 (NODE 1)

                  Enter the products to be processed from the first 
                  distribution volume set.
                   * Products: DECPHIGS031 <Return>
                   * Enter installation options you wish to use (none): <Return>

                 The following products will be processed:

             %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

          6. Select a release notes option.

             This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N when
             starting the installation.

             Release Notes Options:

                 1.  Display release notes
                 2.  Print release notes
                 3.  Both 1 and 2
                 4.  None of the above

             * Select option [2]: 1 <Return>

             If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
             notes immediately on the console terminal. You can
             terminate the display at any time by pressing Ctrl/C.

             If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a
             queue name. Either type a queue name or press Return to
             send the file to the default output print device:

             * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

             If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
             notes on the terminal and then prompts you for a queue
             name for the printed version. After you type a queue
             name or press Return to send the file to the default
             output print device, the release notes are copied to:

             o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGS031.RELEASE_NOTES (ASCII format)

             o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGS031_RELEASE_NOTES.PS (PostScript
                format)

                 o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGSJ031.RELEASE_NOTES

                 o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGSJ031_RELEASE_NOTES.PS

                 If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL does not display,
                 print, or copy the release notes. This option is
                 typically used when you wish to terminate the
                 installation.

                 ________________________ Note ________________________
       
                 This version of the release notes file installed by
                 VMSINSTAL is labeled with the current product name and
                 version number. Be sure not to delete release notes
                 for previous versions of DEC PHIGS.
                 ______________________________________________________

                 VMSINSTAL then displays the following promp t:
                 * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: Y <Return>
                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been 
                 moved to SYS$HELP.

                 To continue the installation, enter YES and press
                 Return. Otherwise, press Return. In either case, the
                 release notes are copied to files in the SYS$HELP
                 directory.

                 After the installation, you can enter the following
                 command to review the release notes through the Help
                 facility, for example:

                 $ HELP PHIGS RELEASE_NOTES <Return>

              7. Purge the old DEC PHIGS files.

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this 
                 installation [YES]? <Return>

                 The directories SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB] and SYS$SYSTEM may
                 contain previous versions of DEC PHIGS files. These
                 files are replaced during the installation with new
                 files, but the old files are not automatically purged.
                 Purging is recommended. In response to the purging
                 prompt, press Return to purge the files or type NO to
                 keep them.

                 Appendix A lists the files on the system that are added
                 or modified when you install the DEC PHIGS development
                 kit and the run-time-only kit.

          8. Respond to license registration queries.

             DEC PHIGS supports the VMS License Management Facility
             (LMF). The installation procedure displays license
             information about your product and then asks if you have
             registered and loaded your authorization key for DEC
             PHIGS. The following is an example of this information:

             DEC PHIGS DEVELOPMENT KIT

                Product:       PHIGS
                Producer:      DEC
                Version:       3.1
                Release Date:  27-JAN-1994

             * Does this product have an authorization key registered 
               and loaded? Y <Return>

             * Does this product have an authorization key registered 
               and loaded? Y <Return>

             Your PAK must be registered and loaded for the
             installation to complete successfully. Therefore, if
             your PAK is not registered and loaded, you must answer
             NO to this question, stop the installation, register and
             load your PAK, and then restart the installation.

          9. Install the ACS library containing the PHIGS Ada binding
             (development kit only).

             The DEC PHIGS Ada binding requires 20000 blocks of disk space.

                 installed [YES]? <Return>

                 Press Return if you want to install the PEXlib
                 documentation. Type NO if you do not want to install
                 the PEXlib documentation.

              14.Install the Japanese PHIGS-related files.

                       This kit contains Japanese-related files.
                       They require Japanese OpenVMS.

                 * Do you wish to install Japanese related files [NO]? <Return>

                 If the Japanese version of OpenVMS is installed on your
                 system, you will be asked if you want to install the
                 Japanese components of DEC PHIGS. Press Return if you do
                 not want to install the Japanese files. Type YES if you
                 do want to install these files.

              15.Reboot the system after installing DEC PHIGS.

                 If you are installing DEC PHIGS on a workstation,
                 you should reboot the system and then run 
                 SYS$TEST:PHIGS_IVP.COM to complete the installation.

                 * Do you wish to have the system reboot following the PHIGS

             Press Return if you want the system to reboot. Type NO
             if you do not want to reboot the system.

          16.Read the informational messages.

             At this point, the installation procedure displays a
             number of informational messages that report on the
             progress of the installation; there are no further
             questions. If the installation procedure has been
             successful up to this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new
             or modified files to their target directories, updates
             help files, and updates DCL tables, if necessary. If you
             requested that files be purged, they are purged at this
             time.

             The messages displayed are:

             DEC PHIGS DEVELOPMENT KIT:

                    Installation of DECPHIGSRTO V3.1 completed at hh:mm

                    VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

                 The installation procedure is complete. If the procedure
                 was successful, the DEC PHIGS files were moved to their
                 target directories.

              17.Run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP).

                 After DEC PHIGS is installed, you can run the IVP
                 independently to verify that the software is available
                 on your system. You might also need to run the IVP after
                 a system failure to ensure that users can access DEC
                 PHIGS.

              18.Log out of the privileged account.

                 $ LOGOUT <Return>
                 SYSTEM     logged out at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ss

                 VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process
                 symbol tables during the installation. Therefore, if you
                 are going to continue using the system manager's account
                 and you want to restore these symbols, you should log
                 out and log in again.

        2.2 Error Recovery

              If errors occur during installation, VMSINSTAL displays
              failure messages. If the installation procedure fails, one
              or more of the following messages may also appear:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of DEC PHIGS V3.1 has 
              failed.

              This kit requires OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2

              System disk does not contain enough free blocks to install 
              DECPHIGS

          If the Installation Verification Procedure fails for any
          reason, the following message is displayed:

          DEC PHIGS V3.1 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

          %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for DEC PHIGS V3.1 has failed.

          If you receive this message, and all the previous
          conditions listed are correct, contact your Digital field
          service representative.

          Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
          following conditions exist:

          o  The operating system version is incorrect.

          o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

          o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
             insufficient.

          o  System parameter values for successful installation are
             insufficient.

          o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

          o  The product license has not been registered and loaded.

          If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
          you should take the appropriate action, as described in
          the error message. For descriptions of the error messages,
          see the OpenVMS System Messages and Recovery Procedures
          Reference Manual, your processor-specific installation/

                                               After Installing DEC PHIGS


              The following tasks may be performed after DEC PHIGS
              installation:

              o  Installing DEC PHIGS on a cluster

              o  Editing the system startup file

              o  Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              o  Installing maintenance updates

              o  Determining and reporting problems

        3.1 Installing DEC PHIGS on an OpenVMS VAXcluster Configuration

              If you want to run DEC PHIGS on multiple nodes of a
              VAXcluster configuration, first check to see that you have
              the appropriate software license. Then, follow these steps
              after installing DEC PHIGS:

              1. Issue the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
                 on each node in the cluster on which DEC PHIGS is to be
                 executed. Issue the command as described in the OpenVMS
                 License Management Utility Manual.

              2. Run SYS$STARTUP:PHIGS$STARTUP.COM on each node of the
                 cluster that has a software license.

              Do not purge files during the installation. You can purge
              these files after you have run the DEC PHIGS startup
              command procedure on each node of the cluster.

    3.2 Editing the Startup File

          To enable the automatic startup of DEC PHIGS when
          your system is rebooted, you must include the startup
          procedure PHIGS$STARTUP.COM in the startup file-
          SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM under OpenVMS Version 5.5-2,
          or SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM under OpenVMS Version
          6.1. Because DEC PHIGS cannot be started before the network
          has been started, you must position this new command line
          after the line that invokes the network startup command
          procedure. The following example shows the network startup
          command line followed by the DEC PHIGS startup command
          line:

          $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
               .
               .
               .
          $ @SYS$STARTUP:PHIGS$STARTUP.COM

          If you have a graphics peripheral set (dial box or button
          box) installed on your workstation, add the line:

          $ @SYS$STARTUP:PCM$STARTUP.COM

          When you install DEC PHIGS on a cluster, PHIGS$STARTUP.COM
          is automatically executed for the system node from which
          the installation was performed. You may need to execute
          this file for other nodes in the cluster, however, to have
          the newest DEC PHIGS images installed on those systems.
          This is particularly true if you purged older versions of
          DEC PHIGS during the installation.

    3.3 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

          The installation copies the Installation Verification
          Procedure (IVP) to SYS$SYSTEST. You should run this program
          after you reboot the system to complete the installation of
          DEC PHIGS. The IVP verifies that the installation procedure
          was successfully completed, and ensures the integrity of
          installed files if system problems occur. To run the IVP
          separately, enter the following command:

          $ @SYS$TEST:PHIGS_IVP.COM <Return>








    3-2 After Installing DEC PHIGS

 







              If the IVP runs successfully, it generates the picture
              shown in the hardcopy documentation. If your device produces 
              color output, the image will appear in color.

        3.4 Installing Maintenance Updates

              Digital periodically issues maintenance updates of DEC
              PHIGS, each of which contains an installation kit. You
              should install this kit as described in the documentation
              that accompanies the maintenance update.

              Each time a maintenance update is released, the version
              number changes. For example, if the current version is 3.1,
              the version number of the next maintenance update will be
              3.2.

              Furthermore, each maintenance update includes online
              release notes describing the changes made to DEC PHIGS
              since the previous release. You should read the release
              notes when you first install DEC PHIGS; however, they are
              accessible at any time after the product is installed. For
              information on reading the release notes during the DEC
              PHIGS installation, refer to the installation procedure.
              To read the release notes after DEC PHIGS is installed,
              display or print the files:

              o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGS031.RELEASE_NOTES (ASCII format) or

              o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGS031_RELEASE_NOTES.PS (PostScript
                 format)

              o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGSJ031.RELEASE_NOTES

              o  SYS$HELP:DECPHIGSJ031_RELEASE_NOTES.PS

        3.5 Determining and Reporting Problems

              If you encounter a problem while using DEC PHIGS, report it
              to Digital. Depending on the nature of the problem and the
              type of support you have, you can take one of the following
              actions:

              o  Call Digital if your software contract or warranty
                 agreement entitles you to telephone support.
        
              o  Submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).






                                           After Installing DEC PHIGS 3-3

 







          o  Fill out and submit a Reader's Comments form if the
             problem has to do with the DEC PHIGS documentation.
             There are Reader's Comments forms at the back of each
             printed manual. Use the form from the manual in which
             you found the error. Be sure to include the section and
             page number of the error.

          Review the Software Product Description (SPD) and Warranty
          Addendum for an explanation of warranty. If you encounter a
          problem during the warranty period, report the problem as
          described in this section, or follow alternate instructions
          provided by Digital for reporting SPD nonconformance
          problems.
