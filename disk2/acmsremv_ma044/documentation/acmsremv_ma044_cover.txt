             SYS$HELP:ACMS044A.RELEASE_NOTES

          PCA Usage

          Server procedure debugging or task debugging is not supported
          using the DECset Performance and Coverage Analyzer (PCA) compo-
          nent.

 






          DECdtm Usage

          If ACMS is used in a mixed-network environment, Compaq DECnet
          for OpenVMS (Phase IV) and Compaq DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS, and a
          DECdtm transaction is started within ACMS on a Phase IV system,
          it will fail with the following condition when it attempts to
          add the transaction from the DECnet-Plus system.

             '%SYSTEM-F-NOSUCHNODE, remote node is unknown'

          The workaround for this problem is to redefine the SYS$DECDTM_
          NODE_NAME logical name on the DECnet-Plus system to match its
          Phase IV equivalent.
