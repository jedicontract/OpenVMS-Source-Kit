 INTERCHANGE V3.1                                       SPD 54.72.02

 DESCRIPTION

 The DIGITAL Device Access Software (DAS) for Allen-Bradley INTERCHANGE
 allows both BASEstar Open users and DEComni applications to access data
 table memory and shared data memory on Allen-Bradley PLCs.

 BASEstar Open Data Services provide device independent access to shop
 floor data allowing users to access data on an Allen-Bradley PLC sim-
 ply by getting and putting the value of one or more Device_Data_Points.
 DEComni applications can perform a variety of device access functions
 through the DEComni Application Programming Interface (API).

 Users or applications can use BASEstar Open Data Services or the DE-
 Comni API to:

 o  Send read and write commands to Allen-Bradley devices

 o  Receive unsolicited write commands from Allen-Bradley devices.

 The DIGITAL DAS for Allen-Bradley INTERCHANGE supports the following
 Allen-Bradley PLCs:

 o  Allen-Bradley PLC_5, PLC_3, PLC_2, and SLC_500 families

 o  Allen-Bradley PLC_5_250
