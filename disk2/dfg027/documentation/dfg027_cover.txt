          Dear Disk File Optimizer (DFO) customer:


          DFO for OpenVMS V2.7 runs on OpenVMS VAX versions 6.2, 7.1,
          7.2 and 7.3, and OpenVMS Alpha versions 6.2, 7.1-2, 7.2-1, 7.2-
          2, 7.3 and 7.3-1. DFO no longer qualifies OpenVMS VAX version
          5.5-2.

          Through customer feedback and suggestions, the Disk File Opti-
          mizer software continues to improve.

          The main purpose of DFO V2.7 is to extend the compatibility
          of our product to include the new release of OpenVMS 7.3-1 and
          to update our general DFO audience with current bug fixes. See
          release notes for listing.

          A full documentation set has been included as part of the binary
          kit. PDF format is used as most customer have readers that allow
          them to view this format on line for ease of use.

          Once again, thank you for your purchase of this product.

          Sincerely,
