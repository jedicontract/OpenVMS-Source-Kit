                                              Preparing for Installation



              This chapter describes tasks that you must complete before
              installing DEC Notes.

        1.1 Checking the Distribution Kit

              Your bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report
              (BIL) specify the number and contents of your media.
              Be sure to check the contents of your kit against this
              information. If your kit is damaged or if you find that
              parts of it are missing, call your Digital representative.

              Distribution media must be mounted in numerical order. The
              installation procedure prompts you to mount the volumes.
              For more information on how to mount distribution media,
              refer to your processor-specific installation/operations
              guide, which also details several options to the
              installation procedure.

        1.2 Accessing the Online Release Notes

              DEC Notes provides online release notes. The prompt to
              display or print the release notes during the installation
              appears in step 5 of the installation procedure when you
              invoke VMSINSTAL with the OPTIONS N parameter.

              To obtain the release notes after the installation, type
              or print the file SYS$HELP:NOTES$025.RELEASE_NOTES. Online
              help also directs you to the release notes file. After the
              installation, type the following command:

              $ HELP NOTES RELEASE_NOTES

     Preparing for Installation
     1.3 VAX Installation Procedure Requirements

     1.3 VAX Installation Procedure Requirements

           The VAX installation should take approximately 15
           minutes, depending on the type of media and your system
           configuration. Before installing DEC Notes, you must have
           the following privileges and resources:

           o  SETPRV privilege; or CMKRNL, WORLD, OPER, and SYSPRV
              privileges

           o  A minimum of 6000 blocks of free disk space during
              installation; 4500 blocks are used after installation

           o  A minimum of 400 free global pages plus the size (in
              number of disk blocks) of the file SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              at installation; for most efficient operation, you will
              need a total of 2500 free global pages plus the size of
              SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE after installation

           o  A minimum of 2 free global sections at installation;
              for most efficient operation, you will need a total of
              6 free global sections at installation

           o  OpenVMS Version 5.4 or higher

              ________________________Note ________________________

              You must ensure that your system has the necessary
              global page and global section SYSGEN quotas for the
              installation. Failure to do so could cause the DCL
              tables to be corrupted in some situations.

              _____________________________________________________

           To determine the number of available global pages on your
           system, use the VMS Install Utility. Type the following
           commands:

           $ INSTALL :== $INSTALL/COMMAND_MODE
           $ INSTALL
           INSTALL> LIST/GLOBAL/SUMMARY

                   Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

           ?? Global Sections Used,  ???/??? Global Pages Used/Unused

           INSTALL> EXIT

                                              Preparing for Installation
                             1.3 VAX Installation Procedure Requirements

              When you issue these commands, the system displays a
              summary of the number of global sections used, the number
              of global pages used, and the number of global pages
              unused. To exit from the VMS Install Utility, type the
              EXIT command.

              DEC Notes requires approximately 2500 global pages. If
              there are fewer than 2500 pages available, you can delete
              an existing known image with the VMS Install Utility;
              or you can increase the GBLPAGES system parameter with
              the VMS System Generation Utility (SYSGEN) by editing
              the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and then invoking the
              AUTOGEN command procedure, SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM. For
              example, you can include a line like the following in
              MODPARAMS.DAT:

              ADD_GBLPAGES=4000

              For more information on the AUTOGEN command procedure, re-
              fer to the
              VMS System Management subkit.

              You can determine the number of available global sections
              by invoking SYSGEN as follows:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN> USE CURRENT
              SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS
                 .
                 .
                 .
              SYSGEN> EXIT

              The last number displayed is the maximum number of global
              sections. Compare this number to the number of global
              sections in use displayed by the VMS Install Utility. DEC
              Notes requires, at most, 6 global sections. Therefore,
              if the number of global sections used plus 6 exceeds the
              maximum number of global sections, you should increase the
              number of available global sections before you install
              DEC Notes. To increase the number, you must increase
              the GBLSECTIONS system parameter with SYSGEN by editing
              the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and then invoking the
              SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM procedure. For more information
              on the AUTOGEN command procedure, refer to the VMS System
              Management subkit.

     Preparing for Installation
     1.3 VAX Installation Procedure Requirements

           If the number of global sections used plus 6 is less than
           the maximum number of global sections, you can exit from
           SYSGEN and continue.

     1.4 AXP Installation Procedure Requirements

           The AXP installation should take approximately 15
           minutes, depending on the type of media and your system
           configuration. Before installing DEC Notes, you must have
           the following privileges and resources:

           o  SETPRV privilege; or CMKRNL, WORLD, OPER, and SYSPRV
              privileges

           o  A minimum of 7000 blocks of free disk space during
              installation; 6000 blocks are used after installation

           o  A minimum of 830 free global pages plus the size (in
              number of disk blocks) of the file SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              at installation; for most efficient operation, you will
              need a total of 3500 free global pages plus the size of
              SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE after installation

           o  A minimum of 3 free global sections at installation;
              for most efficient operation, you will need a total of
              7 free global sections after installation

           o  OpenVMS Version 1.0 for AXP or higher

              ________________________Note ________________________

              You must ensure that your system has the necessary
              global page and global section SYSGEN quotas for the
              installation. Failure to do so could cause the DCL
              tables to be corrupted in some situations.

              _____________________________________________________

           To determine the number of available global pages on your
           system, use the VMS Install Utility. Type the following
           commands:

           $ INSTALL :== $INSTALL/COMMAND_MODE
           $ INSTALL

              INSTALL> EXIT

              When you issue these commands, the system displays a
              summary of the number of global sections used, the number
              of global pages used, and the number of global pages
              unused. To exit from the VMS Install Utility, type the
              EXIT command.

              DEC Notes requires approximately 3500 global pages. If
              there are fewer than 3500 pages available, you can delete
              an existing known image with the VMS Install Utility;
              or you can increase the GBLPAGES system parameter with
              the VMS System Generation Utility (SYSGEN) by editing
              the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and then invoking the
              AUTOGEN command procedure, SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM. For
              example, you can include a line like the following in
              MODPARAMS.DAT:

              ADD_GBLPAGES=4000

              For more information on the AUTOGEN command procedure, re-
              fer to the
              VMS System Management subkit.

              You can determine the number of available global sections
              by invoking SYSGEN as follows:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN> USE CURRENT
              SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS
                 .
                 .
                 .
              SYSGEN> EXIT

              The last number displayed is the maximum number of global
              sections. Compare this number to the number of global
              sections in use displayed by the VMS Install Utility. DEC
              Notes requires, at most, 7 global sections. Therefore,
              if the number of global sections used plus 7 exceeds the
              maximum number of global sections, you should increase the
              number of available global sections before you install
              DEC Notes. To increase the number, you must increase
              the GBLSECTIONS system parameter with SYSGEN by editing

           the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and then invoking the
           SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM procedure. For more information
           on the AUTOGEN command procedure, refer to the VMS System
           Management subkit.

           If the number of global sections used plus 7 is less than
           the maximum number of global sections, you can exit from
           SYSGEN and continue.

     1.5 User Account Quotas and Privileges

           To use DEC Notes, each account must have TMPMBX and NETMBX
           privileges and the following minimum requirements:

           o  AST limit (ASTLM): 24 (minimum)

           o  Buffered I/O quota (BIOLM): 18 (minimum)

           o  Buffered I/O byte count quota (BYTLM): 8192 (minimum)

           o  Direct I/O quota (DIOLM): 18 (minimum)

           o  Enqueue quota (ENQLM): 30 (minimum)

           o  Open file limit (FILLM): 20 (minimum)

           o  Paging file quota (PGFLQUOTA): 20,000 pages (minimum)

           o  Subprocess creation quota (PRCLM): 2 (minimum)

           o  Working set size (WSDEF): 512 pages (minimum), 1024
              pages (optimum)

           Use the VMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare the
           current values of these quotas with the requirements for
           DEC Notes. For example, the account used in the following
           example is the SYSTEM account:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
           $ RUN AUTHORIZE
           UAF> SHOW SYSTEM

           To change the values of any user account quotas and
           privileges, use the VMS Authorize Utility's MODIFY
           command. For more information, see the VMS Authorize
           Utility Manual.

                                     1.6 VMS License Management Facility

        1.6 VMS License Management Facility

              This product supports the License Management Facililty
              (LMF) features provided by OpenVMS (Version 5.0 and
              higher), and requires that a Product Authorization Key
              (PAK) be registered.

              The license registration information you need is contained
              in the PAK that is shipped with DEC Notes. The PAK is
              a paper certificate that contains information about the
              license you have to run a particular piece of software.

              During the installation, you are asked if you have reg-
              istered the DEC Notes license and loaded the appropriate
              authorization key. You must register and load your license
              for DEC Notes before you start the installation in order
              to run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and
              use the software.

              To register a license under OpenVMS Version 5.0 or
              higher, first log in to the system manager's account,
              SYSTEM. You then have a choice of two ways to perform the
              registration:

              o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When
                 it prompts you for information, respond with data from
                 your PAK.

              o  Issue the DCL command LICENSE REGISTER with the
                 appropriate qualifiers that correspond to information
                 on the PAK.

              For complete information on the VMSLICENSE.COM procedure
              and on the management features of LMF, see the VMS License
              Management Utility Manual.

              There is only one kit for DEC Notes, but there are six
              licenses:

              o  NOTES

              o  NOTES-USER

              o  NOTES-CLIENT

              o  NOTES-CLIENT-USER

              o  NOTES-LOCAL

     Preparing for Installation
     1.6 VMS License Management Facility

           o  NOTES-SERVER-LANLINK

           The NOTES and NOTES-USER licenses have full functionality.
           The difference is that the NOTES-USER license permits only
           a specified maximum number of users to use DEC Notes at
           any one time; the NOTES license does not set a limit.

           The NOTES-CLIENT and NOTES-CLIENT-USER licenses do not
           have full functionality. The difference is that the NOTES-
           CLIENT-USER license permits only a specified maximum
           number of users to use DEC Notes at any one time. It
           allows users to access only remote conferences; they
           cannot create or access local conferences. The NOTES-
           CLIENT license does not restrict the number of users.

           The NOTES-LOCAL license allows access to local conferences
           only. It provides full functionality but does not allow a
           user to access conferences on remote nodes, and does not
           allow the DEC Notes server to run.

           The NOTES-SERVER-LANLINK license allows the DEC Notes
           server to run on a node, but not the DEC Notes clients.
           Users may access conferences on the licensed node by using
           DEC Notes clients on remote nodes or using Conferencing
           clients on other platforms.

           If a user on a system with a NOTES-CLIENT license attempts
           to perform an operation that is not allowed under the
           NOTES-CLIENT license, the following error message is
           returned:

           Your software license does not allow this operation

           If a user on a system with a NOTES-USER license attempts
           to invoke DEC Notes at a time when the maximum number of
           users are using DEC Notes, the following error message is
           returned:

           $ NOTES
           %LICENSE-F-NOAUTH, DEC NOTES-USER use is not authorized on this node
           -LICENSE-F-EXCEEDED, attempted usage exceeds active license limits
           -LICENSE-I-SYSMGR, please see your system manager

        1.7 Using VMSINSTAL

              After you log in to a privileged account to install DEC
              Notes, set the default directory to SYS$UPDATE: and then
              invoke VMSINSTAL, the command procedure that installs this
              product. An example of this procedure is shown in steps 1
              and 2 of the Installing DEC Notes section.

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
              $ @VMSINSTAL NOTES025 ddn: [OPTIONS N]

              You can also type an asterisk (*) in place of NOTES025.
              If you are installing from magnetic tape, you can use the
              asterisk to save installation time; the asterisk causes
              DEC Notes to be installed with a minimum of tape passes.
              For example:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
              $ @VMSINSTAL * ddn: [OPTIONS N]

              The command parameters are described in the next
              paragraphs. If you do not supply the first two parameters
              (NOTES025 and ddn:), VMSINSTAL prompts you for the product
              and device names. If you wish to be prompted for the
              product and device names and to display or print the
              release notes, type the following:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL "" "" OPTIONS N

              ddn:
              Represents the name of a device where the distribution
              volumes will be mounted, where dd is the device code and n
              is the unit number. It is not necessary to use the console
              drive to install DEC Notes. If you do use the console
              drive, you should replace any media you removed from the
              drive. CSA1: is the device name used in examples in this
              document.

              OPTIONS N
              Is an optional parameter you should provide if you want
              to be prompted to display or print the release notes.
              If you do not include the OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL
              does not prompt you to display or print the release notes.
              VMSINSTAL permits the use of several other options. For
              more information on the other options, see your processor-
              specific installation/operations guide.

     Preparing for Installation
     1.7 Using VMSINSTAL

           When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

           o  Whether you logged in to a privileged account.
              Digital recommends that you install software from the
              system manager's account with your default device and
              directory set to SYS$UPDATE.

           o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
              VMSINSTAL checks for the following quota values:

              -  ASTLM = 24

              -  BIOLM = 18

              -  BYTLM = 18000

              -  DIOLM = 18

              -  ENQLM = 30

              -  FILLM = 20

           VMSINSTAL then checks whether the following conditions
           exist:

           o  Whether DECnet is not up and running

           o  Whether any users are logged in to the system

           If VMSINSTAL detects either of these conditions, you will
           be asked whether you want to continue the installation. If
           you want to continue, type YES. If you want to stop the
           installation, press RETURN.

              This chapter contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Defaults appear in
              brackets throughout the installation procedure.

        2.1 Running the Installation Procedure

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              CTRL/Y. When you press CTRL/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              then returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation procedure after pressing CTRL/Y, you must
              proceed from step 2.

              1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
                 device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

                 Username: SYSTEM
                 Password:
                 $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE

              2. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

                  Beginning installation of NOTES V2.5 at hh:mm

              %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

              To indicate that you want to continue the installation,
              mount volume 1, type YES, and then press RETURN.

           4. Insert the subsequent installation kit volumes, if any.

              %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _CSA1: for reading

              Enter "YES" when ready: YES

              VMSINSTAL prompts you to insert the next volume and
              waits for you to type YES after inserting it. If you
              type NO, VMSINSTAL displays the prompt again. This
              prompt is displayed only if your installation kit
              contains more than one volume.

           5. Select a release notes option.

              This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in
              step 2.

              Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

              Additional Release Notes Options:

                  1. Display release notes
                  2. Print release notes
                  3. Both 1 and 2
                  4. None of the above

              * Select option [2]: 2

              If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. You can terminate the
              display at any time by pressing CTRL/C.

                                  2.1 Running the Installation Procedure

                 If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a
                 queue name. Either type a queue name or press RETURN to
                 send the file to the default output print device.

                 * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: SYS$PRINT

                 If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes on line immediately and then prompts you for a
                 queue name.

                 If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL does not display,
                 print, or copy the release notes; typically this
                 option is selected when the user wants to terminate
                 the installation.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                This version of the release notes file installed by
                VMSINSTAL is labeled with the current product name
                and version number. Take care not to delete release
                notes for previous versions of DEC Notes.

                _____________________________________________________

                 Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

                 * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES
                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been successfully
                     moved to SYS$HELP.

                 If you want to continue the installation, type YES
                 and press RETURN. If you type NO or press RETURN,
                 VMSINSTAL discontinues the installation. In either
                 case, VMSINSTAL moves the release notes to SYS$HELP.

              6. Select installation options, and identify your license.

     Installing DEC Notes
     2.1 Running the Installation Procedure

                  DEC Notes can be installed on any system running
                  OpenVMS VAX V5.4 (or later).
                  This installation will fail if this system is running an
                  older version of OpenVMS.

                  DEC Notes provides both a character-cell and a DECwindows/Motif
                  user interface.  Use of the DECwindows/Motif interface requires
                  that DECwindows/Motif V1.0 (or later) be installed.
                  This installation can continue and the character-cell interface can
                  be used if the required version of DECwindows/Motif is not installed.

                  DEC Notes supports both DECnet and TCP/IP transports.
                  Use of the TCP/IP transport requires prior installation
                  of V2.0 (or later) of DEC TCP/IP Services for VMS.
                  Installation can continue and only the DECnet transport will be
                  used if the required version of DEC TCP/IP Services for VMS is
                  not installed on this system.

                  An appropriate software license is required to run DEC Notes.
                  The license should be installed before attempting to install
                  DEC Notes.  If you have not yet installed a DEC Notes license,
                  you can continue with this installation, but you will be unable
                  to run either DEC Notes or the DEC Notes Installation Verification
                  Procedure until an appropriate license has been installed.

                 ***********************************************************

              * Do you want to continue with this installation [Y]? YES

              If you want to continue the installation at this point,
              type YES and press RETURN. If you type NO or press
              RETURN, VMSINSTAL discontinues the installation.

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? YES

              The directories SYS$HELP, SYS$LIBRARY, SYS$MANAGER, and
              SYS$SYSTEM may contain previous versions of DEC Notes
              files. These files are replaced during the installation
              with new files, but the old files are not automatically
              purged. Purging is recommended. In response to the
              purging prompt, press RETURN to purge the files or type
              NO to keep them.

     Installing DEC Notes
     2.1 Running the Installation Procedure

     The system prompts you to identify which license you have
     purchased.

                Please indicate the level of capability that you want to install:

                 1. Full capability (NOTES or NOTES-USER)
                 2. TeamLinks DEC Notes server (NOTES-SERVER-LANLINK)
                 3. Full capability except no remote user access (NOTES-LOCAL)
                 4. Reduced capability, client-only (NOTES-CLIENT or NOTES-CLIENT-USER)


              * Enter the number of the level of capability to install [1]: 1

              The system then prompts you to confirm that the DEC
              Notes PAK has been registered and loaded.

                      Product:      NOTES or NOTES-USER
                      Producer:     DEC
                      Version:      02.5
                      Release Date: dd-mmm-yyyy

              * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded? YES

              If you have registered and loaded your PAK, type YES.
              Otherwise, type NO, in which case the IVP will not be
              run.

           7. Set up the server account, if applicable.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              Step 7 occurs only if you have purchased a full
              capability license (NOTES or NOTES-USER). If you
              have purchased a NOTES-CLIENT license, skip this
              step and continue with step 8.

              _____________________________________________________

              If you are installing an upgrade of DEC Notes, proceed
              with step 7a. If you are installing DEC Notes for the
              first time, skip step 7a and proceed with step 7b.

                 a. Installing an Upgrade of DEC Notes (NOTES or NOTES-
                    USER License)

                    The following messages are displayed only if you are
                    installing an upgrade of DEC Notes:

                    %NOTES-I-EXISTS, NOTES$SERVER account already exists

                    %NOTES-I-ASSUMEOK, This installation will assume it is properly defined

                      The network object NOTES has been defined.  If you wish
                      to view this, run SYS$SYSTEM:NCP and issue the command
                            NCP> LIST OBJECT NOTES CHAR

                    The following message will be omitted if TCP/IP is
                    not installed.

                      The TCP/IP service NOTES has been defined.  If you wish
                      to view this, run SYS$SYSTEM:UCX and issue the command
                            UCX> SHOW SERVICE/FULL NOTES

                    At this point, you should skip step 7b, and continue
                    with step 8.

                 b. Installing DEC Notes for the First Time (NOTES or
                    NOTES-USER License)

                    If you are installing DEC Notes for the first time,
                    the system displays the following messages and
                    prompts you for a UIC number to assign to the new
                    NOTES$SERVER account. Digital recommends that you
                    use the default UIC [376,377]; if you do not use the
                    default, you must ensure that you use a unique UIC.

     Installing DEC Notes
     2.1 Running the Installation Procedure

                   In order to ensure that the DEC Notes server runs with the proper quotas,
                   this installation procedure will create an account for the server.  This
                   account, NOTES$SERVER, has no special privileges and is set up for only
                   network operation.

                       You must specify a unique UIC for this account in order
                       to ensure proper security of your conferences.

                   You may want to change the password on this account after the
                   installation has completed.  If you do, you must also change the
                   password with NCP SET/DEF OBJECT NOTES commands.

                 The system then prompts you for the name of the
                 device to be used for storing conferences. The
                 device name DUA1: is used here for the purpose of
                 demonstration.

                      DEC Notes conference files are stored in a directory named [NOTES$LIBRARY].
                      You must designate the device on which this directory is to be created.

                      Be sure that the device you specify has plenty of free
                      blocks to permit normal conference file expansion.

              8. Read messages.

                 The DEC Notes installation procedure produces a number
                 of informational messages that report on the progress
                 of the installation. If the installation procedure
                 is successful, the new or modified files are moved to
                 their target directories.

                   No further questions will be asked during this installation.
                   Completion of the installation should take another 5-10 minutes.


                   This installation will add the following files:
                    .
                    .
                    .

                 The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
                 files are updated to include the new versions of
                 the DEC Notes HELP text and the NOTES command line
                 definition.

                     1. SYSTEM STARTUP
                        --------------

                     After the installation has completed, you should execute

                               SYS$STARTUP:NOTES$STARTUP.COM

                     on each system on which this copy of DEC Notes will be run.

                     You should also edit your system startup procedure to run
                     SYS$STARTUP:NOTES$STARTUP.COM on each system on which this
                     copy of DEC Notes will be run.

                     ** IMPORTANT NOTE: Installation instructions for previous
                     versions of VAX Notes suggested that NOTES$STARTUP.COM be
                     run prior to network startup during the system startup process.
                     It is now recommended that NOTES$STARTUP run AFTER network
                     startup has COMPLETED, particularly if TCP/IP will be used
                     as the network transport for DEC Notes connections.

                   2. DEC NOTES SHUTDOWN OR DEINSTALLATION
                      ------------------------------------

                   A new utility, SYS$MANAGER:NOTES$REMOVE.COM, can be used to
                   deinstall DEC Notes or to prevent new servers from executing.
                   Type:
                             $ @SYS$MANAGER:NOTES$REMOVE

                   for further details.

                   3. VMSCLUSTER ENVIRONMENTS
                      -----------------------

                   If DEC Notes is run in a VMScluster environment with multiple
                   copies of SYS$SYSTEM:NETOBJECT.DAT in use, NCP must be used to
                   define the NOTES DECnet object in each copy of NETOBJECT.DAT.
                   The password used when defining the NOTES object must always
                   match the password for account NOTES$SERVER in the system
                   authorization file.

     Installing DEC Notes
     2.1 Running the Installation Procedure

                If DEC Notes is run in a VMScluster environment with multiple
                copies of SYS$SYSTEM:UCX$SERVICE.DAT in use, it is similarly
                required that UCX be used to define the NOTES service in each
                copy of UCX$SERVICE.DAT.  This can normally be accomplished by
                running NOTES$STARTUP.COM on each system.  NOTES$STARTUP.COM
                will attempt to properly define and enable the NOTES service
                each time it is executed.

     Installing DEC Notes
     2.1 Running the Installation Procedure

              When the product installation procedure is complete,
              you can choose to install more products, or to log
              out (as shown here.) If you removed any media from the
              console drive before beginning the installation, you
              should replace it now.

              Note that VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in
              the process symbol tables during the installation.
              Therefore, if you are going to continue using the
              system manager's account and you want to restore these
              symbols, you should log out and log in again.

                                            Post-Installation Procedures



              This chapter describes tasks that you must complete after
              DEC Notes is installed.

        3.1 Editing the System Startup File

              You must edit the system startup file (SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_
              V5.COM for OpenVMS Version 5.x systems; SYSTARTUP_
              VMS.COM for OpenVMS Version 6.x systems) to invoke
              SYS$STARTUP:NOTES$STARTUP.COM after you start your
              network.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                In previous versions of DEC Notes, you were required
                to edit the system startup file (SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_
                V5.COM for OpenVMS Version 5.x systems; SYSTARTUP_
                VMS.COM for OpenVMS Version 6.x systems) to invoke
                SYS$STARTUP:NOTES$STARTUP.COM before you started
                your network. This has changed for Version 2.5 of
                DEC Notes. Now you must edit the system startup file
                to invoke SYS$STARTUP:NOTES$STARTUP.COM after you
                start your network.

                _____________________________________________________

        3.2 Network Transport Information

              This section describes how Notes selects network
              tranports.

              It is not necessary to have both the DECnet and TCP
              /IP network transports running. If one of the network
              transports is not running, the Notes server will use the
              other transport.

                                        Post-Installation Procedures 3-1

 



     Post-Installation Procedures
     3.2 Network Transport Information

           If you install a new version of one of the supported
           network transports after the Notes server is up and
           running, NOTES$STARTUP.COM must be run again to enable
           the new transport in the Notes server.

     3.2.1 DECnet Information

           A password is defined for the Notes object in the DECnet
           object database. This password must match the password
           assigned to the NOTES$SERVER account in the system
           authorization file (SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT).

           SYS$STARTUP:NOTES$STARTUP.COM attempts to enable
           the Notes object (object 33) in the DECnet database
           (SYS$SYSTEM:NETOBJECT.DAT). If you plan on using DECnet as
           one of your network transports, DECnet configuration and
           startup must complete before NOTES$STARTUP is run.

           If DECnet is not running when NOTES$SERVER.COM is invoked,
           the Notes server will not be able to accept DECnet
           connections.

           If the Notes object is successfully enabled, the Notes
           server will be able to accept DECnet connections.

     3.2.2 TCP/IP Information

           NOTES$STARTUP.COM attempts to determine if DEC TCP
           /IP Services for VMS is available. If it is avail-
           able, NOTES$STARTUP.COM attempts to enable the Notes
           service (port 3333) in the TCP/IP Service database
           (SYS$SYSTEM:UCX$SERVICE.DAT).

           If you plan on using TCP/IP as one of your network
           transports, TCP/IP configuration and startup must complete
           before NOTES$STARTUP.COM is run. If TCP/IP is not running
           when NOTES$STARTUP.COM is invoked, the Notes server will
           not be able to accept TCP/IP connections.

           If the Notes service is successfully enabled, the file
           SYS$SYSTEM:NOTES$SERVER.COM is created by DEC TCP/IP
           Services for VMS (if it doesn't already exist), and the
           Notes server will be able to accept TCP/IP connections.

        3.3 Installing DEC Notes on a VAXcluster

              If you want to run DEC Notes on multiple nodes of
              a VAXcluster, first check to see that you have the
              appropriate software license. Then you must log in to
              a privileged account on each of the other nodes in the
              cluster and do the following:

              1. Issue the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license,
                 as described in the VMS License Management Utility
                 Manual.

              2. Type the following commands:

                 $ INSTALL :== $INSTALL/COMMAND_MODE
                 $ INSTALL
                 INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
                 INSTALL> EXIT

              3. If the cluster has a server (that is, one or more nodes
                 have a NOTES or NOTES-USER license), then you must do
                 one of the following:

                 a. If this is the first time that DEC Notes has
                    been installed on this system, type the following
                    commands:

                    $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:NCP
                    NCP> DEF OBJ NOTES NUM 33 FILE NOTES$SERVER.EXE
                    NCP> DEF OBJ NOTES USER NOTES$SERVER PASSWORD <password> PROXY OUT
                    NCP> SET OBJ NOTES ALL
                    NCP> EXIT

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The password used in the <password> field must match
                the password of the NOTES$SERVER account.

                _____________________________________________________

                 b. If this is an upgrade of DEC Notes, stop any
                    previous Notes servers (network processes named
                    NOTES$nnnn_n) so that they will be restarted
                    using the new server code. Use the DCL commands
                    SHOW SYSTEM/NETWORK and STOP/IDENTIFICATION,
                    respectively.

     3.3 Installing DEC Notes on a VAXcluster

           4. Type the following command:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:NOTES$STARTUP.COM

     3.4 Invoking DEC Notes After the Installation

           After performing all the necessary steps in Chapter 2 and
           editing the system startup file, DEC Notes can be invoked
           by all users with the NOTES command.

           The installation procedure modifies the DCL command table
           so that the NOTES command is recognized and processed.
           However, the previous command table is still in effect
           for those users who are currently logged in. All logged-
           in users who want to use the NOTES command must log out
           of the system and log in again, or issue the following
           command:

           $ SET COMMAND/TABLE=SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES

           If this is a system with a NOTES-CLIENT license, you
           can simplify the specification of conferences for the
           users on the system by defining NOTES$LIBRARY to point
           to the system on which Notes conference files will be
           stored. (This must be a system with a NOTES or NOTES-USER
           license).

           If many of your users are computer "novices," they may
           need help setting up their Notebooks. As the system
           manager, you can set up Notebooks for them and include
           one or more entries in their Notebooks. The example that
           follows shows how to do this.

           $ DEFINE /USER NOTES$NOTEBOOK NOTES$LIBRARY:NOTES$NOTEBOOK.NOTE
           $ NOTES
           Notes> ADD ENTRY ABC::DECNOTES !abc::decnotes is used as an example
           Notes> ADD ENTRY your-notefile
           Notes> SET PROFILE /EDITOR=EDT !make EDT keypad the default
           Notes> EXIT

           Then, copy the NOTES$LIBRARY:NOTES$NOTEBOOK.NOTE Notebook
           file to the SYS$LOGIN directory of the novice users.

                                       3.5 Controlling DEC Notes Servers

        3.5 Controlling DEC Notes Servers

              During heavy use, DEC Notes Version 2.5 could use the
              maximum number of server links allowed on your system. To
              prevent this from occurring, you can define system logi-
              cals to limit DEC Notes to a specific number of servers.
              Additionally, you can limit the number of links for each
              server by editing the SYS$STARTUP:NOTES$STARTUP.COM file
              and including one or both of the following logicals with
              the desired number. The numbers 4 and 16 are included as
              examples.

              $ DEFINE /SYSTEM /EXEC NOTES$SERVER_MAX_SERVERS 4 !per system
              $ DEFINE /SYSTEM /EXEC NOTES$SERVER_MAX_LINKS 16  !per server

              On most systems, the default number of servers is
              unlimited. DEC Notes has a default of 16 links for each
              server. You can change these numbers for your system, if
              appropriate. Note that if you include these commands, you
              should reedit the NOTES$STARTUP file each time you upgrade
              DEC Notes.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If you have both DECnet and TCP/IP transports
                enabled, the maximum number of links is the
                combined total of DECnet and TCP/IP connections
                simultaneously open in a single server.

                _____________________________________________________

              If you are installing DEC Notes on a system that did not
              previously run DEC Notes, be aware that defaults for the
              working set extent (WSEXTENT) and the working set quota
              (WSQUOTA) have been set up in the NOTES$SERVER account.
              The default for WSEXTENT is not less than 512 and not more
              than 2048; the default for WSQUOTA is exactly half of the
              WSEXTENT. You can change these defaults by issuing the
              following commands (supply the appropriate number values
              for X and Y for your system):

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE
              UAF> MODIFY NOTES$SERVER /WSEXTENT=X /WSQUOTA=Y
              UAF> EXIT

     3.6 Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

     3.6 Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

           The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is usually
           run at installation. If you want to run the IVP separately
           to ensure the integrity of installed files if system
           problems occur, execute the following command procedure if
           you have a NOTES or a NOTES-USER license:

           $ @SYS$TEST:NOTES$IVP

           If the IVP runs successfully, the informational output
           displayed on the screen is similar to the example in step
           11 of the Installation Procedure. If the IVP fails for any
           reason, the following message is displayed:

           The DEC Notes V2.5 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

           Execute the following command procedure if you have a
           NOTES-CLIENT license:

           $ @SYS$TEST:NOTES$IVP_CLIENT

           If the IVP runs successfully, the informational output
           displayed on the screen is similar to the example in the
           Sample Installation section. If the IVP fails for any
           reason, the following message is displayed:

           The DEC Notes V2.5 Client-only Installation Verification Procedure failed.

           Execute the following command procedure if you have a
           NOTES-LOCAL license:

           $ @SYS$TEST:NOTES$IVP_LOCAL

           If the IVP runs successfully, the informational output
           displayed on the screen is similar to the example in step
           11 of the Installation Procedure. If the IVP fails for any
           reason, the following message is displayed:

           The DEC Notes V2.5 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

        3.7 Error Conditions

              If the installation procedure fails for any reason, a
              message like the following is displayed:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of Notes V2.5 has failed.

              An error during the installation can occur if one or more
              of the following conditions exist:

              o  Operating system version is incorrect

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are insuf-
                 ficient (see the Installation Procedure Requirements
                 section)

              o  Process quotas required by VMSINSTAL are incorrect (see
                 the Using VMSINSTAL section)

              o  The VMS HELP library is currently in use

              o  The product was registered incorrectly or not
                 registered

              For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
              conditions, see the VMS System Messages and Recovery
              Procedures Reference Volume, your processor-specific
              installation/operations guide, or the VMS License
              Management Utility Manual.

              If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
              you should take the appropriate action as described in
              the message. You may need to change a system parameter or
              increase an authorized quota value.

              If the installation fails, you must restart the installa-
              tion procedure from
              step 2. If the installation fails because of an IVP
              failure, contact a Digital field service representative.

        3.8 Maintenance Updates

              Digital may periodically issue maintenance updates of DEC
              Notes. Each update consists of an installation kit. You
              should install this kit as described in this document or
              in any documentation that may accompany the maintenance
              update.

     Post-Installation Procedures
     3.8 Maintenance Updates

           Each time a maintenance update is released, the version
           number changes. For example, if the current version is
           1.0, the version number of the first maintenance update
           will be 1.1. In addition, the maintenance update includes
           new release notes. The release notes describe the changes
           that have been made to DEC Notes since the previous
           release.

           The update release notes are provided on line. You should
           read the release notes when you first install DEC Notes;
           they are also accessible at any time after the product
           is installed. For information on reading the release
           notes at the time that you install DEC Notes, follow
           the installation procedure through step 5. To locate the
           release notes after DEC Notes is installed, display or
           print the file SYS$HELP:NOTES$025.RELEASE_NOTES, or type
           the following:

           $ HELP NOTES RELEASE_NOTES

           If you used a private section file with a previous version
           of DEC Notes, after installing Version 2.5 you will need
           to rebuild your section file to be compatible with Version
           2.5.

     3.9 Determining and Reporting Problems

           If an error occurs while you are using DEC Notes and you
           believe that the error is caused by a problem with DEC
           Notes, take one of the following actions:

           o  If you purchased DEC Notes within the past 90 days and
              you think the problem is caused by a software error,
              you can submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

           o  If you have a Basic or DECsupport Software Agreement,
              you should call your Customer Support Center. With
              these services, you receive telephone support that
              provides high-level advisory and remedial assistance.
              For more information, contact your local Digital
              representative.

           o  If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement, you
              can submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

              This appendix contains a sample installation of DEC
              Notes with the NOTES-CLIENT license. (The installation
              excerpts in the Installing DEC Notes section are from an
              installation with the NOTES license, which is similar to
              an installation with the NOTES-USER license.)

              Note that this is only a sample. Sometimes the installa-
              tion procedure is modified in maintenance updates of this
              product. Because this installation guide is not usually
              revised for maintenance updates, be sure to read the Read
              Before Installing or Using DEC Notes letter before you
              install this product. This letter notes any significant
              changes in the installation that vary from this sample.

                   DEC Notes Installation Procedure
             Copyright © Digital Equipment Corporation. 1993.
                        All Rights Reserved.

         DEC Notes can be installed on any system running
         OpenVMS VAX V5.4 (or later).
         This installation will fail if this system is running an
         older version of OpenVMS.

         DEC Notes provides both a character-cell and a DECwindows/Motif
         user interface.  Use of the DECwindows/Motif interface requires
         that DECwindows/Motif V1.0 (or later) be installed.
         This installation can continue and the character-cell interface can
         be used if the required version of DECwindows/Motif is not installed.

         DEC Notes supports both DECnet and TCP/IP transports.
         Use of the TCP/IP transport requires prior installation
         of V2.0 (or later) of DEC TCP/IP Services for VMS.
         Installation can continue and only the DECnet transport will be
         used if the required version of DEC TCP/IP Services for VMS is
         not installed on this system.

         An appropriate software license is required to run DEC Notes.
         The license should be installed before attempting to install
         DEC Notes.  If you have not yet installed a DEC Notes license,
         you can continue with this installation, but you will be unable
         to run either DEC Notes or the DEC Notes Installation Verification
         Procedure until an appropriate license has been installed.

     * Do you want to continue with this installation [Y]?
     * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?
     * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

       ***********************************************************
       REMINDERS:

       1. SYSTEM STARTUP
          --------------

       After the installation has completed, you should execute

                 SYS$STARTUP:NOTES$STARTUP.COM

       on each system on which this copy of DEC Notes will be run.

       You should also edit your system startup procedure to run
       SYS$STARTUP:NOTES$STARTUP.COM on each system on which this
       copy of DEC Notes will be run.

       ** IMPORTANT NOTE: Installation instructions for previous
       versions of VAX Notes suggested that NOTES$STARTUP.COM be
       run prior to network startup during the system startup process.
       It is now recommended that NOTES$STARTUP run AFTER network
       startup has COMPLETED, particularly if TCP/IP will be used
       as the network transport for DEC Notes connections.

     2. DEC NOTES SHUTDOWN OR DEINSTALLATION

                                                     Sample Installation


        A new utility, SYS$MANAGER:NOTES$REMOVE.COM, can be used to
        deinstall DEC Notes or to prevent new servers from executing.
        Type:
                  $ @SYS$MANAGER:NOTES$REMOVE

        for further details.

        3. VMSCLUSTER ENVIRONMENTS
           -----------------------

          If DEC Notes is run in a VMScluster environment with multiple
          copies of SYS$SYSTEM:NETOBJECT.DAT in use, NCP must be used to
          define the NOTES DECnet object in each copy of NETOBJECT.DAT.
          The password used when defining the NOTES object must always
          match the password for account NOTES$SERVER in the system
          authorization file.

          If DEC Notes is run in a VMScluster environment with multiple
          copies of SYS$SYSTEM:UCX$SERVICE.DAT in use, it is similarly
          required that UCX be used to define the NOTES service in each
          copy of UCX$SERVICE.DAT.  This can normally be accomplished by
          running NOTES$STARTUP.COM on each system.  NOTES$STARTUP.COM
          will attempt to properly define and enable the NOTES service
          each time it is executed.

                                           DEC Notes License Information



              This appendix provides information on DEC Notes licenses.

        B.1 The NOTES-CLIENT-USER License

              The NOTES-CLIENT-USER license is a concurrent client-only
              license that provides client-only capabilities to a fixed
              number of invocations of Notes. See the DEC Notes Software
              Product Description (SPD) for more information.

        B.2 The NOTES-SERVER-LANLINK License

              The NOTES-SERVER-LANLINK license provides server-only
              capabilites. It does not allow Notes to be invoked from
              the command line (that is, no client capability). Because
              it is a personal use license, users must be added to the
              license reserve list before they are permitted to use the
              server. The format of the reserve list is different from
              most other applications however since it includes the
              nodename as well as the username. The default username
              from PATHWORKS Conferencing (SPD 38.65.xx) clients is
              Conferencing-User but can be changed by the user.

        B.2.1 Adding a User to the Reserve List

              To add a user to the reserve list for the NOTES-SERVER-
              LANLINK license, be sure to include their nodename. For
              example, if the user on node MYPC has set a username of
              Johnson, then the command to add that user to the reserve
              list for a PAK with an authorization of XXXX would be:

              $ license modify NOTES-SERVER-LANLINK  -
              _$ /authorization=XXXX/reserve=(MYPC::Johnson)/add

              All personal use licenses require that LMF Version 1.1 be
              installed. LMF Version 1.1 comes with VMS Version 5.5 and
              is separately installable on VMS Version 5.4.
