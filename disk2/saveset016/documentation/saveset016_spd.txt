          PRODUCT NAME:  Save Set Manager for OpenVMS            SPD 62.64.12
                         Version 1.6

          DESCRIPTION

          Compaq Save Set Manager for OpenVMS (SSMgr) is a layered software prod-
          uct that reduces user time spent on save set operations. SSMgr reduces
          operational time spent during OpenVMS BACKUP operations by providing
          an avenue for offline save set validation, copy, and save set merge
          functions.

          The key benefits of Save Set Manager for OpenVMS are:

          o  Reduction of operational time spent on online backup and restore
             without compromising data integrity

          o  Selective manipulation of save set contents and attributes

          o  Transfer of backup save sets between tape drive technologies

          o  Transfer of backup save sets from one tape or disk drive to another
             tape or disk drive while maintaining data integrity features

          o  Reduced down time for a BACKUP/RESTORE operation

          o  Ability to monitor degradation of archived save sets

          o  Wildcard support

          o  Backup journal file creation

          o  Multiple output copies on merge and copy

          SSMgr V1.6 supports all operations on ODS-5 disks on Alpha systems run-
          ning OpenVMS V7.2-1, V7.3 and V7.3-1. This is the basis for support
          of:

                                                                  AE-QDKPN-TE

 



          Save Set Manager for OpenVMS                          SPD 62.64.12
          Version 1.6

          -  Long filenames

          -  Deep rooted directory structure

          -  Characters from ISO-LATIN and UNICODE multinational character sets

          -  "?" as a single character wildcard, in addition to the existing "%"
             single character wildcard

          SSMgr V1.6 is qualified for tapes connected on the Fibre Channel

          -  OpenVMS Version 7.2-2 and 7.3X provides support for Fibre Channel
             (FC) connected tape devices. This is accomplished through the use
             of Modular Data Router (MDR) or Network Storage Router (NSR) con-
             nected to the FC Switch. The routers convert Fibre Channel proto-
             col to SCSI protocol, which the tape device understands. SSM V1.6
             has qualified this feature in OpenVMS as used with MDR or NSR. Please
             refer to OpenVMS SPD(s) for a complete listing of supported tape
             devices and routers
