____________________________________________________________

References to Products

   This manual often refers to Digital products by their abbre-
   viated names:

   o  VAX TDMS software is referred to as TDMS.

   o  VAX Language-Sensitive Editor software is referred to as
      LSE.

   If VAX CDD/Plus software is installed on your system, ref-
   erences in this manual to the "VAX Common Data Dictionary,"
   "Common Data Dictionary," or "CDD" refer to the DMU format
   dictionary.

   CDD/Plus supports dictionary definitions in two distinct
   formats:

   o  DMU format-dictionary definitions that you can create and
      manipulate with the DMU, CDDL, and CDDV utilities, and
      other products that do not support the new features of
      CDD/Plus.

   o  CDO format-dictionary definitions that you can create
      and manipulate with the CDO utility, the CDD/Plus call
      interface, and other supporting products.

   You can create and manipulate definitions that you intend to
   use in your TDMS applications in the DMU format dictionary
   using DMU, CDDL, CDDV, and other products that do not support
   the new features of
   CDD/Plus.

   Your site may have products that support the new features
   of CDD/Plus. If so, you may benefit by using these products
   to create definitions in the CDO format dictionary. These
   definitions can be read by both your TDMS applications and
   the products that support the new features of CDD/Plus.

   For more information on the DMU format dictionary, CDO format
   dictionaries, and CDD/Plus in general, see the VAX CDD/Plus
   User's Guide.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.2  TDMS Software Components

        The TDMS software is available in two types of kits: the
        full development kit and the run-time only kit. Each kit
        consists of base software and Postinstallation Installation
        Verification Procedure (IVP) software.

        The TDMS base software consists of:

         o Program interface (TSSSHR.EXE)

           The TDMS program interface is a shareable image that
           contains the callable routines described in the VAX TDMS
           Request and Programming Manual.

         o System startup procedure (TDMSTRTUP.COM)

           The TDMS startup procedure is a command procedure that
           installs TDMS as a known image.

         o Request Definition Utility (RDU.EXE)

           You use the Request Definition Utility (RDU) to create
           and manage TDMS requests and to build TDMS request library
           files. RDU is available only on the full development kit.
           The VAX TDMS Request and Programming Manual describes RDU
           in detail.

         o Form Definition Utility (FDU.EXE)

           You use the Form Definition Utility (FDU) to create and
           manage TDMS form definitions. FDU is available only on the
           full development kit. The VAX TDMS Forms Manual describes
           FDU in detail.

         o Command procedure that calls EDT as the standard editor
           (TDMSEDIT.COM)

           The TDMSTRTUP command procedure defines the FDU$EDIT and
           RDU$EDIT logicals as TDMSEDIT.COM. TDMSEDIT.COM calls
           EDT as the standard editor for use within FDU and RDU.
           TDMSEDIT.COM is supplied only on the full development kit.

     1-2  Preparing to Install VAX TDMS

 











         o Installation-Time Installation Verification Procedure
           (TDMSIVP.COM)

           You can use the installation-time IVP during the installa-
           tion to verify that FDU.EXE, RDU.EXE, and TSSSHR.EXE are
           correctly installed.

         o DCL-level help (HELPLIB.HLB)

           DCL-level help provides information about synchronous and
           asynchronous calls. It contains information on running the
           postinstallation verification procedure, and it contains
           information on where to find the release notes file. For
           the full development kit, DCL-level help also explains
           invoking FDU and RDU.

         o Sample applications

           The sample applications demonstrate features of TDMS. They
           include three samples:

            _ Employee sample

            _ Personnel sample

            _ Department sample

           The sample applications are available only with the full
           development kit.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.3  Prerequisite Hardware

        To run the postinstallation IVP (Installation Verification
        Procedure), you must have a video terminal. See Chapter 4 for
        more information on the postinstallation IVP.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.4  Prerequisite and Optional Software

        This section discusses the software you must have installed
        on your system before installing VAX TDMS. The section also
        includes information about software that you can use together
        with VAX TDMS. Please refer to the System Software Addendum
        (SSA) for a complete list of compatible products and their
        required version numbers. The SSA is part of the Software
        Product Description (SPD).

        To install TDMS, you must have:

         o A valid VMS operating system configuration with VMS
           Version 5.0 or higher installed on your system.

           Refer to the VAX TDMS Software Product Description (SPD)
           for minimum hardware requirements and related configura-
           tion information.

         o VAX Common Data Dictionary (CDD/Plus) Version 4.1 or
           higher installed on your system.

         o The appropriate device for your distribution media.

        If you want TDMS support for the VAX Language-Sensitive
        Editor (LSE), you must install LSE before you install TDMS.
        TDMS support is available only for LSE Version 2.3 or higher.
        See the VAX Language-Sensitive Editor Installation Guide for
        information on installing that product.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.5  License Registration

        The VMS License Management Facility is available with Version
        5.0 of the VMS operating system. If you are installing VAX
        TDMS on a VMS
        Version 5.0 or higher system, you must register your software
        license through the VMS License Management Facility (LMF) in
        accordance with the license agreement signed by your site.

        The license registration information you need is contained
        in the Product Authorization Key (PAK). The PAK is a paper
        certificate that contains information about your license to
        run a particular piece of software.

        During the installation, you are asked whether you have
        registered the VAX TDMS license and loaded the appropriate
        authorization key. You must register and load your license
        for VAX TDMS before you start the installation in order to
        run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and use the
        software.

        To register a license under VMS Version 5.0, first log in to
        the system manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice
        of two ways to perform the registration:

     1-4  Preparing to Install VAX TDMS

 











         o Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it
           prompts you for information, respond with data from your
           Product Authorization Key (PAK).

         o Issue the LICENSE REGISTER DCL command with the appro-
           priate qualifiers that correspond to information on the
           PAK.

        For complete information on using LMF, see the manual on the
        License Management Utility in the VMS documentation set.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.6  VAXcluster Considerations

        When TDMS is installed on a cluster, files are placed un-
        der the SYS$COMMON root. Files from previous TDMS installa-
        tions exist under SYS$COMMON and SYS$SPECIFIC. The files in
        SYS$SPECIFIC must be deleted before you install TDMS Version
        1.9. Therefore, delete the following files before you invoke
        the installation procedure:

           SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSLIB]TSSSHR.EXE;*
           SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSEXE]FDU.EXE;*
           SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSEXE]RDU.EXE;*

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.7  Installation Procedure Requirements

        This section discusses various requirements for installing
        VAX TDMS.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.7.1  Restrictions

        Inform users of the system to avoid using the CDD and help
        while you install TDMS. You can use the REPLY command to send
        a message to users, for example:

          $ REPLY/ALL "Please avoid using the CDD or help.  Installing TDMS."



                                   Preparing to Install VAX TDMS  1-5

 










     ____________________________________________________________

     1.7.2  Time

        The full development installation procedure takes 30 to 40
        minutes. The run-time only installation procedure takes 10 to
        20 minutes.

        the following command at the DCL prompt:

          $ SET DEF SYS$SYSTEM
          $ RUN DMU

        DMU responds with the DMU> prompt. At the prompt, type:

          DMU> SHOW PROTECTION CDD$TOP

        DMU then displays the privileges for that node. To change the
        privilege for that node, enter the following command at the
        DMU> prompt:

          DMU> SET PROTECTION/EDIT CDD$TOP

        With the cursor in the Grant column of the current access
        control list, type a G to obtain the GLOBAL_DELETE privilege.
        To return to the DMU prompt, press Ctrl/Z. Then enter the
        following commands:

          DMU> SHOW PROTECTION CDD$TOP
          DMU> EXIT

     1.7.4  Disk Space

        Installing VAX TDMS requires a certain amount of free disk
        space during the installation. Once VAX TDMS is installed,
        less storage space is required. Table 1-1 summarizes the
        storage requirements for VAX TDMS.

     1.7.5  System Parameters

        Installing VAX TDMS requires certain system parameter set-
        tings. Table 1-2 lists the minimum required system parameter
        values for the installation. Depending on the kinds of pro-
        grams and applications running at your site, you might need
        higher values for some settings.

        Table 1-2:  Required System Parameter Values
        _____________________________________________________________
        System_Parameter___________Value_____________________________

        [1]The_n_variable_refers_to_the_system_parameter_values_that_

        are currently in use. To install VAX TDMS, you must raise
        those values by the number indicated. (See Section 1.7.5.2.)
        _____________________________________________________________

        The following sections show you how to check system parameter
        values, calculate values for the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS
        system parameters, and change parameter values with the VMS
        AUTOGEN command procedure.

     1-8  Preparing to Install VAX TDMS

 










     ____________________________________________________________

     1.7.5.1  Checking System Parameter Values

        To check the values of your system parameters, enter the
        following command at the DCL prompt to invoke the System
        Generation Utility:

          $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
          SYSGEN>

        At the SYSGEN> prompt, enter the SHOW command to display
        the value of a system parameter. The values displayed should
        equal or exceed the the value of each parameter listed in
        Table 1-2. The following command displays the value for the
        GBLSECTIONS system parameter:

          SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS

        After you finish checking the parameters with the SHOW com-
        mand, you can enter the EXIT command at the SYSGEN> prompt to
        return to DCL level.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.7.5.2  Calculating the Values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS

        To install and run VAX TDMS, you must have sufficient free
        global pages and global sections. You must first find out how
        many free global pages and sections you have on your system.
        Then use AUTOGEN if you need to increase the GBLPAGES and
        GBLSECTIONS system parameters.

        The n shown in Table 1-2 represents the current number of
        unused global pages or global sections available on your
        system. For the installation to process successfully, you
        must raise these values by the amount indicated. To calculate
        how many unused global pages and global sections your system
        has, perform the following steps:

         1. Run the VMS INSTALL Utility using the following DCL com-
           mand:

             $ INSTALL LIST /GLOBAL /SUMMARY

           The Install Utility displays a summary of global pages
           and global sections used by your system, as well as the
           current number of unused global pages. For example:

                                   Preparing to Install VAX TDMS  1-9

 











                              Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

             258 Global Sections Used,  22580/3420 Global Pages Used/Unused

         2. Determine whether the number of unused global pages (3420
           in the example) is equal to or greater than 208. If the
           number of unused pages is less than 208, you need to
           increase the value for GBLPAGES.

         3. Note the amount shown for Global Sections Used (258 in the
           example).

         4. Run the System Generation Utility and use the SHOW command
           to determine how many global sections have been allocated.
           For example:

     $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
     SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS

     Parameter Name          Current   Default   Minimum   Maximum Unit  Dynamic
     --------------          -------   -------   -------   ------- ----  -------
     GBLSECTIONS                 512       250        20      4095 Sections

         5. Subtract the amount shown in the summary (258 in the
           example) from the amount allocated. If the difference
           is less than 5, you need to increase the value of the
           GBLSECTIONS parameter.

        If you are installing VAX TDMS on a VMS Version 5.2 sys-
        tem, you can use the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical
        function to find the number of free global pages and global
        sections. The following example shows how to get this infor-
        mation at your terminal (the default for SYS$OUTPUT):

          $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")
          15848
          $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")
          24

        If the values displayed by the system are greater than the
        values in Table 1-2, you do not need to increase the values
        for these parameters. If the value of free global pages or
        global sections is less than the value in Table 1-2, you must
        increase the system parameter setting.

     1-10  Preparing to Install VAX TDMS

 











        Section 1.7.5.3 describes the procedures for increasing these
        values as well as those of other system parameters. Refer to
        the VMS documentation on system management and operations for
        more information.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.7.5.3  Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN

        You use the AUTOGEN command procedure to change system param-
        eters. AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for parameters
        that are associated with the ones you reset manually. To
        change system parameters with AUTOGEN, edit the following
        file:

          SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

        If you need to change a parameter value that is already in
        the
        MODPARAMS.DAT file, use a text editor to locate the line
        containing that value. Delete the current value associated
        with that parameter and enter the new value.

        To add a new value, add a line to the MODPARAMS.DAT file. Be
        sure to include both the name of the parameter and its value
        in the new line.

        You can also modify incremental parameters in the MODPARAMS.DAT
        file. The following example increases the global page setting
        by 2000:

          ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000

                                     NOTE

            When you set the page file quota, do not use a value
            that exceeds the amount of page file space available
            on the system.

        After you make all your changes, exit from the editor and
        execute the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
        parameters. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

                                  Preparing to Install VAX TDMS  1-11

 











        When you specify REBOOT, AUTOGEN performs an automatic system
        shutdown and then reboots the system. Any users logged on to
        the system are immediately disconnected during the shutdown.
        The automatic reboot puts the new parameter values into
        effect.

        When you reboot a system under VMS Version 5.0, the AUTOGEN
        Utility automatically adjusts some of the SYSGEN parameters
        based on the consumption of resources since the last reboot.
        If you do not want to take advantage of this automatic ad-
        justment, include the /NOFEEDBACK qualifier on the AUTOGEN
        command line.

        For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the documenta-
        tion in the VMS System Management Subkit.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.7.6  Process Account Quotas

        The account you use to install VAX TDMS must have sufficient
        quotas to enable you to perform the installation. Table 1-3
        summarizes the minimum process quotas required for the in-
        stallation account.

        Table 1-3:  Process Quotas for the Installing Account
        _____________________________________________________________
        Account_Quota____Value_______________________________________

        ASTLM            24

        BIOLM            18

        BYTLM            18,000

        DIOLM            18

        ENQLM            100

        FILLM____________20__________________________________________

        User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT. You
        use the VMS Authorize Utility to verify and change user
        account quotas. First set your directory to SYS$SYSTEM and
        then run AUTHORIZE:

     1-12  Preparing to Install VAX TDMS

 











          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
          $ RUN AUTHORIZE
          UAF>

        At the Authorize Utility prompt (UAF>), use the SHOW command
        with an account name to check a particular account. For
        example:

          UAF> SHOW SMITH

        To change a quota, use the MODIFY command at the UAF> prompt.
        MODIFY has the following format:

              MODIFY account-name /quota-name=nnnn

        The following example changes the FILLM quota for the SMITH
        account and then exits from the Authorize Utility:

          UAF> MODIFY SMITH /FILLM=50
          UAF> EXIT

        After you exit from the utility, the VMS system displays
        messages indicating whether or not changes were made. Once
        the changes have been made, you must log out and log in again
        for the new quotas to take effect.

        For more information on modifying account quotas, see the
        description of the Authorize Utility in the documentation
        included in the VMS System Management Subkit.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.7.7  VMSINSTAL Requirements

        When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

         o Whether you have set your default device and directory to
           SYS$UPDATE

         o Whether you are logged in to a privileged account

         o Whether you have adequate quotas for installation

         o Whether DECnet is up and running

         o Whether any users are logged in to the system

        The VMSINSTAL procedure requires that the installation ac-
        count have a minimum of the following quotas:

           ASTLM = 24

                                  Preparing to Install VAX TDMS  1-13

 











           BIOLM = 18
           BYTLM = 18,000
           DIOLM = 18
           ENQLM = 30
           FILLM = 20

        If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
        it notifies you of the problem and asks whether you want to
        continue the installation. In some instances, you can enter
        YES to continue. To stop the installation process and correct
        the situation, enter NO or press Return. Then correct the
        problem and restart the installation.

     ____________________________________________________________

     1.7.8  Backing Up Your System Disk

        At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks whether
        you have backed up your system disk. Digital recommends that
        you do a system disk backup before installing any software on
        top of the operating system.

        Use the backup procedures that have been established at your
        site. For details on performing a system disk backup, see
        the information on the Backup Utility in the documentation
        included in the VMS System Management Subkit.

                                                  Installing VAX TDMS
     ________________________________________________________________


        This chapter describes how to install VAX TDMS. Section 2.2
        contains a step-by-step description of the installation
        procedure.

     ____________________________________________________________

     2.1  General Information

        This section includes information about accessing release
        notes, determining files and logical names added to your
        system, running the Installation Verification Procedure
        (IVP), and aborting the installation.

     ____________________________________________________________

     2.1.1  Accessing the Online Release Notes

        VAX TDMS Version 1.9 provides online release notes only.
        You should review the release notes in case they contain any
        information about changes in the installation procedure.

        You must specify OPTIONS N when you invoke VMSINSTAL if you
        want the installation procedure to give you an opportunity
        to display or print the online release notes. This ques-
        tion comes near the beginning of the installation. (If you
        have already reviewed the release notes, you do not need to
        specify OPTIONS N.)

        Once VAX TDMS has been installed, the release notes are
        located in the following file:

          SYS$HELP:TDMS019.RELEASE_NOTES

                                             Installing VAX TDMS  2-1

 











        Online help also directs you to the release notes file. After
        the installation, you can enter the following command to
        review the release notes through the help system:

          $ HELP TDMS RELEASE_NOTES

                                     NOTE

            With this release of VAX TDMS, hardcopy release notes
            are no longer provided.

     ____________________________________________________________

     2.1.2  Determining the Files and Logical Names Added to the
            System

        The files added, replaced, and/or modified on your system
        when VAX TDMS is installed are listed in Appendix B.

        Table 2-1 lists the logical names VAX TDMS adds to the system
        when it is installed:

     2.1.3  Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

        The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) for VAX TDMS
        verifies the installation. During the installation, you
        are asked whether you want to run the IVP as part of the
        installation. If you respond YES, VMSINSTAL runs the IVP. It
        is recommended that you run the IVP to be sure that VAX TDMS
        is installed correctly.

     2-2  Installing VAX TDMS

 











        After VAX TDMS is installed, you can run the postinstallation
        IVP to verify that the software is working properly. You
        might also want to run the IVP after a system failure to be
        sure that users can access VAX TDMS.

        Chapter 4 explains the postinstallation IVP. You can also
        find the same online instructions in the file SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.TDMS]TDMSIVP.TXT.

     ____________________________________________________________

     2.1.4  Aborting the Installation

        To abort the installation procedure at any time, press Ctrl
        /Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure deletes
        all files it has created up to that point and exits. You can
        then start the installation again.

     ____________________________________________________________

     2.2  The Installation Procedure

        The VAX TDMS installation procedure consists of a series of
        questions and informational messages. The following sections
        explain how to invoke VMSINSTAL and answer the installation
        procedure questions.

     ____________________________________________________________

     2.2.1  Invoking VMSINSTAL

        To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command
        procedure from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM
        account. VMSINSTAL is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. Use the
        following command to set default to the SYS$UPDATE directory:

          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE

        Next, invoke VMSINSTAL using the following syntax:

              @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name OPTIONS
     N

        saveset-name
        The installation name for the component. For VAX TDMS, use
        the following installation name:

              TDMSDEV019

                                             Installing VAX TDMS  2-3

 











        device-name
        The name of the device on which you plan to mount the media.
        For example, MTA0: is the device name for a tape drive. It is
        not necessary to use the console drive for this installation.
        However, if you do use the console drive, you should replace
        any media you removed once the installation is complete.

        OPTIONS N
        An optional parameter that indicates you want to be prompted
        to display or print the release notes. If you do not include
        the OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not prompt you to
        display or print the release notes.

        There are several other options you can select when you
        invoke VMSINSTAL:

         o Auto_answer option (A)-Initially  creates a file that
           contains your answers to VMSINSTAL questions and prompts.
           You can then use the option (and the answer file) to save
           time during a reinstallation (typically after upgrading
           your system).

         o Get save set option (G)-Lets  you store product save sets
           temporarily on a magnetic tape or in a disk directory.

         o File log option (L)-Logs  all activity to the terminal
           during installation.

         o Alternate root option (R)-Lets  you install the product to
           a system root other than that of the running system.

        For detailed information on these options, see the documenta-
        tion in the VMS System Management Subkit. If you specify more
        than one option, separate the options with commas (OPTIONS
        A,N).

        The following example shows the command to invoke VMSINSTAL
        to install the full development VAX TDMS kit from tape drive
        MTA0: and the system response. This example uses the OPTIONS
        N parameter for printing or displaying release notes.

          Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

        If you are installing the run-time only kit, type:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL TDMSRTO019 MTA0: OPTIONS N

        If you are installing TDMS on a system disk other than the
        currently running system disk, type:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL TDMSDEV019 MTAx: OPTIONS R DBA1:[SYS0.]

        If you do not supply the product name or the device name,
        VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information later on in the
        installation procedure. VMSINSTAL does not prompt you for
        any options, so be sure to include OPTIONS N on the VMSINSTAL
        command line to access the release notes during the installa-
        tion.

     2.2.2  Installation Questions

        This section discusses the questions that appear during
        the installation. Appendix A contains a sample installation
        procedure showing how the questions can be answered.

        Each question in the installation is marked with an asterisk
        (*)  at the beginning of the line. Some questions show the
        default response in brackets, for example [YES]. If you want
        to use the default response, press only the Return key.

         1. Confirm DECnet status.

             %VMSINSTAL-W-DECNET, Your DECnet network is up and running.
                .
                .
                .
             * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

           VMSINSTAL notifies you if DECnet is running and displays
           a list of all active processes. It then asks whether you
           want to continue the installation. You should install VAX

                                             Installing VAX TDMS  2-5

 











           TDMS on a standalone system or cluster with DECnet shut
           down. NO is the default response to the question.

           If you are installing on VMS Version 5.2 or higher,
           VMSINSTAL does not check the DECnet status. You can in-
           stall VAX TDMS while DECnet is up and running.

         2. Confirm system backup.

             * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

           VMSINSTAL asks whether you are satisfied with your system
           backup. You should always back up your system disk before
           performing an installation. If you are satisfied with the
           backup of your system disk, press Return. Otherwise, enter
           NO to discontinue the installation. After you back up your
           system disk, you can restart the installation.

         3. Mount the media.

             Please mount the first volume of the set on MTA0:.
             * Are you ready? YES
             %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, VAX TDMS MOUNTED ON _$$MTA0:  (NODE 1)
             The following products will be processed:

     2-6  Installing VAX TDMS

 











           You should now mount the first distribution volume on the
           device you specified when you invoked VMSINSTAL. The de-
           vice name is shown in the prompt. VMSINSTAL then asks you
           whether you are ready to continue with the installation.

           If you respond YES to indicate that you are ready,
           VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing
           VAX TDMS has been mounted on the specified device and that
           the installation has begun.

           If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
           VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, enter NO
           in response to the "Are you ready?" question. To abort the
           installation for other reasons, press Ctrl/Y.

         4. Mount additional media volumes.

             %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _$$MTA0: for reading

             Enter "YES" when ready:

           If your installation kit contains more than one volume,
           VMSINSTAL prompts you to insert the additional volumes
           and then asks you to indicate that you are ready for the
           installation to proceed.

         5. Select a release notes option.

             Release Notes Options:

                 1.  Display release notes
                 2.  Print release notes
                 3.  Both 1 and 2
                 4.  Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
                 5.  Do not display, print or copy release notes

             * Select option [2]:

           If you specified OPTIONS N when you started the installa-
           tion, VMSINSTAL asks a question about release notes. You
           have five options for handling the release notes under VMS
           Versions 5.0 and 5.1. There are only four options under
           VMS Version 5.2 or higher.

           For VMS Versions 5.0 and 5.1, you see the following dis-
           play:

             Release Notes Options:

                 1.  Display release notes
                 2.  Print release notes
                 3.  Both 1 and 2
                 4.  Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
                 5.  Do not display, print or copy release notes

             * Select option [2]:

           For VMS Version 5.2 or higher, you see the following
           display:

             Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

             Additional Release Notes Options:

                 1.  Display release notes
                 2.  Print release notes
                 3.  Both 1 and 2
                 4.  None of the above

             * Select option [2]:

           If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
           notes immediately on the console terminal. You can termi-
           nate the display at any time by pressing Ctrl/C.

           If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for the name
           of the print queue:

             * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

           You can press RETURN to send the file to the default
           output print device or you can enter another queue name.

           If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
           notes immediately on the console terminal and then prompts
           you for a queue name for the printed version.

           Option 4 under VMS Versions 5.0 and 5.1 causes the in-
           stallation to copy the release notes to the system help
           directory. [Even if you do not select the VMS Version 5.0
           or 5.1 option 4, the release notes for VAX TDMS are copied
           to the system help directory.] Under VMS Version 5.2 or

     2-8  Installing VAX TDMS

 











           higher, release notes are always copied to the system help
           directory.

           Select option 4 (VMS Version 5.2 or higher) or option 5
           (VMS
           Version 5.0 or 5.1) if you reviewed the release notes
           and are restarting the installation.

           Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following question:

             * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES
             %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been
                                                successfully moved to SYS$HELP.

           To continue the installation, enter YES. Otherwise, press
           RETURN. In either case, the release notes are copied to a
           file in the SYS$HELP directory:

             SYS$HELP:TDMS019.RELEASE_NOTES

                                      NOTE

               The name of the release notes file installed by
               VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name and
               version number. Do not delete release notes for
               previous versions of VAX TDMS.

           After the installation, you can enter the following com-
           mand to review the release notes through the VMS online
           help system:

             $ HELP TDMS RELEASE_NOTES

         6. Check for LSE.

           If you are installing the full development kit, the pro-
           cedure checks whether LSE is on the system where you are
           installing TDMS. If LSE is on the system, the TDMS support
           for LSE is added. If LSE is not installed, the procedure
           displays a message that indicates LSE is not installed
           and asks whether you want to continue. If you want TDMS
           support for LSE, you must install LSE before you install
           TDMS.

         7. Install sample applications.

             * Do you want to install the TDMS sample applications [NO]?

           If you are installing the full development kit, the pro-
           cedure then asks whether you want to install the sample
           applications.

           If you choose not to install the sample applications at
           this time, they will not be available to you after the
           installation.

         8. Choose the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
           option.

             * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

           The installation procedure now asks whether you want
           to run the Installation Verification Procedure. The IVP

     2-10  Installing VAX TDMS

 











           for VAX TDMS checks to be sure that the installation is
           successful. It is recommended that you run the IVP.

           After TDMS is installed, you can run the IVP independently
           to verify that the software is available on your system.
           You might need to run the IVP after a system failure to
           make sure that users can access TDMS.

           See Chapter 4 for information on the postinstallation
           procedure, which runs a TDMS test application.

         9. Purge files.

             * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

           You have the option to purge files from previous versions
           of VAX TDMS that are superseded by this installation.
           Purging is recommended; however, if you need to keep files
           from the previous version, enter NO in response to the
           question.

         10.Respond to VAX TDMS license registration queries.

             Product:       VAX TDMS
             Producer:      DEC
             Version:       1.9
             Release Date:  DD-MMM-YYYY

             * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

           The installation procedure displays license information
           about your product and then asks whether you have regis-
           tered and loaded your Product Authorization Key (PAK) for
           VAX TDMS.

           If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you must
           answer NO to this question. You have to register and load
           your PAK to successfully complete the installation. If you
           have not done so, you should stop the installation, regis-
           ter and load your PAK, and then restart the installation.

     ____________________________________________________________

     2.2.3  Informational Messages

        At this point, the installation procedure displays a number
        of informational messages that report on the progress of
        the installation. There are no further questions. If the
        installation procedure has been successful up to this point,
        VMSINSTAL moves the new or modified files to their target
        directories, updates help files, and updates DCL tables, if
        necessary. If you asked for files to be purged, that work is
        done now. The following message is displayed to indicate that
        the installation is nearly complete:

     %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target directories...

     ____________________________________________________________

     2.3  Error Recovery

        If errors occur during the installation itself or when the
        IVP is running, VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the
        installation fails, you see the following message:

          %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of VAX TDMS V1.9 has failed.

        If the IVP fails, you see these messages:

          The VAX TDMS V1.9 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

          %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for VAX TDMS V1.9 has failed.

        Errors can occur during the installation if any of the fol-
        lowing conditions exist:

         o The operating system version is incorrect.

         o A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

         o Quotas necessary for successful installation are insuffi-
           cient.

         o System parameter values for successful installation are
           insufficient.

         o The VMS help library is currently in use.

         o The TDMS or CDD/Plus license has not been registered and
           loaded.

        For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
        conditions, see the VMS documentation on system messages,
        recovery procedures, and VMS software installation. If you
        are notified that any of these conditions exist, you should
        take the appropriate action as described in the message.
        (You might need to change a system parameter or increase
        an authorized quota value.) For information on installation
        requirements, see Chapter 1.

                                            After Installing VAX TDMS
     ________________________________________________________________


        After installing VAX TDMS, you need to perform the following
        tasks:

         o Edit the system startup and shutdown files.

         o Set user account quotas.

         o Make VAX TDMS available on each licensed node in
           your VAXcluster (if you are installing VAX TDMS on a
           VAXcluster).

         o Create the CDD tree (full development option).

         o Remove nonessential files.

        This chapter explains how to perform these tasks.

     ____________________________________________________________

     3.1  Editing the System Files

        You must edit the system startup file to provide for auto-
        matic startup of VAX TDMS when your system is rebooted.

        Add the command line that starts VAX TDMS to the system
        startup file, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM. VAX TDMS cannot
        start until after the network has started. You must position
        this new command line after the line that invokes the network
        startup command procedure. The following example shows the
        network startup command line followed by the startup command
        line for VAX TDMS:

                                       After Installing VAX TDMS  3-1

 











          $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
               .
               .
               .
          $ @SYS$MANAGER:TDMSSTRTUP.COM

     ____________________________________________________________

     3.2  User Account Requirements

        To use VAX TDMS, user accounts on your system must have at
        least the TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges. Use the VMS Authorize
        Utility to determine whether users have the privileges they
        require.

        The user accounts must also have sufficient quotas to be able
        to use VAX TDMS. Table 3-1 summarizes the minimum required
        user account quotas.

        Table 3-1:  User Account Quotas for Using VAX TDMS
        _____________________________________________________________
        Account_Quota____Value_______________________________________

        ASTLM            24

        BIOLM            18

        BYTLM            18,000

        DIOLM            18

        ENQLM            100

        FILLM____________20__________________________________________

        User account privileges and quotas are stored in the file
        SYSUAF.DAT. You use the VMS Authorize Utility to verify
        and change user account privileges and quotas. To use the
        Authorize Utility, set your directory to SYS$SYSTEM and use
        the DCL RUN command as follows:

          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
          $ RUN AUTHORIZE
          UAF>

     3-2  After Installing VAX TDMS

 











        At the Authorize Utility prompt (UAF>), enter the SHOW com-
        mand with an account name to check that particular account.
        For example:

          UAF> SHOW SMITH

        To change a quota, use the MODIFY command at the UAF> prompt.
        MODIFY has the following format:

              MODIFY account-name /quota-name=nnnn

        The following example adds the NETMBX privilege, changes the
        FILLM quota for the SMITH account and then exits from the
        utility:

          UAF> MODIFY SMITH /PRIVILEGES=NETMBX /FILLM=50
          UAF> EXIT

        After you exit from the utility, the VMS system displays
        messages indicating whether changes were made. Once you have
        finished making the changes, the users must log out and log
        in again for the new quotas to take effect.

        For more information on modifying account quotas, see the
        description of the Authorize Utility in the VMS documentation
        set.

     ____________________________________________________________

     3.3  VAXcluster Considerations

        After you install VAX TDMS on a VAXcluster, you must do the
        following tasks on each licensed node in the VAXcluster:

         o Register the license for VAX TDMS

         o Execute the VAX TDMS startup command procedure

         o Install DCLTABLES.EXE

         o Run the IVP and the postinstallation IVP

     3.4  Creating the CDD/Plus Tree for the Sample Applications

        The sample applications are an optional part of the full
        development kit. If you chose to install the sample appli-
        cations, TDMS links them to produce executable images that
        you can later run. However, the installation procedure does
        not create the CDD/Plus tree containing the sample records,
        forms, requests, and request library definitions.

        To create the CDD/Plus tree containing the sample records,
        forms, requests, and request library definitions, type the
        following:

          $ SET DEFAULT TDMS$EXAMPLES
          $ @TDMSBLDSAMPLE

        This command procedure creates the CDD/Plus tree in the
        CDD$TOP.TDMS$SAMPLES directory. It also builds the sample
        request library files.

        See the VAX TDMS Forms Manual for information on running the
        sample applications.

     ____________________________________________________________

     3.5  Removing Nonessential Files

        If you have limited disk space, you can remove some files
        that are installed on your system as part of the TDMS instal-
        lation procedure:

         o Sample application files (full development option)

           The files associated with the sample applications exist in
           TDMS$EXAMPLES. If you installed these files and now want
           to remove them, (approximately 2600 blocks), type:

             $ DELETE/LOG TDMS$EXAMPLES:*.*;*

         o Postinstallation IVP files (both options)

     3-4  After Installing VAX TDMS

 











           To delete the TDMS postinstallation IVP files (approxi-
           mately 222 blocks in the full development option and 151
           in the run-time only option), type:

             $ DELETE/LOG SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST]TDMS*.COM;*
             $ DELETE/LOG SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.TDMS]*.*;*

                                      NOTE

               The postinstallation IVP files remain on the system
               so that you can run the postinstallation IVP at
               any time after installing TDMS. Do not delete these
               files if you plan to run the postinstallation IVP.

        If you ran the installation-time IVP as part of the instal-
        lation, all installation-time IVP files created during the
        installation procedure are automatically deleted after the
        IVP is completed.

     3.6  Determining and Reporting Problems

        If you encounter a problem while using VAX TDMS, report it
        to Digital. Depending on the nature of the problem and the
        type of support you have, you can take one of the following
        actions:

         o Call Digital if your software contract or warranty agree-
           ment entitles you to telephone support.

         o Submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

         o Fill out and submit a Reader's Comments form if the prob-
           lem has to do with the VAX TDMS documentation. There are
           Reader's Comments forms at the back of each manual. Use
           the form from the manual in which you found the error.
           Include the section and page number.

        Review the Software Product Description (SPD) and Warranty
        Addendum for an explanation of warranty. If you encounter
        a problem during the warranty period, report the problem as
        indicated above or follow alternate instructions provided by
        Digital for reporting SPD nonconformance problems.

        See the release notes for VAX TDMS for information on how to
        submit an SPR.

                                                            Chapter 4


                              Postinstallation Verification Procedure
     ________________________________________________________________


        This chapter describes the postinstallation IVP. This IVP
        checks that the full development and run-time only installa-
        tion procedures correctly installed TDMS. This IVP also runs
        a TDMS test application. In addition, the full development
        kit postinstallation IVP makes sure the software works with
        the VAX Common Data Dictionary (CDD) and builds a TDMS appli-
        cation. The IVP for both kits is based on the Employee sample
        application.

                                     NOTE

            The postinstallation IVP must be installed on the
            currently running system disk to operate correctly. If
            you installed TDMS on a system disk that you are not
            currently using, you must boot your system from that
            disk before you run the postinstallation IVP.

        If errors occur during the postinstallation IVP, run the
        postinstallation IVP again. If the problem still occurs,
        submit a Software Performance Report (if you are eligible to
        do so).

        The postinstallation IVP is divided into two phases. During
        the first phase of the postinstallation IVP, the following
        occurs:

         o If the full development kit is being installed, the
           postinstallation IVP verifies the installation of the
           TDMS utilities and invokes a command procedure that:

            _ Inserts the IVP forms, record definitions, requests,

              and request library in the CDD

                         Postinstallation Verification Procedure  4-1

 











            _ Builds the IVP request library file (.RLB)

            _ Links the IVP program

         o If the run-time only kit is being installed, the postin-
           stallation IVP links the IVP program.

        The second phase of the postinstallation IVP runs a program
        that uses TDMS calls with a request library file and verifies
        the operation of the program. This program is the same for
        the full development and run-time only kits.

     ____________________________________________________________

     4.1  Phase 1 of the Postinstallation IVP

        To run Phase 1 of the postinstallation IVP, follow these
        steps:

         1. Log in to a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM ac-
           count.

         2. Set your default directory to the system test directory,
           as follows:

             $ SET DEFAULT SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST]

         3. Invoke the command procedure for the kit you are in-
           stalling.

            o If you are installing the full development kit, type:

                $ @TDMSBLDIVP

              The TDMSBLDIVP.COM command procedure checks that TDMS
              works with the VMS operating systems and the CDD. It
              also creates the forms, records, requests, and request
              libraries needed for the IVP. It builds the IVP request
              library file and links the IVP program against the TDMS
              program interface.

            o If you are installing the run-time only kit, type:

                $ @TDMSRTOIVP

              The TDMSRTOIVP.COM command procedure links the IVP
              program against the TDMS program interface.

     4-2  Postinstallation Verification Procedure

 











         4. Answer the following question:

             Have you invoked the VAX TDMS system startup procedure [Y/N]?

           The TDMS system startup procedure installs TDMS as a
           known image. The TDMS installation procedure invokes
           the TDMS system startup procedure, TDMSTRTUP.COM, during
           the installation. Therefore, you would normally answer
           YES to this question. However, some situations may cause
           your system to be running without knowing that TDMS is
           installed. For example, if you chose not to modify your
           system startup command file to invoke the TDMS system
           startup procedure, the TDMS procedure is not performed
           when you boot your system. Therefore, if you boot your
           system, TDMS is no longer installed as a known image.
           In this case, you would answer NO to this question. The
           IVP command procedure would then invoke the TDMS system
           startup procedure.

        See Appendix A for sample Phase 1 postinstallation IVP ses-
        sions.

     ____________________________________________________________

     4.2  Phase 2 of the Postinstallation IVP

        The procedure you follow for Phase 2 of the TDMS postinstal-
        lation IVP is the same for the full development and run-time
        only kits. During Phase 2, you run the postinstallation IVP
        program that calls TDMS to display forms and accept input.
        You must perform Phase 1 of the IVP before you run Phase 2.

        Because TDMS applications run only on video terminals, you
        must run Phase 2 of the postinstallation IVP program on
        a VT100-, VT200-, or VT300-series terminal. You may also
        use terminals that are VT100-compatible. See the VAX TDMS
        Software Product Description for a complete list of the
        supported terminals.

        During Phase 2 of the postinstallation IVP, you are asked
        to input data to forms. To allow you to input this data, the
        postinstallation IVP has defined function keys that allow
        you to move around forms, signal that input is complete,
        and get help. Table 4-1 shows what keys are defined for the
        postinstallation IVP application.

        (F13)________________________________________________________

                                     NOTE

            If the test does not run exactly as detailed here (for
            example, if the cursor does not tab correctly or the
            wrong form is displayed), run the postinstallation
            IVP again. If the problem still occurs, submit an
            SPR explaining which step failed and what message the
            postinstallation IVP displayed at the time.

        The following list describes how the postinstallation IVP
        program proceeds and what you should type to complete the
        test. Each numbered item names the form displayed at each
        step. To start the postinstallation IVP program, type:

          $ SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE
          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.TDMS]
          $ RUN TDMSIVP

         1. IVP Initial form

           The IVP begins with an Initial form that introduces you
           to the TDMS IVP. The Initial form appears as shown in
           Figure 4-1.

                                       Files Installed on Your System
     ________________________________________________________________


        During installation, several files are copied to your system.
        The installation procedure generates a file that contains
        the specifications for the copied files. The specification of
        that file is as follows:

        SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]TDMS019_FILES.DAT

        The files that are added to the system or modified but are
        not listed in that file are listed in the sections that
        follow.

     ____________________________________________________________

     B.1  Release Notes File

        The release notes file for TDMS has the following specifica-
        tion:

        SYS$HELP:TDMS019.RELEASE_NOTES

     ____________________________________________________________

     B.2  Updated System Files

        The TDMS installation updates the following VMS system files
        for the full development and run-time only kits:

         o SYS$LIBRARY:IMAGELIB.OLB

           IMAGELIB.OLB is the system-wide shareable image sym-
           bol table library that the VAX Linker uses to resolve
           external references to symbols defined in shareable
           images. The TDMS program interface shareable image
           (SYS$LIBRARY:TSSSHR.EXE) is inserted into this library.

           When you link programs that use TDMS calls, the Linker
           automatically resolves the TDMS symbols you use.
