 Dear Compaq Data Cartridge Server Component customer:

 Thank you for your recent purchase of Data Cartridge Server Com-
 ponent (DCSC) Version 3.2 software. DCSC is capable of operating
 in a mixed OpenVMS cluster environment. The kit you have just re-
 ceived includes both the OpenVMS VAX[TM] and OpenVMS Alpha[TM]
 versions of DCSC V3.2.

 DCSC was previously named Digital Cartridge Server Component.

 The DCSC documentation set, i.e. Installation Guide, System Man-
 ager's Guide, User's Guide, and Programmer's Reference Guide, is
 unchanged since the release of DCSC V3.0.

 DCSC is Year 2000 Compliant.

 DCSC V3.2 is supported on OpenVMS VAX[TM] V5.5-2, V6.2, V7.1, and
 V7.2 and on OpenVMS Alpha[TM] V6.2, V7.1, V7.2 and 7.2-1.

 Through customer feedback and continuous improvements, the DCSC
 software gets better all the time. DCSC V3.2 has the following
 changes over Version 3.1 (3.1F):

 o  Support for OpenVMS 7.2 and 7.2-1

 o  Support for EV6 processor

 o  Support for up to 20 tape drives per panel

 o  Bug fixes since the last release

 Please refer to the release notes for more details.

 DCSC V3.2 will be the last version that supports OpenVMS V5.5-
 2. DCSC V3.2 will not be supplied on either 9-track tape or TK50
 tape. If this causes you concern please send email to the product
 manager.

 Once again, thank you for your purchase of this product.

 Sincerely,

 Bryan Cox
