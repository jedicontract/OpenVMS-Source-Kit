    Conventions

          The following conventions are used in this manual:

          Ctrl/x           A sequence such as Ctrl/x indicates that
                           you must press and hold the key labeled
                           Ctrl while you press another key or a
                           pointing device button.

          <Return>         In examples, a key name enclosed in a
                           box indicates that you press a key on
                           the keyboard. (In text, a key name is not
                           enclosed in a box.)

                well and, as you read the information, you can use the
                product name Oracle Trace instead of the product name
                DECtrace with no significant difference in meaning.

              This chapter describes the available ACMS kits. It also
              discusses the dependencies among ACMS Version 4.4, the
              OpenVMS operating system, and other layered products, and
              considerations for upgrading and using these products in a
              distributed environment.

              The Part List, found in the transparent plastic envelope
              in your kit, specifies the number and contents of your
              media. Be sure to verify the contents of your kit with
              this information. If your kit is damaged or if you
              find that parts of it are missing, contact your Compaq
              representative.

        1.1 Types of ACMS Kits

              ACMS is available in three different kits:

              o  ACMS Development Kit

                 This kit provides all the features of ACMS. You can
                 define, build, and debug multiple-step tasks, task
                 groups, menus and applications, as well as use the ACMS
                 task queuing facilities. You can use DECforms or TDMS
                 as standard presentation services, or use the Request
                 Interface (RI) and Systems Interface (SI) to access
                 other presentation services. You are provided with
                 samples of ACMS applications using standard presentation
                 services and the Request Interface.

                 The development kit also includes the features provided
                 by the run-time and remote-access kits.

              o  ACMS Run-Time Kit

                 This kit allows you to use existing applications or
                 programs under the control of ACMS. It also allows
                 you to define and debug menus, applications, task
                 groups, and single-step tasks that use DCL servers,

    1.1 Types of ACMS Kits


             if Oracle CDD is present when this kit is installed. It
             allows ACMS users to sign in and select tasks that are
             implemented on the local node as well as remote nodes.
             The run-time kit allows you to use the ACMS Queued Task
             Initiator (QTI) to submit tasks to run on the local node
             as well as remote nodes.

             The run-time kit also includes the features provided by
             the remote-access kit.

          o  ACMS Remote-Access Kit

             This kit is suitable for installation on a network node
             that does not have any ACMS applications running on
             it, but requires access to ACMS applications running on
             another network node. The remote-access kit allows users
             to sign in to ACMS and select tasks on remote nodes, and
             handles the terminal I/O associated with those tasks.
             The remote access kit allows you to use the ACMS QTI to
             submit tasks to run on remote nodes.

    1.2 ACMS Licenses

          Each ACMS kit has an unlimited-use ACMS license associated
          with it. Table 1-1 shows the licenses that are applicable
          to each ACMS kit.

          For more information about these ACMS licenses, refer to
          Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS Managing Applications.

          To install an ACMS Version 4.4 kit, you must register and
          load an ACMS software license, using the OpenVMS License
          Management Facility (LMF). You must register and load your
          ACMS license before you perform the installation.

          For more information on registering and loading your ACMS
          license, refer to Appendix B.

        1.3 Required Operating System Components

              Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS Alpha Version 4.4 requires OpenVMS
              Alpha Version 6.2,  7.2-1, or 7.3.

              Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS VAX Version 4.4 requires OpenVMS
              VAX Version 6.2,  7.2, or 7.3.

              For distributed processing with ACMS, you must have DECnet
              software installed.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you install ACMS Version 4.4 on an Alpha system
                running a version of OpenVMS Alpha lower than OpenVMS
                Alpha Version 7.x, you must reinstall ACMS Version 4.4
                after you upgrade to OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.x.

                ______________________________________________________

        1.4 Layered Product Requirements

              The ACMS Version 4.4 installation procedure and IVP
              interact with a number of OpenVMS layered products. Some
              of these products are required, while others are optional.

              Each of these layered products has a minimum version (based
              on the OpenVMS version) that is supported with ACMS Version
              4.4. The ACMS Version 4.4 Software Product Description
              (SPD) identifies the minimum layered product versions
              required to successfully install ACMS Version 4.4 and run
              the IVP.

              If a product is required, you must make the minimum version
              available before you can install ACMS. If a product is
              not required, you do not need to make it available before
              installing ACMS, however, you must upgrade it to the
              minimum required version before using it with ACMS.

        1.4.1 Determining Software Version Numbers

              Before installing ACMS Version 4.4, identify the other
              products that you need to upgrade. The ACMS SPD contains a
              complete list of the products that are compatible with this
              version of ACMS, including information about the minimum
              version of OpenVMS and layered products that interact with
              ACMS Version 4.4.

        1.4.2 Requirements for Oracle CDD

              Oracle CDD/Repository Version 7.0 is supported by ACMS
              Version 4.4.

              The following paragraphs discuss the requirements for
              Oracle CDD when installing the different ACMS kit types.

              If you are installing the ACMS development kit, at least
              the minimum version of CDD as identified in the ACMS SPD
              must be installed on your system. If CDD is not installed
              or if a lower version of CDD is installed, VMSINSTAL
              terminates the installation procedure.

              If you are installing the ACMS run-time kit, CDD is
              optional; however, the minimum version of CDD is required
              for the run-time kit to be fully functional. Specifically,
              if you install the ACMS run-time kit with CDD available,
              you can create new applications and menus and modify
              existing applications and menus, on your ACMS run-time
              system. If you install the ACMS run-time kit without CDD
              available, you can use only existing applications and
              menus; you cannot create new ones on your run-time system.
              If you subsequently install CDD, you can make the ACMS run-
              time CDD-related features available by reinstalling the
              ACMS Version 4.4 run-time kit and choosing the CDD-related
              files option at the beginning of the installation.

              If you are installing the ACMS remote-access kit, CDD is
              not required.

    1.4 Layered Product Requirements


    1.4.3 Requirements for LSE

          LSE is an optional layered product for all ACMS kits. If
          the minimum version (or a higher, allowed version) of LSE
          as identified in the ACMS SPD is not available when you
          install ACMS, LSE templates for ACMS Version 4.4 are not
          provided on your system. If you subsequently install LSE,
          you can make the ACMS Version 4.4 LSE templates available
          by reinstalling the ACMS Version 4.4 kit and choosing the
          LSE update option at the beginning of the installation.

    1.4.4 Requirements for TP Desktop Connector

          Compaq TP Desktop Connector for OpenVMS is an optional
          layered product for ACMS. If you are installing TP Desktop
          Connector on a system with ACMS Version 4.0 or higher, you
          must have at least the minimum version of the TP Desktop
          Connector as identified in the ACMS SPD.

          If the ACMS installation runs while TP Desktop Connector is
          running, the results are unpredictable. Use the following
          command to shut down TP Desktop Connector before you begin
          an installation of ACMS:

          $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSDI$SHUTDOWN.COM

    1.4.5 Recommended Order for Installing Software

          To ensure problem-free installation of software on your
          system, install the OpenVMS operating system and layered
          products in the following order:

          1. OpenVMS

          2. LSE

          3. Oracle Rdb

          4. Oracle Trace

          5. Oracle CDD

          6. Oracle CODASYL DBMS

          7. TDMS (VAX only)

          8. DECforms

          9. ACMS

         10. TP Desktop Connector

                           1.5 Upgrading Software in a Distributed System


        1.5 Upgrading Software in a Distributed System

              Upgrading software in a distributed transaction processing
              system is complex because of the dependencies among the
              software products. The process becomes even more complex
              when you take into account the dependencies that are
              created from multiple versions that exist for each of the
              individual software products.

              Because you cannot upgrade all nodes in a distributed
              environment simultaneously, and because the upgrade process
              might last several days, a clear methodology is required
              to ensure smooth and timely introduction of new software
              versions.

        1.5.1 Configuration Issues

              A simple, distributed configuration in a TP system consists
              of an ACMS front-end node and an ACMS back-end node. You
              can configure ACMS on each node for the processing of
              specific tasks. Likewise, the roles of the layered products
              on each node are distinct. For simple configurations, the
              upgrade process is straightforward:

              1. Upgrade the software on the front-end nodes.

              2. Upgrade the software on the back-end nodes.

              Upgrading in this order ensures that the system delivers
              the same version of software to the front-end node and the
              back-end node.

              However, this simple rule cannot be applied to a
              configuration in which a node is both a front end and
              a back end. To successfully upgrade a more complex
              configuration, apply these two key points:

              o  A component built by a previous software version is
                 compatible with the upgraded version of the software.

                 For example, DECforms Version 1.4 can execute a
                 form created by DECforms Version 1.3, without any
                 modification. You can also copy this component from a
                 node on which DECforms Version 1.3 is installed to a
                 node with DECforms Version 1.4. The DECforms Version 1.3
                 form executes correctly, as long as you do not rebuild
                 the form using Version 1.4.

    Planning the ACMS Installation
    1.5 Upgrading Software in a Distributed System


          o  Do not rebuild a component under the new software
             version until you upgrade all nodes to which it may
             possibly be shipped.

          To upgrade software in a distributed system, follow these
          steps:

          1. Upgrade all software on the front-end-only nodes.

          2. Upgrade all software on nodes that are both front-end
             and back-end nodes.

          3. Upgrade all software on back-end-only nodes.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Do not modify by recompilation any application
             components (unless required by the installation
             procedure) until you upgrade all the nodes that
             compose the distributed application.

             ______________________________________________________

    1.6 Product Dependencies

          Keep in mind the following dependencies when upgrading
          software, especially in a distributed environment:

          o  ACMS

             ACMS copies DECforms forms (.FORM) and shareable images
             (.EXE), TDMS request library files (.RLB), and ACMS
             application database files (.ADB) from back-end to
             front-end nodes, if the versions or dates of the files
             on the back end are more recent.

          o  Oracle CDD

             CDD versions are interoperable in a distributed
             environment as long as features of the new version
             are not requested when using the previous version.
             CDD is not referenced in the run-time system by the
             layered products (except possibly by Rdb and DBMS,
             although this is not advised) except in the case of
             module recompilation. However, do not recompile or add
             features until the upgrade is complete.

          o  DECforms

             See the DECforms SPD for DECforms dependencies.

              o  OpenVMS Alpha operating system

                 When upgrading major versions of the OpenVMS Alpha
                 operating system, you must reinstall ACMS. This applies
                 when upgrading the OpenVMS Alpha operating system from
                 Version 6.x to Version 7.x.

                 It is not necessary to reinstall ACMS on OpenVMS VAX
                 systems that have been upgraded from OpenVMS VAX Version
                 6.x to Version 7.x.

              o  Oracle CODASYL DBMS

                 Remote access between different versions of Oracle
                 CODASYL DBMS is possible as long as features unique
                 to the newer version are not requested of a previous
                 version.

              o  Oracle Rdb

                 Rdb modules are upwardly compatible; for example,
                 modules compiled under Rdb Version 6.0 execute correctly
                 if Rdb is upgraded to Version 7.0 on the system. Remote
                 access between different versions of Rdb is possible
                 as long as features unique to the newer version are not
                 requested of the previous version.

                 Because Rdb is the base data repository for many
                 products, particularly CDD and Oracle Trace in a
                 transaction processing system, you must convert all
                 databases (RMU/CONVERT) used by these products after you
                 upgrade Rdb. Refer to the product-specific information
                 for more details.

    Planning the ACMS Installation
    1.6 Product Dependencies


          o  Oracle Trace

             Oracle Trace depends on Oracle Rdb since it provides the
             base data repository, as mentioned above. Refer to the
             product-specific information for more details.

          o  Pascal and PL/I (VAX only)

             Changes were made to the Pascal and PL/I include
             files after ACMS Version 3.1. Some changes may not be
             compatible with existing programs. If you are upgrading
             from ACMS Version 3.1, save a copy of the ACMS Version
             3.1 definition files, SYS$LIBRARY:ACMSPLI.TLB and
             SYS$LIBRARY:ACMSPAS.PAS, before installing ACMS Version
             4.4, and use these files until you make the necessary
             modifications to use the correct definitions.

          o  TDMS (VAX only)

             TDMS request libraries generated since the release of
             TDMS Version 1.7 are compatible with all later versions
             of TDMS.

                                                Preparing to Install ACMS


              This chapter discusses the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing ACMS Version 4.4.

              ACMS provides online release notes and gives you the
              option of printing or displaying the release notes during
              the installation procedure. Compaq strongly recommends
              that you read the release notes before proceeding with
              the installation in case they contain some important
              information regarding the installation procedure.

              The sections in this chapter describe requirements that
              are checked by the ACMS installation procedure. With
              the exception of optional layered products, your system
              must meet these requirements before you can install ACMS
              successfully.

        2.1 Backing Up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks
              whether you have backed up your system disk. Compaq
              recommends that you back up your system disk before
              installing any software.

              Use the backup procedures that have been established at
              your site to do this backup. For details about performing a
              system disk backup, see the section on the Backup Utility
              in the OpenVMS documentation set.

        2.2 Software Versions

              As discussed in Section 1.4, ACMS Version 4.4 requires
              minimum versions of a number of layered products. The
              installation procedure lists all layered products that do
              not meet or exceed the required minimum version. The ACMS
              Software Product Description (SPD) identifies the minimum
              software versions of required and optional products.

    Preparing to Install ACMS
    2.2 Software Versions


          If any required products are below minimum version, the
          installation fails.

    2.2.1 Installed Images

          In order to use other layered products during the
          installation of ACMS, certain executable images related
          to those products must be installed using the DCL command
          INSTALL. These images are normally installed by executing
          the startup procedure for the product. These startup
          procedures should be executed automatically when the system
          is started. Startup procedures are found in SYS$STARTUP.

          To determine whether an image is installed, execute the
          following DCL command:

          $ INSTALL LIST file-specification

          If an image is not installed, you must execute the related
          product startup procedure; also ensure that this startup
          procedure is executed automatically during system startup.

          If you are installing the ACMS development kit, the CDD
          image SYS$LIBRARY:CDDSHR.EXE must be installed. If you
          are installing the ACMS run-time kit, this is optional;
          however, if the image is not installed, CDD-related files
          will not be made available. The CDD startup procedure is
          CDDSTRTUP.COM.

          To use CDD, Rdb must also be available. Therefore, if you
          are installing the ACMS development kit, or if you plan to
          use the CDD-related function of the ACMS run-time kit, the
          Rdb image SYS$LIBRARY:RDBSHR.EXE must be installed. The Rdb
          startup procedure is RMONSTART.COM.

          If you have Oracle Trace installed on your system
          and you want the ACMS facility definition updated
          during the installation, the Oracle Trace image
          SYS$LIBRARY:EPC$FUNCSHRP.EXE must be installed. The Oracle
          Trace startup procedure is EPC$STARTUP.COM.

        2.3 Privileges

              To install ACMS, you must be logged in to the SYSTEM
              account, or any account with similar privileges. The
              SYSTEM account has all the privileges required for the
              installation.

        2.4 Disk Space

              The following sections describe the approximate disk space
              requirements for a normal installation, and an option
              for installing ACMS on a system disk with limited space
              available.

        2.4.1 Disk Space for a Normal Installation

              Installing ACMS requires a certain amount of free storage
              space during the installation. Once ACMS is installed,
              less storage space is required. Table 2-2 and Table 2-3
              summarize the approximate storage requirements for ACMS
              during and after installation. These tables reflect the
              installation of full kits, with all options selected.

              To determine the number of free disk blocks on your system
              disk, enter the following command:

              $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

        2.4.2 Installing on a Disk with Limited Space

              If your system disk has less space than indicated in
              Section 2.4.1, and if you have previously installed ACMS on
              your system disk, you may be able to install ACMS Version
              4.4 by using the VMSINSTAL Alternate Working Device (AWD)
              option.

              The AWD option allows you to specify another disk device on
              which VMSINSTAL creates its temporary working directory.

              For a normal Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS, Version 4.4
              development kit installation, VMSINSTAL creates the
              following temporary working directory:

              SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSUPD.ACMSDEVA_044]

              For an AWD installation of the same kit, the VMSINSTAL
              temporary working directory is:

              alternate-working-device:[000000.ACMSDEVA_044]

              The space required during installation indicated in
              Section 2.4.1 must be available on the alternate working
              device; this space will be available again after the
              installation is complete. You must still have at least
              5000 blocks available on the system disk to use the AWD
              option.

    Preparing to Install ACMS
    2.4 Disk Space


             ________________________ Note ________________________

             The AWD installation assumes that the ACMS Version 4.4
             is no more than 5000 blocks larger than the ACMS kit
             currently installed on your system.

             If the AWD installation does not work, you must
             make the required disk space available for a normal
             installation before installing ACMS.

             ______________________________________________________

          To determine the number of free disk blocks on your system
          disk and alternate working device, execute the following
          commands:

          $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE
          $ SHOW DEVICE alternate-working-device

    2.5 Disk Quotas

          If disk quotas are enabled on the system disk, the ACMS
          Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) fails. The
          ACMS installation procedure normally schedules the IVP to
          execute automatically after the installation is completed.
          However, if disk quotas are enabled, the installation
          procedure cancels the IVP and notifies you. You can choose
          to stop the installation and address the issue, or continue
          the installation and execute the IVP manually at a later
          time.

          To determine whether disk quotas are enabled, execute the
          following DCL command:

          $ SHOW QUOTA/DISK=SYS$SYSDEVICE

    2.6 System Parameters

          Table 2-6 and Table 2-7 list the minimum required system
          parameter values for the installation. Depending on the
          kinds of programs and applications running at your site,
          you might need higher values for some settings.

                                                    2.6 System Parameters


        2.6.1 Checking System Parameter Values

              To check the values of your system parameters, enter the
              following command at the DCL prompt to invoke SYSGEN:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN>

              At the SYSGEN> prompt, enter the SHOW command to display
              the value of each system parameter. Make sure that
              the values displayed equal or exceed the value of each
              parameter listed in Table 2-6 or Table 2-7. The following
              command displays the value for the VIRTUALPAGECNT system
              parameter:

              SYSGEN> SHOW VIRTUALPAGECNT
              Parameter Name       Current   Default    Min.    Max.   Unit  Dynamic
              --------------       -------   -------   ------  ------  ----  -------
              VIRTUALPAGECNT        270144      9216    512    1200000 Pages

              This example shows that the current value for
              VIRTUALPAGECNT is 270144.

              After you finish checking the parameters with the SHOW
              command, enter the EXIT command at the SYSGEN> prompt to
              return to DCL level.

        2.6.2 Calculating the Values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS

              To install and run ACMS, you must set the correct values
              for the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS system parameters.

              The values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS in Table 2-6 and
              Table 2-7 (excluding the value of n) indicate the number
              of unused pages or sections you must have available on
              your system for the installation to process successfully.
              To calculate whether your system has a sufficient number
              of unused global pages and global sections, perform the
              following steps:

              1. Show the current free global pages and global sections
                 using the following DCL commands:

                 $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")
                 3420
                 $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")
                 72

    Preparing to Install ACMS
    2.6 System Parameters


          2. Determine if the number of unused pages (3420 in
             the example) is equal to or greater than the number
             specified in Table 2-6 or Table 2-7. If the number
             of unused pages is less than the number listed in the
             table, increase the allocation value for GBLPAGES.

          3. Determine if the number of unused global sections (72
             in the example) is equal to or greater than the number
             specified in Table 2-6 or Table 2-7. If the value is
             less than the number required, increase the allocation
             value of the GBLSECTIONS parameter.

          Section 2.6.3 describes the procedures for increasing
          these values as well as those of other system parameters.
          Refer to the OpenVMS documentation on system management and
          operations for more information.

    2.6.3 Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN

          Use the AUTOGEN command procedure to change system
          parameters. To change system parameters with AUTOGEN, you
          must edit the following file:

          SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

          For example, to change the setting for the GBLPAGES system
          parameter, add this line to the file:

          GBLPAGES = 100000

          Now, run the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
          parameters. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

          $@SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN SAVPARAMS SETPARAMS FEEDBACK

          For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the
          instructions on modifying system parameters in the OpenVMS
          documentation on system management and operations.

    2.6.4 Setting the CLISYMTBL Dynamic System Parameter

          If the CLISYMTBL system parameter value for your system is
          less than 500, change the setting by entering the following
          series of commands:

                                                Preparing to Install ACMS
                                                    2.6 System Parameters


              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN> USE ACTIVE
              SYSGEN> SET CLISYMTBL 500
              SYSGEN> WRITE ACTIVE
              SYSGEN> EXIT

              CLISYMTBL is a dynamic parameter, which means that you
              do not have to reboot the system to make the change take
              effect. The new value for CLISYMTBL becomes effective when
              you enter the SYSGEN command WRITE ACTIVE.

              If you do nothing further, the new value for CLISYMTBL
              remains in effect until the next time you reboot the
              system, at which time the old value for CLISYMTBL is
              restored.

              If you want to make the new CLISYMTBL value permanent,
              enter the following SYSGEN command:

              SYSGEN> WRITE CURRENT

              The WRITE CURRENT command writes the new value for
              CLISYMTBL into the SYSGEN database on disk, so that it
              is available when the system is rebooted.

              To exit from SYSGEN, enter the following command:

              SYSGEN> EXIT

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you changed the value of CLISYMTBL, log out and log
                back in so that the new value can take effect.

                ______________________________________________________

        2.7 Process Account Quotas

              The account you use to install ACMS must have sufficient
              quotas to enable you to perform the installation. Table 2-8
              summarizes the process quotas required to perform the
              installation.

          User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT. Use
          the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to verify and
          change user account quotas. First set your directory to
          SYS$SYSTEM and then run AUTHORIZE:

          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
          $ RUN AUTHORIZE
          UAF>

          At the AUTHORIZE prompt (UAF>), enter the SHOW command with
          an account name to check a particular account. For example:

          UAF> SHOW SYSTEM

          To change a quota, enter the MODIFY command at the UAF>
          prompt. MODIFY has the following format:

          MODIFY account-name/quota-name=nnnn

          The following example changes the FILLM quota for the
          SYSTEM account and then exits from the Authorize Utility:

          UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM/FILLM=200
          UAF> EXIT

          After you exit from the utility, the OpenVMS system
          displays messages indicating whether or not changes were
          made. Once the changes have been made, you must log out and
          log in again for the new quotas to take effect.

          For more information on modifying account quotas, see
          the description of the Authorize Utility in the OpenVMS
          documentation on system management and operations.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Installation time depends heavily on installation
                options, system load, hardware, and kit media. The
                times listed in Table 2-9 were measured for full
                installations on a standalone DEC 3000 (Alpha) system
                with disk-resident kits. Your time may vary.

        2.9 ACMS$IVP User Authorization

              The ACMS installation checks for the presence of the
              OpenVMS user account ACMS$IVP. If this account does not
              exist, you are asked for information needed to create it.
              The ACMS$IVP account is used to run the ACMS Installation
              Verification Procedure.

              Among the information requested for this account is
              a unique user identification code (UIC) in the form
              [ggggg,nnnnnn], where ggggg is an octal user group number
              in the range 1-37776, and nnnnnn is an octal user number in
              the range 1-177776. Additionally, the group number cannot
              be a system group number.

    Preparing to Install ACMS
    2.9 ACMS$IVP User Authorization


          Enter the following commands to list the UICs currently in
          use on your system:

          $ MCR AUTHORIZE
          UAF> LIST * /BRIEF

          The result of these commands is that all UICs in use on
          your system are listed in the file SYSUAF.LIS, in your
          default directory. You can then examine this listing to
          determine a unique UIC for the ACMS$IVP account.

          On your system, a certain range of group numbers has been
          reserved for system users. To determine this range, execute
          the following commands:

          $ MAXSYS = F$GETSYI("MAXSYSGROUP")
          $ SHOW SYMBOL MAXSYS

          The value you supply for the octal group number in the
          ACMS$IVP UIC must be greater than the octal value of
          the symbol MAXSYS. The following example shows that the
          maximum system group number is octal 10; therefore, you
          must specify a group number for the ACMS$IVP UIC that is in
          the range 11-37776:

          $ MAXSYS = F$GETSYI("MAXSYSGROUP")
          $ SHOW SYMBOL MAXSYS
            MAXSYS = 8   Hex = 00000008   Octal = 00000000010

                                                          Installing ACMS


              This chapter describes how to install the ACMS software.
              Section 3.2 contains a step-by-step description of the
              installation procedure.

        3.1 Installation Log

              A log of your installation is kept in the following file:

              SYS$COMMON:[SYSUPD]ACMS044_INSTALLATION.LOG

              In particular, if the ACMS installation fails because
              prerequisites were not met, this log contains a list of
              those prerequisites. You can use it as a check list of
              items to address before you reinstall ACMS.

              In addition, after the installation is completed, a list
              of the files created by the installation is stored in the
              following file:

              SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMS044_FILES.DAT

        3.2 Installation Procedure

              ACMS provides online release notes. The prompt to display
              or print the release notes before the installation appears
              in the installation procedure, if you invoke VMSINSTAL with
              the OPTIONS N parameter. For information on accessing the
              release notes after the installation, refer to Section 3.4.

              The ACMS installation process is divided into five phases:

              o  The first phase consists of invoking VMSINSTAL and
                 supplying information such as which kit to install,
                 where the kit resides, and other installation options.
                 Section 3.2.1 explains the first phase.

    Installing ACMS
    3.2 Installation Procedure


          o  The second phase consists of a series of questions,
             checks, and informational messages related to ACMS.
             This phase ensures that the installation environment
             is sufficient to support the actual installation work
             that occurs in the third phase. The second phase ends
             when you are shown a summary of what happens in the
             third phase and are asked whether you want to continue.
             Chapter 2 has information to help you answer the
             questions asked in the second phase; if you have not
             read Chapter 2 in preparation for this installation, do
             so now. Section 3.2.2 takes you step by step through the
             second phase of the installation.

          o  The third phase is the actual installation work. This
             usually includes restoring kit savesets, providing
             files to system directories, creating the ACMS$IVP user
             account, updating the LSE and Oracle Trace environments,
             updating DCL tables and help libraries, and other steps
             as enumerated at the end of the second phase. No user
             interaction is required during this phase. Section 3.2.3
             explains the messages that you might see during this
             phase.

          o  The fourth phase is the ACMS postinstallation procedure.
             This procedure, which executes automatically after
             the ACMS software is installed, performs the minimum
             system management operations that are necessary to allow
             ACMS to be used on the system. Section 3.2.4 guides you
             through the postinstallation phase.

          o  The fifth phase is the ACMS Installation Verification
             Procedure (IVP). This procedure performs a series of
             exercises to ensure that ACMS is properly installed
             and usable on your system. Section 3.2.5 discusses the
             execution of the IVP.

          To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
          <Ctrl/Y>. When you press <Ctrl/Y>, the installation
          procedure deletes all files it has created up to that point
          and exits. You can then start the installation again.

                                               3.2 Installation Procedure


        3.2.1 Invoking VMSINSTAL (First Phase)

              To start the installation, log in to the SYSTEM account,
              and set default to the SYS$UPDATE directory:

              Username: SYSTEM
              Password:
              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE

              Next, invoke VMSINSTAL. Use the following syntax to invoke
              VMSINSTAL:

              @VMSINSTAL product-name device-name [OPTIONS option-
        1[,...]]

              product-name
              The installation name for the component. Enter one of the
              following:

              o  ACMSDEVA_044 - if you are installing the Alpha
                 development kit.

              o  ACMSRTOA_044 - if you are installing the Alpha run-time
                 kit.

              o  ACMSREMA_044 - if you are installing the Alpha remote-
                 access kit.

              o  ACMSDEVV_044 - if you are installing the VAX development
                 kit.

              o  ACMSRTOV_044 - if you are installing the VAX run-time
                 kit.

              o  ACMSREMV_044 - if you are installing the VAX remote-
                 access kit.

              device-name
              The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
              media. For example, CDROM is the device name for a tape
              drive.

              OPTIONS
              An optional parameter indicating that one or more VMSINSTAL
              options are being supplied. This parameter is followed
              by a space, and then the requested options. If multiple
              options are requested, separate them with commas (,); do
              not include spaces in the options list.

    Installing ACMS
    3.2 Installation Procedure


          The following are VMSINSTAL options that you can use for
          the ACMS installation:

          o  N-The release notes option causes VMSINSTAL to prompt
             you to display or print the ACMS release notes during
             the installation. (Release notes are always copied to
             SYS$HELP during an installation, whether or not this
             option is specified.)

          o  AWD-The alternate working device option allows you
             specify an alternate disk device on which to create the
             temporary working directory used by VMSINSTAL during a
             product installation. This option allows you to perform
             an installation with fewer free blocks on the system
             disk than are otherwise required.

             Specify the AWD option using the following format:

             AWD=device

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Use the AWD option only if you have previously
             installed ACMS and you do not have sufficient space
             on your system disk to perform a normal installation.
             If you have not previously installed ACMS, you must
             have the disk space listed in Table 2-2 or Table 2-3
             available to accommodate the ACMS software.

             ______________________________________________________

             See Section 2.4.2 for more information on using the AWD
             option.

          VMSINSTAL has several other options; for information, see
          the OpenVMS documentation on software installation.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             ACMS does not support option R, the alternate root
             option.

             ______________________________________________________

          On Alpha, the following command invokes VMSINSTAL and
          installs ACMS from the CD-ROM reader. This example uses
          the N option for printing or displaying release notes, and
          the AWD option to use disk DISK1 as an alternate working
          device:

              It is 22-JUN-2001 at 11:00.
              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              If you do not supply either the product name or the device
              name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information later on
              in the installation procedure.

              1. System backup

                 VMSINSTAL asks the following question to ensure that
                 your system disk is properly backed up:

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                 Always back up your system disk before performing an
                 installation. If you are satisfied with the backup of
                 your system disk, press <Return>. Otherwise, answer NO
                 to stop the installation. After you back up your system
                 disk, you can restart the installation.

    Installing ACMS
    3.2 Installation Procedure


          2. Mounting the media

             VMSINSTAL instructs you to mount the ACMS Version 4.4
             distribution media on the device you specified when
             you invoked VMSINSTAL. When you have mounted the media,
             answer YES to the question, "Are you ready?":

             Please mount the first volume of the set on CDROM.
             * Are you ready? Y

             If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
             VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation,
             answer NO in response to the question. To abort the
             installation for any other reason, press <Ctrl/Y>.

             VMSINSTAL then reads the media and begins the
             installation of ACMS. A message similar to the following
             appears:

             %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, ACMSDEVA_044 MOUNTED ON _$200$DISK1:

             The following products will be processed:

               ACMSDEVA_ V4.4

                     Beginning installation of ACMSDEVA_ V4.4 at 11:01

             %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

          3. Release notes

             If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL,
             you are now given several options for reviewing the
             release notes.

                 Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

                 Additional Release Notes Options:

                     1. Display release notes
                     2. Print release notes
                     3. Both 1 and 2
                     4. None of the above

             * Select option [2]:

             If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
             notes immediately. You can terminate the display at any
             time by pressing <Ctrl/C>. Because the release notes are
             lengthy, it is recommended that you choose option 2 to

                                               3.2 Installation Procedure


                 print the release notes rather than reviewing them on
                 line.

                 If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for the
                 name of the print queue that you want to use:

                 * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                 You can enter a queue name or just press <Return>
                 to send the file to the default output print queue
                 SYS$PRINT.

                 If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes immediately and then prompts you for a queue name
                 for the printed version.

                 If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL does not display or
                 print the release notes. Use the DCL command TYPE or
                 PRINT to view the release notes in the following file:

                 SYS$HELP:ACMS044.RELEASE_NOTES

                 The release notes are copied to the SYS$HELP directory
                 under all circumstances, regardless of your choice from
                 the menu.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The release notes for each version of ACMS are
                uniquely named so that release notes from multiple
                versions can be maintained. To facilitate comparison
                of various versions of ACMS, Compaq recommends not
                deleting release notes for previous versions of ACMS.

                ______________________________________________________

              4. Continuing the installation

                 The installation procedure now asks if you want to
                 continue the installation. To continue, answer YES.
                 Otherwise, press <Return> to stop the installation:

                 * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: Y
                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to
                              SYS$HELP.

    Installing ACMS
    3.2 Installation Procedure


             After you read the release notes, you can restart the
             installation without being questioned about the release
             notes by removing OPTIONS N from the VMSINSTAL command.
             For example:

             $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL ACMSDEVA_044 CDROM:

    3.2.2 Product-Specific Questions (Second Phase)

          This section discusses the questions and messages that
          apply specifically to the installation of ACMS Version 4.4.
          Depending on the kit and options that you choose, some of
          the steps listed here might not apply to your installation.
          This discussion assumes that you are installing the OpenVMS
          Alpha development kit (ACMSDEVA_044). See Appendix A for a
          sample installation of the ACMS OpenVMS Alpha development
          kit and of the ACMS OpenVMS VAX development kit.

          Each question in the installation is marked with an
          asterisk (*)  at the beginning of the line. Some questions
          show the default response in brackets, for example, [YES].
          To choose the default response, press <Return>.

          1. Selecting installation options

             The product-specific installation procedure begins
             execution. The following message is displayed:

             The results of this installation are being logged in
               SYS$COMMON:[SYSUPD]ACMS044_INSTALLATION.LOG

             Installing ACMS V4.4-0, development kit

             The procedure then asks what portions of the
             installation you want to perform. It lists the optional
             parts of the installation, and asks if you want to do
             the full installation. If you answer YES, the full
             installation is done; if you answer NO, you are asked
             individually whether you want to perform each optional
             part of the installation.

             In this example, the full installation is selected:

                                               3.2 Installation Procedure


                 There are five optional parts to the ACMS development kit installation:

                     o  ACMS component software
                     o  ACMS LSE update
                     o  ACMS samples
                     o  ACMS Request Interface samples
                     o  ACMS WBEM related files

                 The full installation includes all these parts.
                 If ACMS component software is selected, the ACMS WBEM related files will
                 also be copied.

                 To install the ACMS samples or the ACMS Request Interface samples, you must
                 install, or have previously installed, the ACMS component software.

              2. Checking installation prerequisites

                 The installation now checks that all ACMS installation
                 prerequisites are met. These prerequisites are discussed
                 in Chapter 2. The following message is displayed:

                 CHECKING INSTALLATION PREREQUISITES
                 -----------------------------------

                 A message is also displayed for any prerequisites
                 that are not met. For example, the following message
                 indicates that the optional DECtrace software is not
                 installed:

                 The following software products are not available, or are below the minimum
                 required version:

                   Product               Required  Minimum version  Current version
                   --------------------  --------  ---------------  ---------------
                   LSE                   No        V4.3             V4.2-17

                 If products marked as nonrequired are to be used with ACMS, they should be
                 upgraded to at least the minimum version displayed before use.

                 (required and optional software checked)

                 (product licenses checked)

                 (installed images checked)

    3.2 Installation Procedure


             (disk quotas checked)

             (system parameters checked)

             (process account quotas checked)

             These messages are also logged in the following file:

             SYS$UPDATE:ACMS044_INSTALLATION.LOG

             If any of the prerequisites are not met (with the
             exception of those related to optional software), the
             installation is aborted and a message similar to the
             following is displayed:

             ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
             Installation of ACMS is aborting because prerequisites are not met
               at 12:00 on 22-JUN-2001
             ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

             At this point, address all the prerequisites that were
             not met, and then restart the installation of ACMS.

          3. Checking for previous ACMS installations

             The installation procedure checks to see if you have
             previously installed ACMS. If you have, some cleanup
             from the previous installation might be necessary; this
             is the case, for example, if you previously installed a
             development kit, and you are now installing a run-time
             kit.

             The following message shows that no cleanup is
             necessary:

             ACMS PREVIOUS INSTALLATION
             --------------------------

                 (previous installation of ACMS is compatible with current installation)

             If cleanup is necessary, you are given the option to
             see a list of files that will be removed from the system
             disk during the installation.

          4. Reviewing the LSE informational message

             If you chose the LSE update option at the beginning of
             the installation, or if you chose the full installation,
             the installation advises you whether or not it can
             perform the LSE update. LSE cannot be updated if the

                                               3.2 Installation Procedure


                 optional LSE software is not present or if it is below
                 the minimum version.

                 The following message advises you that the LSE update
                 will take place as requested:

                 ACMS LSE CHECK
                 --------------

                     (LSE available -- LSE will be updated for ACMS)

                 Later on you are asked if you want to continue the
                 installation. If you were informed that LSE would not
                 be updated, you can continue the installation, then
                 install LSE and reinstall ACMS at your convenience,
                 using the LSE update option; or you can stop the
                 installation, install LSE, and then restart the complete
                 ACMS installation.

              5. Reviewing the WBEM Files

                 The installation advises you whether or not the files
                 necessary for the Compaq Web-Based Enterprise Management
                 (WBEM) environment are already present. The Remote
                 Manager web agent software cannot be used if the
                 appropriate WBEM software is not present or if it is
                 below the minimum version.

                 The following message advises you that the verification
                 of the WBEM files will take place:

                 ACMS WBEM CHECK
                 -------------------

              6. Reviewing the Oracle Trace informational message

                 The installation advises you whether or not it can
                 perform the Oracle Trace update. Oracle Trace cannot
                 be updated if the optional Oracle Trace software is not
                 present or if it is below the minimum version.

                 The following message advises you that the Oracle Trace
                 update will take place:

                 ACMS Oracle Trace CHECK
                 -------------------

                     (Oracle Trace available and will be updated for ACMS)

    Installing ACMS
    3.2 Installation Procedure


             Later on you are asked if you want to continue the
             installation. If you were informed that Oracle Trace
             would not be updated, you can continue the installation.
             If Oracle Trace is not available, the ACMS facility
             definition is stored in a text library specific to
             Oracle Trace, which is used to update the Oracle Trace
             facility database when Oracle Trace is installed. You
             do not have to reinstall ACMS after installing Oracle
             Trace.

          7. Reviewing the CDD informational message

             If you are installing a run-time kit, the installation
             advises you whether CDD is available. The availability
             of CDD affects the features provided by the run-time
             kit. See Section 1.4.2 for an explanation of these
             features.

             The following message advises you that CDD is available:

             ACMS CDD CHECK
             --------------

                 (CDD available -- CDD-related files will be installed)

             Later on you are asked if you want to continue the
             installation. If you were informed that ACMS files
             related to CDD would not be installed, you can continue
             the installation, then install CDD and reinstall ACMS
             at your convenience, using the CDD related files option;
             or you can stop the installation, install CDD, and then
             restart the complete ACMS installation.

          8. Reviewing the old sample files informational message

             If you chose the ACMS samples option at the beginning of
             the installation, or if you chose the full installation,
             the installation checks for old samples from a
             previous installation. These samples are stored in
             SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.ACMS], and they are
             superseded by examples supplied with this kit. They
             are deleted automatically during the installation.

             The following message advises you that no old samples
             were found:

                 ACMS OLD SAMPLE FILES
                 ---------------------

                     (no old sample files found)

                 Later on you are asked if you want to continue the
                 installation. If you want to preserve these old samples,
                 stop the installation, rename the sample files to a
                 different directory, and then reinstall ACMS.

              9. Reviewing the ACMS shutdown informational message

                 If you chose the ACMS component software option at
                 the beginning of the installation, or if you chose the
                 full installation, the installation checks for the ACMS
                 shutdown procedure:

                 SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTOP.COM

                 If this procedure is found, the ACMS installation
                 procedure executes it to ensure that previously
                 installed ACMS software is not running during the
                 installation. This shutdown occurs after you choose
                 to continue the installation in a subsequent step.

                 The following message advises you that ACMSTOP.COM was
                 found:

                 ACMS SHUTDOWN CHECK
                 -------------------

                     (ACMSTOP.COM found -- ACMS will be shut down during installation)

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you have previously installed ACMS on this system,
                and if ACMSTOP.COM is not found, ensure that the
                ACMS system is shut down before continuing with the
                installation.

                ______________________________________________________

             10. Reviewing the postinstallation procedure informational
                 message

    Installing ACMS
    3.2 Installation Procedure


             If you chose the ACMS component software at the
             beginning of the installation, or if you chose the
             full installation, the installation procedure advises
             you whether or not it can execute the postinstallation
             procedure automatically. The postinstallation procedure
             cannot be executed if you do not have the required
             privileges enabled.

             The following message advises you that the ACMS
             postinstallation procedure will be executed
             automatically:

             ACMS POSTINSTALLATION PROCEDURE
             -------------------------------

                 (postinstallation procedure will be run automatically after installation)

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Refer to Chapter 4 for important information on other
             steps to take before using ACMS on your system.

             ______________________________________________________

         11. Reviewing the system roots check informational message

             The installation checks for ACMS files in system-
             specific roots. If you previously installed ACMS,
             certain files might exist in system-specific roots. With
             a few exceptions (for example, ACMSPAR.ACM) ACMS files
             should reside in cluster-common directories such as
             SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]. Some ACMS files might have migrated
             to system-specific roots as a result of maintenance or
             other activities performed on the previous version of
             ACMS. If ACMS files have migrated in this manner, and
             you then upgrade to a higher version of ACMS, you might
             subsequently encounter problems running ACMS across a
             cluster, such as problems related to a version mismatch
             or the inability to access new functionality on some
             nodes.

             The installation checks for ACMS files that might have
             migrated inadvertently to system-specific roots, and
             lists any files it finds. Compaq recommends that you
             check any files listed to ensure that they do not

             -----------------------

                 (no ACMS-related files found in system-specific roots)

         12. Choosing to execute the IVP

             You are now asked whether you want to execute the ACMS
             Installation Verification Procedure (IVP). This question
             is asked if you are installing ACMS software (as opposed
             to installing samples or updating the LSE environment,
             for example).

             Compaq recommends that you run the IVP automatically
             after the installation, to ensure that the installation
             was successful. Chapter 5 contains more information on
             the IVP, including how to execute it manually at a later
             time.

             The following question is asked to determine whether
             you want to run the IVP automatically; press <Return> to
             accept the default answer, YES:

             ACMS IVP
             --------

             * Do you want to execute the Installation Verification Procedure [YES]?

             If you choose to execute the IVP, the installation now
             checks for the IVP user account ACMS$IVP. If the account
             ACMS$IVP does not exist, you are asked to supply a user
             identification code (UIC) and password for this account.
             The information you supply is used to create the account
             in the third phase of the installation.

                                               3.2 Installation Procedure


                 This example shows how to supply a UIC and password for
                 the ACMS$IVP account:

                 The ACMS$IVP account used to execute the IVP is not available.

                   You must supply a UIC and password for this account so that it can be
                   created; this must be done before the IVP can be executed.

                   Please enter the UIC for the ACMS$IVP account, in the form [ggggg,nnnnnn]

                 * UIC: [400,200]

                   Please enter a password of at least 8 characters, using only
                   the following characters: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789$_

                 * Password:
                 * Verification:

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The password and verification are not echoed when you
                type them.

                ______________________________________________________

                 Refer to Section 2.9 for more information on selecting a
                 valid UIC for the ACMS$IVP account.

             13. Choosing to continue the installation

                 At this time, the installation procedure lists the steps
                 to complete the installation, and an approximate time
                 for the rest of the installation. It then asks if you
                 want to continue. If issues remain that you must address
                 before the installation continues, answer NO to stop the
                 installation.

                 The following example shows the work list for a typical
                 development installation; the lists for run-time and
                 remote-access installations are different.

                 SUMMARY OF THIS ACMS INSTALLATION

    Installing ACMS
    3.2 Installation Procedure


             o  The ACMS system will be shut down (via SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTOP.COM)
             o  ACMS component software will be installed
             o  WBEM environment will be updated for ACMS
             o  LSE environment will be updated for ACMS
             o  Oracle Trace facility database will be updated for ACMS
             o  CDD-related ACMS files will be installed
             o  ACMS samples will be installed
             o  ACMS Request Interface samples will be installed
             o  The ACMS postinstallation procedure will be executed
             o  The ACMS IVP will be executed

             The rest of this installation will take approximately 7 minutes.
             Execution of the IVP will take approximately 2 minutes.

             Note that this time is heavily dependent your system load, hardware
             and kit media. The time mentioned was measured on a stand-alone DEC 3000
             (Alpha)  system with a disk-resident kit.  Your time may vary.

    3.2.3 Informational Messages (Third Phase)

          In the third installation phase, the actual work of the
          installation takes place; restoring savesets, moving
          files, updating databases, and so on. This phase has no
          user interaction. At the beginning of the phase, a message
          similar to the following is displayed:

              Installation of ACMS started
                at 11:02 on 22-JUN-2001

          Following this message, the installation procedure displays
          a number of informational messages that report on the
          progress of the installation.

          If any errors are encountered in this phase, the
          installation aborts and a message similar to the following
          is displayed:

              ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
              Installation of ACMS is aborting because errors were encountered
                at 13:25 on 22-JUN-2001
              ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

          If you receive this message, use information in previous
          error messages and the installation log to fix the problem,
          and then reinstall ACMS.

                                                          Installing ACMS
                                               3.2 Installation Procedure


              When the third phase is successfully completed, a message
              similar to the following is displayed:

                  Installation of ACMS completed successfully
                    at 11:07 on 22-JUN-2001

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories...

              During the ACMS installation, VMSINSTAL operates in safety
              mode, which means that it defers file operations until
              the third phase has successfully completed. The VMSINSTAL-
              I-MOVEFILES message indicates that these deferred file
              operations are now being performed.

        3.2.4 Running the Postinstallation Procedure (Fourth Phase)

              If you were informed during the second phase of the
              installation that the ACMS postinstallation procedure would
              be executed, it is done at this time. A message similar to
              the following is displayed:

                  ACMS postinstallation procedure started
                    at 11:09 on 22-JUN-2001

              The postinstallation procedure performs the following
              steps:

              1. Checking the ACMS$DIRECTORY logical name

                 The procedure checks for the presence of the logical
                 name ACMS$DIRECTORY. If this logical name is defined,
                 it must be in /SYSTEM /SUPERVISOR mode, and it must
                 point to an existing directory. If ACMS$DIRECTORY is not
                 defined or is improperly defined, the procedure asks you
                 for information so that it can define the logical name.

                 The following message shows that ACMS$DIRECTORY is
                 properly defined:

                     ACMS$DIRECTORY is defined as MGR$:[ACMS.DIRECTORY]
                     ACMS$DIRECTORY logical is acceptable

              2. Converting ACMSGEN parameter files

                 The procedure asks if you want to convert existing
                 ACMSGEN parameter files. If you answer YES, or press
                 <Return> to accept the default answer, the procedure
                 searches for all ACMSGEN parameter files located in
                 SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS*.SYSEXE] and SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE], and
                 converts them to be compatible with ACMS Version 4.4.

    Installing ACMS
    3.2 Installation Procedure


             The following message shows the ACMSGEN convert
             question, and typical output from the conversion
             process:

             Do you want to convert existing ACMSGEN parameter files [Y]?

                 Converting SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYSEXE]ACMSPAR.ACM

             The ACMSGEN parameter files listed above have been converted; if
             other parameter files exist on your system, they must be updated as
             follows:

                     $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:ACMSGEN
                     ACMSGEN> USE file-specification
                     ACMSGEN> WRITE file-specification
                     ACMSGEN> EXIT

                                                          Installing ACMS
                                               3.2 Installation Procedure


              3. Converting ACMS UDF and DDF files

                 The procedure asks if you want to convert existing
                 ACMS UDF and DDF parameter files. If you answer YES,
                 or press <Return> to accept the default answer, the
                 procedure searches for the files pointed to by the
                 logical names ACMSUDF and ACMSDDF, if these logicals
                 are defined, and then for ACMSUDF.DAT and ACMSDDF.DAT in
                 SYS$SYSROOT:[SYS*], and converts them to be compatible
                 with ACMS Version 4.4.

                 The following message shows the ACMS UDF and DDF
                 convert question, and typical output from the conversion
                 process:

                 Do you want to convert existing ACMS UDF and DDF files [Y]?

                     Converting UDF file SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSUDF.DAT
                     Converting DDF file SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSDDF.DAT

              4. Checking for ACMS UDF and DDF files

                 The procedure checks for the presence of ACMS DDF
                 and UDF files. It first tries to locate these files
                 through the /SYSTEM /EXECUTIVE logical names ACMSUDF and
                 ACMSDDF, if they exist. The procedure then checks for
                 ACMSUDF.DAT and ACMSDDF.DAT in SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]. If
                 the files are not found in either manner, the procedure
                 creates them.

                 The following message shows that the logical names
                 do not exist, but that the files were found in
                 SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]:

                     No /SYSTEM /EXECUTIVE logical ACMSUDF found
                     SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSUDF exists

                     No /SYSTEM /EXECUTIVE logical ACMSDDF found
                     SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSDDF exists

              5. Checking for ACMS_SETUP.COM

                 The procedure checks for the presence of ACMS_SETUP.COM
                 in SYS$STARTUP. If the file does not exist, it is
                 created. This is a template for site-specific commands
                 related to the startup of ACMS. ACMS_SETUP.COM is
                 executed by ACMSTART.COM, which is normally executed
                 during system startup to start the ACMS software.

    Installing ACMS
    3.2 Installation Procedure


             Chapter 4 explains how to modify this template to
             address your specific needs regarding ACMS startup.

             If ACMS_SETUP.COM already exists, the ACMS_SETUP_NEW.COM
             template file is created. After the installation, review
             this template file to see if you need to add any new
             commands to your existing ACMS_SETUP.COM.

             The following message shows that the ACMS_SETUP.COM
             already exists, and that the template file ACMS_SETUP_
             NEW.COM is being created:

                 SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]ACMS_SETUP.COM already exists

                 Creating SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]ACMS_SETUP_NEW.COM

             Please review the contents of ACMS_SETUP_NEW.COM to determine whether there
             are any commands you should add to your existing ACMS_SETUP.COM.

          6. Checking for ACMS menu files

             The procedure checks in ACMS$DIRECTORY for the ACMS
             command menu ACMSCMD.MDB, and the default user menu
             ACMS.MDB, and copies them into that directory if they
             do not exist. The following message shows that the menu
             files already exist in ACMS$DIRECTORY:

                 ACMS$DIRECTORY:ACMSCMD.MDB already exists -- not copied
                 ACMS$DIRECTORY:ACMS.MDB already exists -- not copied

          7. Checking for ACMS$MGMT_SETUP files

             The procedure checks for ACMS$MGMT_SETUP and Remote
             Manager configuration files and asks if you want to set
             up and configure the Remote Manager.

             Do you want to SETUP and CONFIGURE the ACMS Remote System Manager [Y]?
                 Creating SYS$STARTUP:ACMS$MGMT_SETUP.COM

             If you respond yes, the procedure asks you a series of
             questions concerning Remote Manager configuration. Refer
             to the Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS Remote Systems Management
             Guide for more information about Remote Manager setup.

             When the postinstallation procedure is completed, a
             message similar to the following is displayed:

        3.2.5 Running the Installation Verification Procedure (Fifth
              Phase)

              If you were informed during the second phase of the
              installation that the ACMS Installation Verification
              Procedure (IVP) would be executed, it is done at this time.
              A message similar to the following is displayed:

                  ACMS Installation Verification Procedure started
                    at 11:10 on 22-JUN-2001

              The IVP is then invoked. It displays several informational
              messages to inform you of its progress. Refer to Chapter 5
              for more information on the ACMS IVP.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If the ACMS IVP is not invoked automatically during
                the installation, invoke it manually at your earliest
                convenience after the installation.

                ______________________________________________________

              When the ACMS IVP is completed, a message similar to the
              following is displayed:

    Installing ACMS
    3.2 Installation Procedure


    3.2.6 Completing the Installation

          The following message indicates that the entire ACMS
          installation is complete:

          Installation of ACMSDEVA_ V4.4 completed at 11:12

          You can now log out of the privileged SYSTEM account:

          $ LOGOUT
          SYSTEM     logged out at 22-JUN-2001 11:13:01.55

          VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process symbol
          tables during the installation. Therefore, if you are
          going to continue using the SYSTEM account and you want
          to restore these symbols, log out and log in again.

    3.3 Recovering from System and Installation Failures

          An unsuccessful installation can result from a system
          failure or errors encountered during the installation
          procedure. In some cases, you must correct the problem
          and reinstall ACMS. In other cases, you can continue where
          you left off. The following sections describe various
          failure scenarios and the recommended procedure to follow
          to recover from them.

    3.3.1 System Failures

          If you experience a system failure, such as a power loss
          during installation, VMSINSTAL automatically attempts
          to continue the installation when you reboot the system.
          Depending on the point in the installation at which the
          system failed, one of three conditions exists:

          o  The system disk did not undergo any changes before the
             system failure. VMSINSTAL instructs you to restart the
             installation.

          o  The system disk used by the installation was corrupted.
             VMSINSTAL instructs you to restore the system disk from
             the backup copy and restart the installation.

          o  VMSINSTAL continues the installation and then might
             tell you to manually purge replaced files, even if you
             requested that they be purged automatically. You can
             purge files, but remember that purging deletes all but
             the latest version of all files on your system disk. If
             you have multiple versions of system files that you want

                     3.3 Recovering from System and Installation Failures


                 to save, you can delete just the ACMS files you want
                 to remove from system directories. If you want to purge
                 files, reboot the system, log in to the SYSTEM account,
                 and purge all system files using the following command:

                 $ PURGE/LOG SYS$SYSROOT:[*...]*.*

                 When you have performed this task, the installation is
                 complete.

              If the system fails after you see the message that
              indicates the beginning of the ACMS IVP, VMSINSTAL has
              already completed the installation of the component
              software. In this case, when you reboot your system,
              VMSINSTAL displays the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-RECOVER, ACMSDEVA_ V4.4 was being installed when the system crashed.

              The installation completed satisfactorily.

              This message indicates that VMSINSTAL has finished
              successfully, not that the installation of ACMS was
              successful.

              VMSINSTAL does not automatically restart the IVP. You can
              run the IVP independently by following the steps described
              in Chapter 5.

        3.3.2 ACMS Installation Failures

              If the installation of the ACMS software fails for some
              reason other than a system failure, the installation
              procedure displays a message telling you the cause of
              the failure. To continue with the installation, you must
              correct the condition causing the error and restart the
              installation procedure from the beginning.

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exist:

              o  Operating system version is incorrect.

              o  Prerequisite software version is incorrect.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  System parameter values for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

    Installing ACMS
    3.3 Recovering from System and Installation Failures


          o  OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

          For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
          conditions, see the OpenVMS documentation on system
          messages, recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software
          installations. If you are notified that any of these
          conditions exist, take the appropriate action as described
          in the message. (For example, you might need to change
          a system parameter or increase a quota value.) For
          information on installation requirements, see Chapter 2.

          If the installation of the component software completes
          satisfactorily, but a test or operation fails during the
          IVP, the IVP displays a message describing the failure and
          suggests a course of action. In most cases, the suggested
          course of action is to reinstall ACMS. The failure could
          be due to low settings for the SYSGEN parameters GBLPAGES,
          GBLSECTIONS, GBLPAGFIL, or to an insufficient number of
          process slots. Check the ACMS Software Event Log for a
          message that indicates the source of the problem. If the
          IVP fails after you reinstall ACMS, contact your local
          Compaq Customer Support Center.

    3.3.3 Recovering from Errors

          You can run the ACMS IVP separately after you install ACMS
          by following the instructions in Chapter 5. As the IVP
          executes, it checks the success of each test and operation
          it performs. If any test or operation fails, the IVP
          displays a message describing the failure and suggests a
          course of action. Follow the suggested course of action
          and then restart the IVP as described in Chapter 5. If
          the action you take is to reinstall ACMS, the IVP runs
          automatically if you answer YES to the IVP question. If you
          still cannot successfully run the IVP, contact your local
          Compaq Customer Support Center.

    3.4 Accessing the Online Release Notes

          After ACMS has been installed, the release notes are
          located in the following file:

              $ HELP ACMS RELEASE_NOTES

              Hardcopy release notes are not included with the
              documentation set for ACMS.

        3.5 Files Installed on Your System

              The files added to your system by the ACMS installation are
              listed in:

              SYS$SYSTEM:ACMS044_FILES.DAT

              You can display or print this file after you install ACMS.

              ACMS Version Identification File (ACMS_ECO_LEVEL.DAT)

              Starting with the ACMS Version 4.0 ECO Kit 1 release, a
              file named ACMS_ECO_LEVEL.DAT is distributed with the kit.
              This file is placed in the SYS$SYSTEM directory during
              installation.

              ACMS_ECO_LEVEL.DAT contains the version identifier for the
              ACMS release that is currently installed on the system.
              This file is distributed for all releases, including full
              releases, that have an ECO level of 0. If you report any
              problems with ACMS, refer to this file to determine the
              current ACMS version number. The version in this file
              may be more current than the version numbers that appear
              throughout the ACMS system, especially when running with an
              ECO release.

                                                    After Installing ACMS


              This chapter describes system management tasks that you
              perform manually after installing ACMS Version 4.4. These
              tasks might include:

              o  Executing the ACMS postinstallation procedure
                 manually (if it was not executed automatically during
                 installation)

              o  Editing system startup and shutdown procedures to
                 include ACMS

              o  Editing the ACMS site-specific startup procedure ACMS_
                 SETUP.COM

              o  Modifying ACMS parameters

              o  Authorizing applications, devices, users, and processes

              o  Creating and modifying ACMS user accounts

              o  Setting up ACMS on an OpenVMS Cluster system

              o  Enabling distributed ACMS processing

              o  Rebuilding the LSE environment

              o  Preparing language-specific ACMS development
                 environments

              The following sections describe these tasks.

        4.1 Executing the ACMS Postinstallation Procedure

              If you were notified during the ACMS installation that the
              postinstallation procedure would not be run automatically,
              execute it now.

                                                After Installing ACMS 4-1

 



    After Installing ACMS
    4.1 Executing the ACMS Postinstallation Procedure


          To execute the postinstallation procedure manually, use the
          following commands:

          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$MANAGER
          $ @ACMS_POST_INSTALL.COM

          See Section 3.2.4 for more information on the steps
          performed by the postinstallation procedure.

    4.2 Editing System Startup and Shutdown Procedures

          You must edit the OpenVMS system startup and shutdown
          procedures to provide for automatic startup and shutdown
          of ACMS when your system is rebooted. (This step is usually
          not necessary for system upgrades.)

    4.2.1 Editing the System Startup Procedure

          Add the following DCL command to the system startup
          procedure:

          $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTART.COM

          For sites that have modularized startup procedures,
          be sure to add the command to the correct procedure.
          The default startup command procedure for OpenVMS VAX
          starting with Version 6.x and for OpenVMS Alpha systems
          is SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.

          Position the ACMS startup command after the commands that
          start software on which ACMS relies. In particular, start
          ACMS after the network, DECdtm, and DECforms are started,
          and before TP Desktop Connector is started. For example:

          $ @SYS$STARTUP:STARTNET.COM
          $ @SYS$STARTUP:DECDTM$STARTUP.COM
          $ @SYS$STARTUP:FORMS$STARTUP.COM
          $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTART.COM
          $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSDI$STARTUP.COM

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             The network must be running before ACMS is started, if
             you are going to use distributed ACMS processing.

        4.2.2 Installing ACMS Images as Resident on OpenVMS Alpha

              On OpenVMS Alpha systems, your application performance
              may improve by installing certain ACMS images as resident
              with the OpenVMS Install utility. Installing images as
              resident allows them to take advantage of the OpenVMS Alpha
              image-slicing feature.

              The code sections of an image installed as resident reside
              in huge pages called granularity hint regions (GHRs) in
              memory. The Alpha hardware can consider a set of pages as a
              single GHR. This GHR can be mapped by a single page table
              entry (PTE) in the translation buffer (TB). The result
              is a reduction in TB miss rates. For more information on
              improving the performance of shareable images, see the
              OpenVMS Linker Utility Manual.

              The following ACMS images have been linked to allow them to
              be installed as resident:

              For all kits:

              o  SYS$LIBRARY:ACMSHR.EXE

              o  SYS$LIBRARY:ACMTWPSHR.EXE

              o  SYS$LIBRARY:ACMRRSHR.EXE

              o  SYS$LIBRARY:ACMVFSHR.EXE

              For development and run-time kits only (in addition to the
              preceding):

              o  SYS$LIBRARY:ACMIWPSHR.EXE

              o  SYS$SYSTEM:ACMSIWP.EXE

              To install images as resident, execute the ACMS startup
              command procedure with the RESIDENT parameter as follows:

              @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTART.COM RESIDENT

              On OpenVMS VAX, the RESIDENT parameter is ignored when
              specified with ACMSTART.COM.

              Installing images as resident may require that you increase
              the GBLPAGES, GBLSECTIONS, and NPAGEDYN system parameters.
              Refer to Section 2.6.3 for more information on using
              AUTOGEN to change system parameters.

                                                After Installing ACMS 4-3

 



    After Installing ACMS
    4.2 Editing System Startup and Shutdown Procedures


          For OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.x, you may need to increase
          the GH_RSRVPGCNT SYSGEN parameter to install ACMS images as
          resident.

    4.2.3 ACMSTART.COM Installs DECC$SHR and ACMS$TRACE_SHR.EXE

          ACMSHR.EXE links with ACMS$TRACE_SHR.EXE, which links with
          DECC$SHR.EXE. ACMSTART.COM has been modified to install
          both DECC$SHR.EXE and ACMS$TRACE_SHR.EXE. It is necessary
          to leave both of these images installed.

          If DECC$SHR is not installed on the system, you get an
          error similar to the following when starting ACMS:

          $ ACMS/START SYS
          %DCL-W-ACTIMAGE, error activating image DECC$SHR
              -CLI-E-IMGNAME, image file
               $100$DUA253:[SYS4.SYSCOMMON.][SYSLIB]DECC$SHR.EXE;1
              -SYSTEM-F-PRIVINSTALL, shareable images must be installed
               to run privileged image

          If ACMS$TRACE_SHR.EXE is not installed on the system, you
          get the following error when starting ACMS:

          $ ACMS/START SYS
          %DCL-W-ACTIMAGE, error activating image ACMS$TRACE_SHR.EXE
          -CLI-E-IMGNAME, image file
               $100$DUA253:[SYS4.SYSCOMMON.][SYSLIB]ACMS$TRACE_SHR.EXE
              -SYSTEM-F-PRIVINSTALL, shareable images must be installed
               to run privileged image

    4.2.4 Editing the System Shutdown Procedure

          Add the following DCL commands to the system shutdown file,
          SYS$MANAGER:SYSHUTDWN.COM:

          $ ACMS/STOP SYSTEM /CANCEL
          $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTOP.COM

          The first command cancels all active tasks and shuts down
          the ACMS system. It ensures that the ACMS system processes
          are run down properly and immediately.

          The second command invokes the ACMS shutdown command
          procedure, ACMSTOP.COM. This procedure deinstalls ACMS
          images (using the Install Utility of OpenVMS).

        4.3 Editing ACMS_SETUP.COM

              During the installation of ACMS, ACMS_SETUP.COM, a template
              for site-specific ACMS startup operations, is placed in
              SYS$STARTUP. If ACMS_SETUP.COM already existed from a
              previous installation, the template is named ACMS_SETUP_
              NEW.COM.

              The next sections describe modifications you can make to
              ACMS_SETUP.COM, based on your use of ACMS.

        4.3.1 Optional ACMS Logical Names

              Table 4-1 lists optional ACMS logical names that you can
              define in ACMS_SETUP.COM, and their defaults.

              Table_4-1_Optional_ACMS_Logical_Names______________________

              Logical_Name_____Default___________________________________

              ACMS$AUDIT_      SYS$ERRORLOG:ACMSAUDIT.LOG
              LOG[1]

              ACMS$SWL_LOG[1]  SYS$ERRORLOG:SWL.LOG

              ACMS$NOTICE[2]   (none)

              ACMS$EDIT[3]     SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]TDMSEDIT.COM

              ADU$EDIT[4]      ACMS$EDIT

              SWLUP$EDIT[5]    ACMS$EDIT
              [1]See_Compaq_ACMS_for_OpenVMS_Managing_Applications_for___

              more information on this logical name.
              [2]Used to display the text in the file pointed to by
              the logical name whenever an ACMS user signs in through
              the terminal subsystem. If defined, it must point to an
              existing, nonempty text file.
              [3]If TDMS is not installed, the default is
              SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSEDIT.COM.
              [4]Defines the editor to be used for the EDIT command to
              ACMSADU.
              [5]Defines the editor to be used for the EDIT command to
              SWLUP.
              ___________________________________________________________

              For each of these logical names, a DCL command exists in
              ACMS_SETUP.COM. For example:

              $! DFN_SUPER ACMS$AUDIT_LOG SYS$ERRORLOG:ACMSAUDIT.LOG

                                                After Installing ACMS 4-5

 



    After Installing ACMS
    4.3 Editing ACMS_SETUP.COM


          (DFN_SUPER is also defined in ACMS_SETUP.COM, to create
          the logical name in the mode required by ACMS.) To equate
          an optional ACMS logical to a nondefault value, edit the
          appropriate command line by removing the exclamation point
          (!) and providing a new equivalence string for the logical
          name. For example:

          $ DFN_SUPER ACMS$AUDIT_LOG AUDIT_DISK:ACMSAUDIT.LOG

    4.3.2 Installing Application Development Shareable Images

          If you have installed the development kit, or the run-time
          kit with CDD installed, the shareable images listed in
          Table 4-2 and Table 4-3 are in SYS$SHARE. If you installed
          the remote-access kit, or the run-time kit without CDD
          installed, these images are not supplied.

          If you do a lot of ACMS application development work,
          consider installing these shareable images. Installing
          these images increases the number of global sections
          and global pages required by ACMS, but decreases memory
          requirements if many users are running ADU, and also
          decreases image activation time. Table 4-2 and Table 4-3
          show the number of global sections and global pages
          required for installing each image.

              ACMTDUSHR________1________________299______________________

              For each of these images, the following DCL commands exist
              in ACMS_SETUP.COM:

              $! IMAGE_NAME = "image"
              $! GOSUB INSTALL_IMAGE

              To install these images during the next ACMS startup, edit
              the command lines by removing the exclamation point (!) in
              each line.

        4.3.3 ACMS System Management Commands

              ACMS_SETUP.COM can also be used to execute ACMS system
              management commands that prepare the ACMS system for
              work. These commands might include starting applications,
              enabling ACMS operator terminals, starting the Queued Task
              Initiator (QTI), and so forth.

              Examples of these commands are included at the end of ACMS_
              SETUP.COM:

          Edit this section of ACMS_SETUP.COM by inserting the
          commands necessary to complete the startup of your ACMS
          system.

    4.4 Modifying ACMS Parameters

          After installing ACMS, run the ACMSPARAM.COM and
          ACMEXCPAR.COM command procedures to determine ACMS quotas,
          parameters, and privileges. There is no need to run
          ACMEXCPAR.COM after a new installation until applications
          have been installed.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Compaq strongly recommends that you use ACMSPARAM.COM
             and ACMEXCPAR.COM. Otherwise, you might not be able to
             start ACMS.

             ______________________________________________________

          These command procedures perform the following tasks:

          o  Calculate the minimum settings for the OpenVMS SYSGEN
             parameters that ACMS affects.

              o  Assign privileges and quotas required for user names
                 under which the ACMS run-time processes run.

              o  Assign privileges and quotas required for user names
                 under which applications run.

              ACMSPARAM.COM and ACMEXCPAR.COM do not support logical name
              search lists for the TDB file specifications.

              Refer to Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS Managing Applications
              for information on how to use the ACMSPARAM and ACMEXCPAR
              command procedures.

              Certain conditions require attention to adjust ACMS
              parameter values:

              o  ACMSPARAM.COM might generate an excessive PGFLQUOTA
                 value for the CP account.

                 The current formula for calculating the PGFLQUOTA value
                 of the CP account is liberal. The formula assumes that
                 each exchange step involves the sending or receiving
                 of the largest message. (See the description of the
                 LARGEST_MESSAGE variable in Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS
                 Managing Applications.)

                 After executing ACMSPARAM.COM, review the value of
                 CP_PGFLQUOTA. If its value appears to be excessively
                 large, then replace the LARGEST_MESSAGE variable with
                 the average size of workspaces used in exchange steps,
                 or with the size of the workspace most often used in
                 exchange steps.

                 The formula for calculating the CP_PGFLQUOTA provides
                 only a rough approximation of the quota. To fine-tune
                 your system, calculate the quota for your particular
                 system.

              o  ACMS operator commands may fail with the INVACMPAR
                 error.

                 During a new installation of ACMS, the installation
                 procedure resets the ACMSGEN parameters to their
                 default values. If the value of the SYSGEN parameter
                 MAXPROCESSCNT is too large, the default size of MSS_
                 POOLSIZE can be too low to allow ACMS to start. The
                 following error is reported when any ACMS operator
                 command is entered:

             -ACMSMSS-E-INVACMPAR, The system MSS parameters are invalid

             Enter the following commands to reset MSS_POOLSIZE - you
             might need to set MSS_POOLSIZE to be larger, depending
             on the value of MAXPROCESSCNT:

             $ MCR ACMSGEN
             USE CURRENT
             SET MSS_POOLSIZE 1024
             WRITE CURRENT

    4.5 Authorizing Applications, Devices, Users, and Processes

          ACMS provides utilities to specify which applications,
          terminals, users, and agent programs can access the ACMS
          system. The following sections describe these utilities.

    4.5.1 Authorizing New Applications

          Run the ACMS Application Authorization Utility (AAU)
          to authorize any new ACMS applications that you plan to
          install. AAU allows you to authorize applications, specify
          application user name restrictions, and define who can
          install those applications. You must restart ACMS after
          installing any new applications.

          Users who have been authorized by AAU can use the
          ACMS/INSTALL operator command to install applications in
          ACMS$DIRECTORY. By default, no users are authorized to use
          the ACMS/INSTALL operator command.

          Use of AAU is optional; however, it can simplify and ease
          the application management process during the development
          and maintenance of applications.

          For information on using AAU, see Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS
          Managing Applications.

    4.5.2 Authorizing New Terminals

          If you have new terminals to authorize or modify, run the
          Device Definition Utility (DDU) to authorize either all
          terminals (with $ALL) or individual terminals (by device
          name) for access to ACMS:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
              $ RUN ACMSDDU
              DDU> ADD $ALL
              DDU> EXIT

              For information on using DDU, see Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS
              Managing Applications.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Users on your system cannot sign in to ACMS until you
                authorize $ALL or specific terminals.

                ______________________________________________________

        4.5.3 Authorizing New Users

              If you have new users to authorize, run the ACMS User
              Definition Utility (UDU) to authorize ACMS users. You can
              either authorize all users (with $ALL) or individual users
              (by name):

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
              $ RUN ACMSUDU
              UDU> ADD $ALL
              UDU> EXIT

              For information on using UDU, see Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS
              Managing Applications.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Users on your system cannot sign in to ACMS until you
                authorize $ALL or specific user names.

                ______________________________________________________

        4.5.4 Authorizing ACMS Processes

              You must authorize the user name of any task-submitting
              agent program that submits a task for processing with a
              user name other than the user name of that agent. Use the
              /AGENT qualifier with the UDU ADD command to authorize this
              type of agent. For example, use the following command to
              authorize an agent with the user name SYSTEM:

          User SYSTEM  has been added to the database

          Both the ACMS Command Process (CP) and the Queued Task
          Initiator (QTI) must be authorized as agents. By default,
          ACMS assigns the user name SYSTEM to the CP and QTI. If
          you change the user name of the CP or QTI with ACMSGEN, you
          must run the UDU again, using the RENAME command to change
          the user name in the UDU authorization file.

          For information on UDU, see Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS
          Managing Applications.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The ACMSPARAM.COM procedure automatically authorizes
                the user names of the CP and QTI as agents (using the
                /AGENT qualifier) in the ACMS user authorization file
                ACMSUDF.DAT. The ACMSPARAM command procedure takes
                either the user name you supply or supplies a default
                user name. The default user name supplied for the CP
                is ACMS$CP. The default user name supplied for the QTI
                is ACMS$QTI.

                ______________________________________________________

        4.6 Creating and Modifying ACMS User Accounts

              Each person who uses ACMS on your system must be an
              authorized OpenVMS user, with certain privileges and
              quotas. The following sections describe these requirements.
              (See Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS Managing Applications for
              quotas required for users running the ACMS Task Debugger.)

        4.6.1 Privileges

              To use ACMS, each user account must have at least TMPMBX
              and NETMBX privileges. Those persons who are responsible
              for starting the ACMS system, starting applications, and
              using other ACMS operator commands must have OpenVMS OPER
              privilege. Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility to determine
              whether users have the privileges they require.

        4.6.2 Quotas

              Make sure that the appropriate user accounts have
              sufficient quotas to be able to use ACMS. Table 4-4
              summarizes the required user account quotas.

          User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT. Use
          the Authorize Utility to verify and change user account
          quotas. First set your directory to SYS$SYSTEM and then run
          AUTHORIZE:

          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
          $ RUN AUTHORIZE
          UAF>

          At the AUTHORIZE prompt (UAF>), enter the SHOW command with
          an account name to check a particular account. For example:

          UAF> SHOW SMITH

          To change a quota, enter the MODIFY command at the UAF>
          prompt. The MODIFY command has the following format:

          MODIFY account-name/quota-name=nnnn

          The following example changes the FILLM quota for the SMITH
          account and then exits from the utility:

          UAF> MODIFY SMITH/FILLM=50
          UAF> EXIT

          After you exit from the utility, the OpenVMS system
          displays messages indicating whether or not changes were
          made. Once you have finished making the changes, the users
          must log out and log in again for the new quotas to take
          effect.

                            4.6 Creating and Modifying ACMS User Accounts


              For more information on modifying account quotas, see
              the description of the Authorize Utility in the OpenVMS
              documentation on system management and operations.

        4.7 Setting up ACMS on an OpenVMS Cluster System

              Because ACMS treats an OpenVMS Cluster system as if it
              were a local area network, you must perform the following
              operations on each node of the cluster:

              o  Define proxy accounts for users on other nodes of the
                 cluster.

                 ACMS does not recognize the common security domain of
                 a homogeneous OpenVMS Cluster system. As a consequence,
                 you must define proxy accounts on each node for users
                 on other nodes of the cluster. You can use ACMSGEN to
                 assign a default proxy user name (with the USERNAME_
                 DEFAULT parameter of ACMSGEN), or use the ACMSUDU
                 utility to define individual ACMS proxy user names for
                 submitters. Refer to Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS Managing
                 Applications for more information on using ACMSUDU to
                 create submitter proxies.

              o  Issue a LICENSE LOAD command on each node that will run
                 ACMS.

                 If you are installing ACMS in a cluster, you must load
                 the ACMS license on each node that will use the product.
                 For example:

                 $ LICENSE LOAD ACMS

              o  Replace the DCL tables on each node. For example:

                 $ INSTALL REPLACE SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES

              o  Execute ACMS startup procedure on each node that will
                 run ACMS. For example:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACMSSTART.COM

              o  Set up node-specific ACMSPAR.ACM files.

                 If you are installing ACMS in a cluster, you must
                 make sure that the ACMSPAR.ACM parameter file is
                 in the directory SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSEXE], rather than
                 SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE] before setting the NODE_NAME
                 parameter. Do this on each node of the cluster,
                 because each node has a different DECnet node name

    After Installing ACMS
    4.7 Setting up ACMS on an OpenVMS Cluster System


             and, therefore, each must have its own node-specific
             ACMSPAR.ACM file. See Section 4.8 for more information
             on setting the NODE_NAME parameter.

    4.8 Enabling Distributed ACMS Processing

          By default, ACMS does not enable distributed processing.
          If submitters on your node need to select tasks in a remote
          application, or if remote submitters need to select tasks
          in an application on your node, you must set the NODE_
          NAME parameter in ACMSGEN to your node name. (This step is
          usually necessary only for new installations, not system
          upgrades.) For example:

          $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:ACMSGEN
          ACMSGEN> SET NODE_NAME DOVE
          ACMSGEN> WRITE SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSEXE]ACMSPAR.ACM

          For more information about using ACMSGEN and ACMS
          distributed processing, see Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS
          Managing Applications.

    4.9 Rebuilding the LSE Environment

          If the DECtp Implementation Toolkit for OpenVMS is
          installed on your system, you must rebuild the toolkit's
          LSE environment and section files after installing ACMS
          Version 4.4. See the toolkit documentation for instructions
          on how to rebuild the LSE environment.

    4.10 Installing ACMS Menu Form Files

          If you have customized the ACMS menu form definition file,
          you must rebuild the form image file. Use the following DCL
          command file to rebuild and install the new form image file
          on the system:

          $  @SYS$MANAGER:ACMS_BUILD_MENU_FORM.COM

    4.11 Preparing Language-Specific ACMS Development Environments

          The following sections describe how to set up an
          environment for developing ACMS agents in BLISS or Pascal.

           4.11 Preparing Language-Specific ACMS Development Environments


        4.11.1 BLISS Agents

              ACMS Version 4.4 supplies the ACMSBLI.R32 file. If you plan
              to use BLISS agents, see the BLISS-32 documentation for
              directions on building the BLISS library file (ACMSBLI.L32)
              from the ACMSBLI.R32 file, and for general information on
              creating library files, and using library files and require
              files.

              ACMSBLI.R32 contains the following:

              o  Keyword macros for all the services. The macro name
                 is the service name prefixed with a dollar sign ($).
                 The keyword macro for ACMS$SIGN_IN, for example, is
                 $ACMS$SIGN_IN.

              o  Structure definitions for all IDs. The name of the
                 structure is the same as the name given in the structure
                 layouts listed in Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS Systems
                 Interface Programming. Use these IDs in declaration
                 definitions.

              o  Miscellaneous symbolic constants used in service call
                 arguments.

        4.11.2 Pascal Agents

              ACMS Version 4.4 supplies the ACMSPAS.PAS file. If you
              plan to use Pascal agents, you must compile this file into
              an environment file. See the VAX Pascal documentation for
              directions on building the environment file (.PEN) from the
              ACMSPAS.PAS file, and on using environment definitions.

              ACMSPAS.PAS contains the following:

              o  Routine definitions for all the services.

              o  Record definitions for all IDs. The name of the record
                 is the same as the name given in the structure list
                 in the Compaq ACMS for OpenVMS Systems Interface
                 Programming. Use these IDs in declarations.

              o  Miscellaneous symbolic constants used in service call
                 arguments.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

          any changes to the system in your system management log.
          If an error occurs while ACMS is being used and you believe
          that the error is caused by a problem with ACMS, contact a
          Compaq Customer Support Center to report the problem.

                                                     Running the ACMS IVP


              This chapter describes how to run the ACMS software
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) separately
              from the installation procedure. The IVP checks that the
              installation procedure has successfully installed the ACMS
              software, and that the software can create and run ACMS
              applications.

              The IVP can be run as a part of the normal installation.
              However, if the automatic IVP fails for any reason, correct
              the error and then run the IVP again.

              You can also execute the IVP to verify that ACMS is
              functioning properly after your system environment has
              changed; for example, after you have installed or upgraded
              another layered product that ACMS uses, such as DECforms or
              Rdb.

        5.1 Functions of the IVP

              Table 5-1 lists the tests performed by the ACMS IVP.
              The full set of tests is performed if you installed the
              development kit; subsets are performed for the run-time
              kit with CDD, the run-time kit without CDD, and the remote-
              access kit.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If disk quotas are enabled, the IVP fails. The
                installation procedure checks to see if disk
                quotas are enabled. If disk quotas are enabled,
                the installation procedure displays an informational
                message to that effect and continues. See Section 2.5
                for more information on disk quotas.

    system. CDD uses DECdtm, and, therefore, that portion of the IVP
    that builds the IVP task group and application is subject to the
    requirements of CDD and DECdtm. If you are installing the ACMS
    Remote-Access kit or the ACMS Run-Time kit without CDD, this
    error cannot occur. If the IVP fails, refer to Appendix D for
    directions on how to create a transaction log.
    _________________________________________________________________

    5.2 Running the IVP

          To run the IVP independently of the installation procedure,
          follow these steps:

          1. Log in to the system manager's account, SYSTEM:

                 Username:  SYSTEM
                 Password:

              2. Shut down ACMS.

                 You cannot run the IVP if ACMS is active on your system.
                 To shut down ACMS, enter the following command at the
                 DCL prompt:

                 $ ACMS/STOP SYSTEM/CANCEL

              3. Set your default to SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSTEST.ACMS]:

                 $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSTEST.ACMS]

              4. Run the ACMS Installation Verification Procedure,
                 ACMSIVP.COM.

                 To start the IVP, enter the following command:

                 $ @ACMSIVP

              The IVP checks for the presence of the user account
              ACMS$IVP. If the account does not exist, the IVP asks
              you for a user identification code (UIC) and password so
              that it can create the account. Refer to Section 2.9 and
              Section 3.2.2 for more information on creating the ACMS$IVP
              account.

              Section 2.8 contains information on the time necessary to
              execute the IVP.

        5.3 Errors Running the IVP

              When the IVP is run automatically during the installation
              of ACMS, all output from the IVP is logged in
              SYS$UPDATE:ACMSIVP.LOG. When the IVP is run manually, all
              output is displayed on the terminal.

              If the IVP detects an error, it provides an appropriate
              error message. This message includes a suggested action,
              such as stopping the ACMS system and reinvoking the IVP.
              If the suggested action does not fix the problem, reinstall
              ACMS.

    5.3 Errors Running the IVP


          IVP Can Fail with INVACMPAR Error When MSS_POOLSIZE Is Too
          Low

          When you run the IVP, it resets all the ACMSGEN parameters
          to their default values. If the value of the SYSGEN
          parameter MAXPROCESSNT is too large, the default size of
          MSS_POOLSIZE can be too low to allow ACMS to start. The
          following error is reported when any ACMS operator command
          is entered:

          -ACMSMSS-E-INVACMPAR, The system MSS parameters are invalid

          To run the IVP, include the following in the ACMSIVP.COM
          file, which is located in the subdirectory [.ACMS] under
          SYS$TEST - you might need to set the value of MSS_POOLSIZE
          to be larger, depending on the value of MAXPROCESSCNT:

          $ MCR ACMSGEN
          USE DEFAULT
          SET MSS_POOLSIZE 1024
          SET ACC_USERNAME ACMS$IVP
             .
             .
             .

                                                        Deinstalling ACMS


              This chapter describes the process of deinstalling ACMS.

                _______________________ Caution _______________________

                The deinstallation of ACMS removes all ACMS files from
                your system, including customer-written applications
                in ACMS$DIRECTORY.

                ______________________________________________________

              Deinstallation is necessary only if you no longer need ACMS
              on your system and you want to release the disk space for
              other use.

              Deinstallation is not necessary if you are upgrading to a
              new version of ACMS. When you upgrade, obsolete ACMS files
              are deleted and superseded files are purged automatically
              by the installation procedure.

        6.1 Starting the Deinstallation Procedure

              To invoke the ACMS deinstallation procedure, execute the
              following command:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:ACMS_DEINSTALL.COM

              The deinstallation procedure asks if you want to continue.
              The default answer is NO; you must answer YES <Return> to
              continue.

              The deinstallation procedure then does the following:

              1. Stops the ACMS system.

              2. Deinstalls all ACMS installed images.

              3. Deletes all files and directories known to be created by
                 the ACMS installation.

    Deinstalling ACMS
    6.1 Starting the Deinstallation Procedure


          4. Checks the system disk for any other files that might be
             related to ACMS.

          If files are found that might be related to ACMS, the
          deinstallation procedure lists them on your terminal. You
          can review any files listed in this manner and delete them
          manually, or you can reinvoke the deinstallation procedure
          to delete them automatically. Execute the following command
          to delete these files automatically:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:ACMS_DEINSTALL.COM DELETE_SUSPECTED_ACMS_FILES

    6.2 Completing the Deinstallation

          The ACMS deinstallation procedure removes all files
          related to ACMS from the system. However, to complete the
          deinstallation of ACMS, you might also want to perform some
          or all of the following cleanup steps:

          o  Deassign all ACMS logical names (on each node if in an
             OpenVMS Cluster environment).

          o  Delete the ACMS$IVP account from the SYSUAF database.

          o  Remove any OpenVMS proxies granted to former users of
             ACMS who no longer need access to the system.

          o  Delete the ACMS deinstallation command procedure by
             executing the following command:

             $ DELETE SYS$UPDATE:ACMS_DEINSTALL.COM;*

              Checking/creating logical ACMS$DIRECTORY
              ----------------------------------------

                The procedure checks for the logical ACMS$DIRECTORY, which must be defined
                /SYSTEM /SUPERVISOR and must point to an existing disk directory.

                  ACMS$DIRECTORY is defined as SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ACMS.ADB]
                  SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ACMS.ADB] does not exist

              Do you want to create it [Y]?

                  Created directory SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ACMS.ADB]

                  ACMS$DIRECTORY is defined as SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ACMS.ADB]
                  ACMS$DIRECTORY logical is acceptable

    Sample Installations
    A.1 OpenVMS Alpha Development Kit Sample Installation


            This procedure searches for all ACMSGEN parameter files located in
            SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS*.SYSEXE] and SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE], and converts
            them to be compatible with the current version of ACMS. If you are
            upgrading from a version of ACMS prior to V4.0, you must perform
            this conversion.

          Do you want to convert existing ACMSGEN parameter files [Y]?

              Converting SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSPAR.ACM

              The ACMSGEN parameter files listed above have been converted; if other
              parameter files exist on your system, they must be updated as follows:

                  $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:ACMSGEN
                  ACMSGEN> USE file-specification
                  ACMSGEN> WRITE file-specification
                  ACMSGEN> EXIT

                                   (press <RETURN> to continue)

          Converting ACMS UDF and DDF files
          ---------------------------------

            The procedure searches for the files pointed to by the ACMSUDF and ACMSDDF
            logicals, if they exist, and then for AMCSUDF.DAT or ACMSDDF.DAT in
            SYS$SYSROOT:[SYS*], and converts them to be compatible with the current
            version of ACMS. If you are upgrading from a version of ACMS prior to V3.1,
            you must perform this conversion.

          Do you want to convert existing ACMS UDF and DDF files [Y]?

              No files found to convert

                                   (press <RETURN> to continue)

          Checking/creating ACMS UDF and DDF files
          ----------------------------------------

            The procedure checks for ACMSUDF.DAT and ACMSDDF.DAT, first through the
            logicals ACMSUDF and ACMSDDF, and then in SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE], and
            creates them if they're not already present from a previous installation.

              No /SYSTEM /EXECUTIVE logical ACMSUDF found
              SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSUDF.DAT not found
              Creating SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSUDF.DAT

              No /SYSTEM /EXECUTIVE logical ACMSDDF found

              Checking/creating ACMS_SETUP.COM
              --------------------------------

                The procedure checks for site-specific startup procedure ACMS_SETUP.COM in
                SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP], and creates a template if the file doesn't
                already exist.

                  Creating SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]ACMS_SETUP.COM

                ACMS_SETUP.COM will be executed the next time you invoke
                SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTART.COM. Please review ACMS_SETUP.COM and adjust it to
                reflect the needs of your ACMS environment. It can be used to perform
                these site-specific startup steps:
                  - define the ACMS logical ACMS$DIRECTORY
                  - install ACMS utilities as shareable images
                  - define ACMS logicals such as ACMS$AUDIT_LOG, ACMS$SWL_LOG,
                    ACMS$NOTICE, ACMS$EDIT, ADU$EDIT and SWLUP$EDIT
                  - start the ACMS system and applications

                                       (press <RETURN> to continue)

              Checking/copying ACMS menu files
              --------------------------------

                The procedure checks for the ACMS command menu and default user menu in
                ACMS$DIRECTORY, and copies them from SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE] if they're not
                already in ACMS$DIRECTORY from a previous installation.

                    AMAMA$DKA500:[SYS0.SYSEXE]SYSUAF.DAT

                  The files listed above, found in system-specific roots, may have an adverse
                  effect in the installation of ACMS, execution of the IVP, or subsequent
                  execution of applications. If you encounter problems during or after the
                  installation, Compaq advises you to review the list and delete or rename
                  these files, or move them to cluster-common directories, and then reinstall
                  ACMS. The list of files is also recorded in
                  SYS$COMMON:[SYSUPD]ACMS044_INSTALLATION.LOG.

          SUMMARY OF THIS ACMS INSTALLATION
          ---------------------------------

              The following steps will be taken to complete this installation:

              o  The ACMS system will be shut down (via SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTOP.COM)
              o  ACMS component software will be installed
              o  LSE environment will be updated for ACMS
              o  Oracle Trace facility text library will be updated for ACMS
              o  CDD-related ACMS files will be installed
              o  ACMS samples will be installed
              o  ACMS Request Interface samples will be installed
              o  The ACMS postinstallation procedure will be executed
              o  The ACMS IVP will be executed

              The rest of the installation will take approximately 15 minutes.
              Execution of the IVP will take approximately 3 minutes.

              Note that this time is heavily dependent your system load, hardware
              and kit media. The time mentioned was measured on a stand-alone VAX 8530
              system with a disk-resident kit.  Your time may vary.

          * Do you want to continue the installation [YES]?

          The interactive portion of this installation is complete; no further questions
          will be asked until the post installation.

          Checking/creating logical ACMS$DIRECTORY
          ----------------------------------------

            The procedure checks for the logical ACMS$DIRECTORY, which must be defined
            /SYSTEM /SUPERVISOR and must point to an existing disk directory.

              ACMS$DIRECTORY is not defined as a /SYSTEM /SUPERVISOR logical

              Converting ACMSGEN parameter files
              ----------------------------------

                This procedure searches for all ACMSGEN parameter files located in
                SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS*.SYSEXE] and SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE], and converts
                them to be compatible with the current version of ACMS. If you are
                upgrading from a version of ACMS prior to V4.0, you must perform
                this conversion.

              Do you want to convert existing ACMSGEN parameter files [Y]?

                  Converting SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS0.SYSEXE]ACITVE.ACM
                  Converting SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSPAR.ACM

                  The ACMSGEN parameter files listed above have been converted; if other
                  parameter files exist on your system, they must be updated as follows:

                      $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:ACMSGEN
                      ACMSGEN> USE file-specification
                      ACMSGEN> WRITE file-specification
                      ACMSGEN> EXIT

                                       (press <RETURN> to continue)

              Converting ACMS UDF and DDF files
              ---------------------------------

                The procedure searches for the files pointed to by the ACMSUDF and ACMSDDF
                logicals, if they exist, and then for AMCSUDF.DAT or ACMSDDF.DAT in
                SYS$SYSROOT:[SYS*], and converts them to be compatible with the current
                version of ACMS. If you are upgrading from a version of ACMS prior to V3.1,
                you must perform this conversion.

              Do you want to convert existing ACMS UDF and DDF files [Y]?

                  Converting UDF file SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSUDF.DAT
                  Converting DDF file SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSDDF.DAT

              Checking/creating ACMS UDF and DDF files
              ----------------------------------------

                The procedure checks for ACMSUDF.DAT and ACMSDDF.DAT, first through the
                logicals ACMSUDF and ACMSDDF, and then in SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE], and
                creates them if they're not already present from a previous installation.

                  No /SYSTEM /EXECUTIVE logical ACMSUDF found
                  SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]ACMSUDF.DAT exists

          Checking/creating ACMS_SETUP.COM
          --------------------------------

            The procedure checks for site-specific startup procedure ACMS_SETUP.COM in
            SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP], and creates a template if the file doesn't
            already exist.

              Creating SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]ACMS_SETUP.COM

            ACMS_SETUP.COM will be executed the next time you invoke
            SYS$STARTUP:ACMSTART.COM. Please review ACMS_SETUP.COM and adjust it to
            reflect the needs of your ACMS environment. It can be used to perform
            these site-specific startup steps:
              - define the ACMS logical ACMS$DIRECTORY
              - install ACMS utilities as shareable images
              - define ACMS logicals such as ACMS$AUDIT_LOG, ACMS$SWL_LOG,
                ACMS$NOTICE, ACMS$EDIT, ADU$EDIT and SWLUP$EDIT
              - start the ACMS system and applications

          Checking/copying ACMS menu files
          --------------------------------

            The procedure checks for the ACMS command menu and default user menu in
            ACMS$DIRECTORY, and copies them from SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE] if they're not
            already in ACMS$DIRECTORY from a previous installation.

                                Registering and Loading Your ACMS License


              You must register and load your ACMS license before you can
              install or use ACMS. This appendix explains how to register
              and load your license.

              Section B.1 describes an ACMS License Product Authorization
              Key (PAK).

              Section B.2 describes how to load and register your ACMS
              license using the command procedure VMSLICENSE.COM.

              Section B.3 describes how to load and register your ACMS
              license using the LICENSE DCL commands.

              For more information on OpenVMS licensing, see OpenVMS
              License Management Utility Manual, and the DCL command HELP
              LICENSE.

        B.1 Sample ACMS License PAK

              The ACMS License PAK is a paper document that contains
              information about your ACMS license. When you register your
              ACMS license on your system, information from this document
              is loaded into the license database.

              Each PAK has fourteen fields of information. Depending on
              your license agreement, some fields might contain data,
              while others might be blank.

              Table B-1 lists all the fields on a PAK, along with typical
              data for an ACMS PAK.

    B.2 Using VMSLICENSE.COM

          You can register and load your ACMS license using the
          OpenVMS command procedure VMSLICENSE.COM. To invoke this
          procedure, first log in to the system manager's account,
          SYSTEM, and then execute the following command:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE

          The procedure displays a menu; press <Return> to choose the
          default menu item, registering a PAK. The procedure then
          asks if you have your PAK; press <Return> to choose the
          default answer, YES.

          The procedure now asks you to supply the data for each
          field on your PAK. For each field, type in the data exactly
          as it appears on the PAK.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                A PAK cannot have both a version and a product
                release date. If you provide version information,
                the procedure does not ask for a product release date.

                ______________________________________________________

              When you have supplied all the PAK information, the
              procedure displays the information you provided, in the
              same form as it appears on the PAK, and asks if it is
              correct. If all the information is correct, press <Return>
              to choose the default answer, YES.

              The procedure then registers the PAK in the license
              database, and asks if you want to load the license. Press
              <Return> to choose the default answer, YES.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The license must be registered and loaded on your
                system before you can install and use ACMS.

                ______________________________________________________

              When you are finished, select menu item 99 to exit from the
              procedure.

        B.3 Using LICENSE DCL Commands

              You can register and load your ACMS license using the DCL
              commands LICENSE REGISTER and LICENSE LOAD. Log in to the
              system manager's account, SYSTEM, before executing these
              commands.

              The LICENSE REGISTER command accepts parameters and
              qualifiers that correspond to the fields on your PAK. The
              general syntax for this command is:

              LICENSE REGISTER product-name [/qualifiers]

              Table B-2 lists all the fields on a PAK, along with their
              LICENSE LOAD parameters and qualifiers.

                                     Modifying ACMS Help and Message Text


              This appendix describes how to modify ACMS help and message
              text, for example, to translate them to languages other
              than English.

              The ACMS kit includes a save set that contains the files
              you can use to translate the contents of ACMS message files
              and help text to languages other than English. This section
              provides information on how to restore the save set from
              the kit.

              All source files for the messages and help text are stored
              in a BACKUP save set in the kit. Restore this save set to a
              directory and modify it there. Follow these instructions to
              restore the save set:

              1. Mount the kit.

                 If the kit is on disk, mount it using the /OVERRIDE=ID
                 qualifier. For example, to mount a kit on RA90 drive
                 $100$DUA31:, use the following command:

                 $ MOUNT/OVERRIDE=ID $100$DUA31:

              2. Restore the save set.

                 To restore the save set, use the DCL command BACKUP and
                 the save set name in the following format:

                 BACKUP/LOG kit-device:<kit-name>.I /SAVE
        disk:[directory]

                 The <kit-name> parameter denotes the software kit you
                 are installing:

                 o  ACMSDEVA_044 - if you are installing the Alpha
                    development kit.

                 o  ACMSRTOA_044 - if you are installing the Alpha run-
                    time kit.

    Modifying ACMS Help and Message Text



             o  ACMSREMA_044 - if you are installing the Alpha
                remote-access kit.

             o  ACMSDEVV_044 - if you are installing the VAX
                development kit.

             o  ACMSRTOV_044 - if you are installing the VAX run-time
                kit.

             o  ACMSREMV_044 - if you are installing the VAX remote-
                access kit.

             Restore the save set to an empty directory. For example,
             if you have an ACMS Alpha development kit that is
             mounted on DKA1: and you have created the directory
             DISK1:[MESSAGES] to hold the files, use the following
             DCL command BACKUP to restore the save set:

             $ BACKUP/LOG DKA1:ACMSDEVA_044.I/SAVESET DISK1:[MESSAGES]

             The ACMS save sets are stored in the [0,0] directory
             on disk kits. If, for example, you have an ACMS Alpha
             run-time kit that is mounted on $100$DUA31:, and you
             have created the directory DISK1:[MESSAGES] to hold the
             files, use the following DCL BACKUP command to restore
             the save set:

             $ BACKUP/LOG $100$DUA31:[0,0]ACMSRTOA_044.I/SAVESET -
             _$ DISK1:[MESSAGES]*

          3. Make changes to the files.

             After restoring the kit, you can print the file
             CHANGING_MESSAGES.MEM, which contains instructions on
             how to change the help text files, change the message
             files, and install the modified files on the target
             system. This file also includes instructions to change
             the character ordering sequence used by the CONTROL
             FIELD and SELECT FIRST statements.

                            Creating Transaction Logs for DECdtm Services


              If you want to use DECdtm services on a node, you must
              create a transaction log for that node. In an OpenVMS
              Cluster system, you must create a transaction log for each
              node in the cluster. This appendix describes the following:

              o  Prerequisites for creating a transaction log

              o  Planning the size and location of transaction logs

              o  Setting up and creating transaction logs

              o  Example of creating transaction logs for a cluster

              For more information about DECdtm services and the commands
              described in this appendix, see the OpenVMS documentation
              set.

        D.1 Prerequisites for Creating a Transaction Log

              Before you create a transaction log for a node, the
              following prerequisites must be met:

              o  You must have the SYSPRV privilege.

              o  The node must be running OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2 or
                 higher, excluding Version 7.0.

              o  The node must be running OpenVMS VAX Version 6.2 or
                 higher, excluding Version 7.0.

        D.2 Planning the Size and Location of Transaction Logs

              The size and location of transaction logs can affect the
              performance of your system. Before you create transaction
              logs, plan how big to make the logs, and where you
              are going to put them. Although you can later move a
              transaction log and change the size to improve performance,
              careful planning reduces the need for changes.

    D.2 Planning the Size and Location of Transaction Logs


          If the performance of your system is adversely affected
          by either the location or size of the logs, refer to the
          OpenVMS documentation for the following information:

          o  Checking whether or not the transaction logs are the
             correct size

          o  Changing the size of transaction logs

          o  Moving transaction logs

    D.2.1 Determining the Size of Transaction Logs

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             These guidelines for determining the size of a
             transaction log are approximate. When planning
             transaction logs, overestimate, rather than
             underestimate, the size of the transaction log.

             ______________________________________________________

          When you create transaction logs, you specify the size of
          the log in blocks. By default, the size of each transaction
          log is 4000 blocks. This default size gives acceptable
          performance on most systems.

          If you know the rate of transactions and their duration,
          use the following algorithm to calculate the transaction
          log size:

          size = 40 * rate * duration

          In this algorithm:

          o  size is the size (in blocks) of the transaction log.

          o  rate is the average number of transactions executed per
             second.

          o  duration is the average duration (in seconds) of each
             transaction.

          For example, if the rate is 10 transactions per second and
          the duration is 12 seconds, the calculation is as follows:

          size = 40 * 10 * 12 = 4800 blocks

          In this example, the recommended size for the transaction
          log is 4800 blocks.

                   D.2 Planning the Size and Location of Transaction Logs


              If you do not know the rate and duration of transactions,
              accept the default value of 4000 blocks.

        D.2.2 Determining the Location for Transaction Logs

              When deciding where to put the transaction log for a node,
              consider the following factors:

              o  Speed

                 Select a high performance disk, such as a solid state
                 disk, that is not heavily used.

              o  Availability

                 High availability is achieved when you have multiple
                 access paths to the data. Use a disk that can be
                 accessed by the other nodes in the cluster when the node
                 is down. This reduces the time that other transactions
                 in the cluster are blocked while waiting for recovery
                 from the node failure.

              o  Reliability

                 Reliability is achieved when you have multiple copies
                 of the data. A shadowed disk is more reliable than a
                 nonshadowed disk, but may be slower than a nonshadowed
                 disk because transaction logs are almost exclusively
                 write-only.

              You may have to choose which of these factors are most
              important. For example, if the node is a workstation,
              you may choose to give up speed for availability and
              reliability, by putting the transaction log on a shadowed
              HSC-based disk, instead of on a faster disk attached to the
              workstation.

              If you have an OpenVMS Cluster, each node must have its
              own transaction log. To improve the performance of the
              transactions, distribute the logs among different disks on
              the system.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Ensure that the disk has sufficient contiguous
                space to hold the transaction log. A discontiguous
                transaction log results in poor transaction
                performance.

    D.3 Setting Up and Creating Transaction Logs

          This section describes how to set up and create transaction
          logs. Before creating a transaction log, consider the
          recommendations for sizing and locating the log, as
          described in Section D.2. For an example of how to set
          up and create transaction logs for a three-node OpenVMS
          Cluster, refer to Section D.4.

          To set up and create a transaction log:

          1. Identify the directories where you want to put the
             transaction logs.

          2. Create the log file in the directories.

    D.3.1 Setting Up the Transaction Logs

          DECdtm services uses the logical SYS$JOURNAL to locate
          transaction logs. For a single node, you must define
          SYS$JOURNAL to point to the directory that will contain
          the transaction log. In an OpenVMS Cluster, you define
          SYS$JOURNAL on each node as a search list that points to
          all the directories that will contain the transaction logs
          for the cluster. If you put transaction logs for all nodes
          in one directory, SYS$JOURNAL on each node points to that
          directory.

          You must define SYS$JOURNAL in the system logical name
          table, in executive mode.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Remember to define SYS$JOURNAL in both the
             common and node-specific versions of the
             SYS$STARTUP:SYLOGICALS.COM command procedure.

                             D.3 Setting Up and Creating Transaction Logs


        D.3.2 Creating the Transaction Logs

              To create a transaction log file, use the CREATE LOGFILE
              command of the Log Manager Control Program (LMCP) Utility:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:LMCP
              LMCP>  CREATE LOGFILE file-spec /SIZE=size
              LMCP>  EXIT

              In this example:

              o  file-spec is the full file specification of the
                 transaction log. The name of the file must be
                 SYSTEM$node-name, where node-name is the name of the
                 node. The file extension must be .LM$JOURNAL. If you
                 omit the file extension in the command line, the file
                 specification has the extension .LM$JOURNAL by default.

              o  size is the size of the transaction log in blocks. If
                 you omit the /SIZE qualifier, the transaction log is
                 created with the default size of 4000 blocks.

        D.4 Example of Setting Up and Creating Transaction Logs

              This section shows you how to set up and create transaction
              logs for a three-node OpenVMS Cluster system. In this
              example, cluster members and transaction log details are
              listed in Table D-1.

              Table_D-1_Transaction_Log_Requirements_____________________

                            _______________Transaction_Log_______________

              Node_Name_____Location___________________Size_(In_Blocks)__

              ORANGE        DISK$USER1:[LOGFILES]      5000

              RED           DISK$USER3:[LOGFILES]      4000

              GREEN_________DISK$LOG:[LOGFILES]________6000______________

              To set up and create the transaction logs for the three-
              node OpenVMS Cluster, follow these steps. Before starting,
              ensure that all three disks are mounted on all three nodes.

              1. For each node, define the logical SYS$JOURNAL to be a
                 search list of all the directories in Table D-1, with
                 the following command:

             $  DEFINE /SYSTEM /EXECUTIVE SYS$JOURNAL -
             _$ DISK$USER1:[LOGFILES], -
             _$ DISK$USER3:[LOGFILES], -
             _$ DISK$LOG:[LOGFILES]

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             You can enter all of the commands to set up the
             cluster from one node, using the SYSMAN Utility.

             ______________________________________________________

          2. Edit the common and node-specific versions of
             SYS$STARTUP:SYLOGICALS.COM files to include the
             definition of SYS$JOURNAL.

          3. Enter the following commands to create the transaction
             log files:

             $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:LMCP
             LMCP> CREATE LOGFILE DISK$USER1:[LOGFILES]SYSTEM$ORANGE/SIZE=5000
             LMCP> CREATE LOGFILE DISK$USER3:[LOGFILES]SYSTEM$RED
             LMCP> CREATE LOGFILE DISK$LOG:[LOGFILES]SYSTEM$GREEN/SIZE=6000
             LMCP> EXIT

             If you omit the /SIZE qualifier (for example, when
             creating the log for node RED), the transaction log
             is created with the default size of 4000 blocks.
