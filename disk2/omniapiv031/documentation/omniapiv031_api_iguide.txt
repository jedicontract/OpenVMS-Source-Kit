    1.2 System Software Requirements

          Your system requires the following minimum software
          versions:

          o  Mandatory:

             -  OpenVMS Version 6.1, 6.2, 7.0 or 7.1

                In order to successfully run DEComni API Version 3.1
                on OpenVMS Version 6.2, you must install a mandatory
                patch for the CMA (Common Multithread Architecture).
                The name of the CMA patch kit is as follows:

                   ALPCMAR04_062.A for OpenVMS Alpha
                   VAXCMAR04_062.A for OpenVMS VAX

          o  Optional:

        1.3 License Registration

              You must use the License Management Facility (LMF) to
              register the DEComni MMS software license in accordance
              with the license agreement signed for your site before
              you can run either the Installation Verification Procedure
              (IVP) or the software. License registration information
              is included in the Product Authorization Key (PAK) that
              is shipped with the DEComni software. The PAK contains
              licensing information that should be registered before you
              start the installation.

              To register the license, log into the SYSTEM account
              and set your default to SYS$UPDATE. You can register
              the license under LMF using either of the following two
              methods:

              o  Invoke the following procedure and enter the data
                 supplied by the PAK:

                 $ SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM

              o  Enter the following command, using the qualifiers that
                 specify the data supplied by the PAK:

                 $ LICENSE REGISTER DECOMNI-API/qualifier,...

              If you plan to use the DEComni software on more than one
              node of a VAXcluster system, you must load the license on
              each of the other nodes after you have completed this one.

              See the OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual for more
              information about using LMF.

        1.4 Installation Time

              Installing DEComni from CD-ROM on your target system
              takes approximately 2 minutes, depending on the system
              and media configuration. Installation may take longer on
              a system that is dependent on network activity during the
              installation.




                                                                      1-3

 







    1.5 Installation Privileges

          You require either the SETPRV privilege or all of the
          following privileges:

             CMKRNL
             WORLD
             SYSPRV

          The following command verifies your installation
          privileges:

          $ SHOW PROCESS /PRIVILEGES

    1.6 Required Disk Space

          The following free disk space is required on OpenVMS
          systems:

          ___________________________________________________________
                                  DEComni-
          Blocks to   Blocks to   specific      ODS Directory
          Install_____Run_________Files_________Structure____________

          45,000______40,000______35,000________3,500________________

          The following command verifies the available disk space:

          $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

          A feature of the DEComni API installation process allows
          you to locate the Omni Directory Services (ODS) directory
          structure on a disk other than the system disk. If you
          install the ODS directory structure on a separate disk,
          make sure that the disk has adequate free space.

    1.7 Omni Directory Services Directory Structure File Location in
        a VAXcluster Environment

          During the DEComni API installation process, you are
          asked where you want to locate the Omni Directory
          Services (ODS) directory structure. If you choose the
          default SYS$SYSDEVICE, the ODS directory is common to
          all nodes in the VAXcluster. If you want a separate ODS
          directory structure for each node, locate the directory in
          SYS$SPECIFIC. The directory structure requires 3,000 blocks
          for each node in the cluster.

        1.8 System Parameters and Settings

              The DEComni API installation requires specific system
              parameter settings.

        1.8.1 Displaying System Parameters

              The following minimum system parameter values are
              required for the installation and to accommodate the space
              requirements for DEComni API data structures:

                 FREE_GBLPAGES = 1000
                 FREE_GBLSECTS = 15

              You can determine the current number of free global pages
              and free global sections with the following commands:

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")

              The system displays the current values associated with the
              FREE_GBLPAGES and FREE_GBLSECTS parameter.

              For additional information about these parameters, or for
              help when verifying the values, see the OpenVMS System
              Manager's Manual for information about the OpenVMS System
              Generation Utility (SYSGEN).

              o  If you need to change one or more system parameters,
                 continue with Section 1.8.2.

              o  If you do not need to change system parameters, proceed
                 to Section 1.9.

        1.8.2 Changing GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS with AUTOGEN

              If you need to change the number of global pages or global
              sections, invoke AUTOGEN after you have entered the new
              parameter values in the SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file.
              AUTOGEN adjusts values for the parameters associated with
              the values that you reset manually.

              To change system parameters with AUTOGEN:

              1. Use an editor to access the SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT
                 file.

                 o  To change a parameter value that is already listed
                    in the file, delete the current value associated with
                    that parameter and enter the new value.

                                                                      1-5

 







             o  To modify incremental parameters, such as GBLPAGES
                or GBLSECTIONS, use the ADD_ command. The following
                example increases the global page setting by 380:

                   ADD_GBLPAGES = 380

          2. After you have made all of your changes, exit from the
             editor.

          3. Invoke the AUTOGEN procedure with the following command
             to recalculate your system parameters:

             $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT [NOFEEDBACK]

             If you specify REBOOT, AUTOGEN performs a system
             shutdown and reboots the system when it has finished.
             Any users logged in on the system are immediately
             disconnected during the shutdown. The reboot then puts
             the new parameter values into effect.

             The AUTOGEN utility adjusts some SYSGEN parameters based
             on the consumption of resources since the last reboot.
             If you do not want to use this adjustment, include the
             NOFEEDBACK parameter in the command line.

          See the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual for more
          information about using AUTOGEN.

    1.9 Installation Account Process Quotas

          You require the following minimum process quotas for the
          installation account (typically the SYSTEM account):

              ASTLM     =     24
              BIOLM     =     18
              BYTLM     =     32768
              DIOLM     =     18
              ENQLM     =     2000
              FILLM     =     50
              PGFLQUO   =     30000
              PRCLM     =     1+
              WSDEF     =     256
              WSEXTENT  =     3072
              WSQUO     =     768

    1-6

 







              You can use the AUTHORIZE utility to display installation
              process quotas by entering the following commands:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE
              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM

              If no changes are necessary, enter the EXIT command to
              leave the AUTHORIZE utility.

              To modify system account quotas (BYTLM, for example):

              UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM /BYTLM=32768

              The utility responds with a message confirming the change
              and you can enter the EXIT command to leave the utility.
              You must then log out and log in again to reset the system
              account quotas.

              For further information about using AUTHORIZE, refer to the
              OpenVMS System Manager's Manual.

        1.10 Backing Up the System Disk

              DIGITAL recommends that you do a full system disk backup
              before you start any installation procedures. Use
              the backup procedures established for your site. For
              information about performing a system disk backup, refer
              to your OpenVMS documentation.
















                                                                      1-7

 










                                                                        2

                                Installing DEComni API on OpenVMS Systems


              This chapter provides the requirements and procedures for
              installing the DEComni Application Programming Interface
              (API) software on a OpenVMS system.

        2.1 Installation Considerations

              This section provides information you may require during
              the installation process.

        2.1.1 DASware Installation

              The DEComni API Version 3.1 installation procedure allows
              you to install DASware (DASTKRUN, DASTK232).

              DASTKRUN and DASTK232 provide extensions to DEComni API, as
              required by some device access systems. On OpenVMS, DASware
              is not required by the following protocols:

              o  MMS

              o  AP

              o  H1

              o  Allen-Bradley

              You can therefore skip the DASware installation if you
              intend to use one of the suggested Device Access systems.

              The pre-requisites are as follows:

              o  DASTKRUN-DEComni API

              o  DASTK232-DASTKRUN.

              For further information, refer to the BASEstar Open Device
              Connectivity DASware User Guide.

                                                                      2-1

 







    2.1.2 VMSINSTAL Requirements

          When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it verifies whether you have:

          o  Logged into a privileged account

          o  Adequate quotas for the installation

          o  Other users logged in on the system

          o  Minimum SYSTEM account quotas listed in Section 1.9

          If VMSINSTAL detects any errors during the installation, it
          notifies you and exits from the installation procedure. You
          can restart the installation after you have corrected the
          problem.

    2.1.3 VMSINSTAL Error Messages

          If the installation fails for any reason, either during
          the installation or the IVP, VMSINSTAL displays a message
          similar to the following:

          %VMSINSTAL_E_INSFAIL, The installation of OMNIAPI V3.1 has failed.

          Refer to the OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference
          Manual for information about VMSINSTAL error messages.

          If it is possible to correct the problem, repeat the
          installation from the beginning. Otherwise, follow the
          procedures provided in Chapter 3.

    2.1.4 Stopping the Installation

          You can press <Ctrl>/<Y> to abort the installation at any
          time. You can also enter a question mark (?)  at any time
          for additional information. To restart the installation
          after pressing <Ctrl>/<Y>, you must repeat the entire
          procedure.

    2.1.5 Accessing the Release Notes

          DEComni API release notes are in an online ASCII text
          file that you can read or print before or after the
          installation. The release notes contain information about
          known problems or restrictions that apply to the current
          version of the product.

    2-2

 







                ________________________ Note ________________________

                DIGITAL recommends that you read the release notes
                before you install or run the DEComni API software.

                ______________________________________________________

              To display or print the release notes, use the OPTIONS N
              parameter when you invoke VMSINSTAL for the installation
              in Section 2.2. The OPTIONS N parameter also enables you to
              exit the installation procedure after reading the release
              notes.

              VMSINSTAL copies the release notes to SYS$HELP by default.
              The release notes file installed by VMSINSTAL is labelled
              with the current product name and version number, such as
              OMNIAPI031.RELEASE_NOTES.

        2.2 Installation Procedure

              This section describes the procedures for installing the
              DEComni API software. To perform the installation, you must
              be logged in on the system manager's account, or an account
              with the appropriate privileges.

        2.2.1 Invoking VMSINSTAL

              Either of the following commands invokes VMSINSTAL for the
              installation:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL OMNIAPIA031 ddcu:
              OPTIONS N

              Here, ddcu: is the device name, where dd is the device
              code, c is the controller letter, and u is the drive unit
              number of one or more digits (for example, MUA100:).

              Using OPTIONS N allows you to display or print the release
              notes before the installation. You can then continue the
              installation or exit from the procedure.



                                                                      2-3

 







    2.2.2 Installation Process

          VMSINSTAL starts the installation process with the display
          of messages and prompts similar to the following:

          1. The VMSINSTAL process starts by displaying a message
             similar to the following:

             OpenVMS ALPHA Software Product Installation Procedure V7.1

             It is 20-FEB-1997 at 11:43.

             Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

          2. The process then asks if you are satisfied with your
             system disk backup.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             System disk backup is a prerequisite for the
             installation.

             ______________________________________________________

             If you are not satisfied with the disk backup, enter NO
             to terminate the installation and perform the backup.
             Otherwise, enter YES or press <Return> to begin the
             installation process:

             * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? YES

             The following products will be processed:

               OMNIAPI V3.1

                     Beginning installation of OMNIAPI V3.1 at 11:43

             %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set A ...
             %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to 
             SYS$HELP.

             Installation procedure for: DEComni for OpenVMS Alpha (TM) V3.1

          3. If you used OPTIONS N in your VMSINSTAL command, the
             process prompts you for a release notes option number
             that executes one of the following:

    2-4

 







                 1 - Display release notes

                     Displays the online release notes.

                 2 - Print release notes

                     The process prompts you for an ASCII text printer queue
                     name. You can enter the queue name or press Return to send
                     the file to your default print device.

                 3 - Both 1 and 2

                     Displays the release notes online. If you terminate the 
                     display with Ctrl/C, the process prompts you for a printer
                     queue name. You can enter the queue name, or you can press
                     Return to send the file to the default print device.

                 4 - None of the above

                 When the selected operation has completed, VMSINSTAL
                 copies the release notes to SYS$HELP.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                DIGITAL recommends that you read the release notes
                before you continue the installation.

                ______________________________________________________

              4. The process asks you which products you want to install:

                 Select which products you want to install:

                       1) DEComni API
                       2) DASTKRUN
                       3) DASTK 232
                       4) ALL of the above

                       *******************************************************

                 * Enter number(s): [1]:)YES

              5. The process then displays the product identification and
                 authorization key prompt:

                         Product:      DECOMNI
                         Producer:     DEC
                         Version:      3.1
                         Release Date: 15-MAY-1997

                                                                      2-5

 







             * Does this product have an authorization key registered and 
               loaded? YES

             The DEComni API software can be installed but not
             run unless the Product Authorization Key (PAK) is
             registered. Enter YES to the authorization key prompt
             if you have registered and loaded the DEComni API PAK.

             Enter NO if you have not registered your PAK. The
             installation continues but you cannot run either
             the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) or the
             software. To run the IVP after the installation, you
             must register and load the PAK, then follow the IVP
             instructions in Section 3.1.

          6. If VMSINSTAL finds a DEComni API Version 2.n database,
             you can continue to use that database or create a
             new one. Normally, this would only occur if you are
             reinstalling Version 2.2. The system displays a message
             and prompt similar to the following:

                     *********************************************************
                     DEComni Version 2.n is installed  on this system. It  is
                     recommended that the database files be renamed or deleted
                     if you do not wish to use the existing database.
                     If you choose not to rename or  delete the database, the
                     existing database will continue to be used.
                     *********************************************************

                              1. Rename existing database
                              2. Continue to use existing database

             * Enter a number [2]: 1

          7. The process enquires whether you wish to use the OMNI_
             ODF facility. If you answer YES, and if a proper version
             of RDB is active on the system, VMSINSTALL links the

             restores OMNI_ODF.EXE in SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE].

             * Do you want to use OMNI_ODF facility? [YES]?

          8. VMSINSTAL then asks for the disk location where you want
             to install the Omni Directory Services (ODS) directory
             structure:

    2-6

 







                  A directory for Omni Directory Services will be created. You
                  need to provide the disk name in which the directory will be
                  located. If you do not specify a location, the directory will
                  be placed in SYS$SYSDEVICE:[OMNI...]. Include the colon after
                  the disk name.

                 * Enter the disk now [ddcu:] :

                 You can enter a new disk or press <Return> and use the
                 default disk you specified in step 1.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                In a VAXcluster environment, specifying SYS$SPECIFIC
                locates the ODS directory structure in a location
                that can only be accessed by the node on which the
                installation is being performed.

                ______________________________________________________

              9. VMSINSTAL displays the following questions about purging
                 the files replaced by the installation, and whether you
                 want to run the IVP as part of the installation:

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation 
                   [YES]? YES
                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? YES

              10.If a Multiversion product is installed, VMSINSTAL then
                 displays the current Rdb/VMS environment:

                 *******************************************************

              11.The installation process then begins and displays
                 a series of informational messages that include the
                 following:

        _________________________________________________________________

                                         Post-installation Considerations


              This chapter explains how to start, verify, and stop the
              DEComni Application Programming Interface (API) software,
              and provides account process information.

        3.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              If you did not run the Installation Verification Procedure
              (IVP) as part of the installation, you should run it
              separately after you have installed and started the
              product.

              You must enable the following privileges to invoke the IVP:

                 NETMBX
                 PRMMBX
                 SYSLCK
                 WORLD
                 GROUP

              Enter the following command to run the IVP:

              $ @SYS$TEST:OMNI_IVP

              The DEComni IVP verifies that the DEComni system is
              correctly installed and displays informational messages
              as it progresses. If the IVP fails, it displays a message
              indicating the reason for the failure. You should correct
              the problem, then reexecute the IVP. When the DEComni IVP
              has executed successfully, the DEComni API software is
              ready for use.

              The DEComni IVP can fail for various reasons. Table 3-1
              lists the possible causes for an IVP failure and ways to
              resolve the problem.


                                                                      3-1

          ________________________files._____________________________

    3.2 Starting DEComni API

          If you do not invoke the IVP during installation, you must
          use the following command to start DEComni API (before
          running any application program):

          $ @SYS$STARTUP:OMNI_STARTUP FULL

          Otherwise, you can execute the following command to start
          up DEComni API:

          $ @SYS$STARTUP:OMNI_STARTUP [AST]

          You must specify the AST parameter if you wish to use the
          AST-based version of DEComni API, rather than the thread-
          based version.

    3.3 Stopping DEComni API

          You require the following privileges to invoke the DEComni
          API stop procedure:

             DETACH
             PRMMBX
             SYSNAM
             CMKRNL
             SYSGBL
             PRMGBL
             WORLD
             GROUP

          Enter the following command to manually shut down the
          DEComni process:

          $ @SYS$MANAGER:OMNI_STOP

    3-2

 







              If you want the DEComni process to shut down each time
              the system is brought down, include the command in the
              site-specific shutdown file SYS$MANAGER:SYSHUTDWN.COM.

        3.4 Example Programs

              The SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.OMNI] directory contains
              some examples of DEComni API usage.

        3.5 Accessing the Release Notes

              You can consult the DEComni API release notes at
              any time after the installation from the SYS$HELP:
              directory. VMSINSTAL labels the release notes file with
              the current product name and version number, such as
              OMNIAPI031.RELEASE_NOTES.

        3.6 Getting Help and Reporting Problems

              If an error occurs while using the DEComni API, and
              you believe that the error is the result of a problem
              associated with the product, take one of the following
              actions:

              o  If you have a basic or DECsupport Software Agreement,
                 call your Customer Support Center (CSC). The CSC
                 provides telephone support for high-level advisory and
                 remedial assistance.

              o  If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement, you
                 can submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

              o  If you purchased DEComni within the last 90 days, and
                 you think the problem is caused by a software error, you
                 can submit an SPR.

              If you submit an SPR, please take the following steps:

              o  Describe as accurately as possible the circumstances and
                 state of the system when the problem occurred. Include
                 the description and version number of DEComni that
                 you were using. Demonstrate the problem with specific
                 examples.

              o  Reduce the problem to as small a size as possible.

              o  Remember to include listings of any command files,
                 include files, relevant data files, and so forth.

                                                                      3-3

 







          o  Provide a listing of the program.

          o  If the program is longer than 50 lines, submit a copy
             of it on machine-readable media (floppy diskette or
             magnetic tape). If necessary, also submit a copy of the
             program library used to build the application.

          o  Report only one problem per SPR. This will facilitate a
             faster response.

          o  Mail the SPR package to DIGITAL.

          Experience shows that many SPRs do not contain enough
          information to duplicate or identify the problem. Concise,
          complete information helps DIGITAL give accurate and timely
          service to software problems.

          If you find an error in the DEComni documentation, send an
          electronic mail message to manufacturing@digital.com.
