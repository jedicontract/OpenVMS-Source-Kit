PRODUCT NAME:   Compaq DASware V3.1                             SPD
60.46.06

DESCRIPTION

DASware is a general device connect product that contains the follow-
ing Compaq DAS modules:

o  Device Access Software for RS232 (OpenVMS, Tru64 UNIX, and Windows
   NT )

o  Device Access Software for TCP/IP (Tru64 UNIX, and Windows NT )

o  Device Access Software for OSI Transport Layer on Tru64 UNIX

Each DASware module allows BASEstar Open users and Compaq OMNI appli-
cations to exchange data with partner applications or devices in a protocol-
independent way through a specific Transport Network.

Individual DASware modules do not implement protocols and services for
the specific Transport Network. They provide a transport level inter-
face to higher level applications which implement the specific pro-
tocol for the device to be connected.

The main function of a DASware module is to adapt the interface of the
Transport Product specific to your platform to the BASEstar Open ser-
vices and Compaq OMNI API.

BASEstar Open Data Services provide device-independent access to data
allowing users to exchange data with partner applications or devices
simply by getting and putting the value of one or more Device_Data_
Points. Compaq OMNI API applications can perform the same functions
through the Compaq OMNI Application Programming Interface (API).

The Compaq OMNI API (with DASware) is supported on OpenVMS, and Tru64
UNIX.
