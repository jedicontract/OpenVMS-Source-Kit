DESCRIPTION

Compaq OMNI API is a network communications product that provides an
Application Programming Interface (API) for the connection and man-
agement of manufacturing shop floor devices and control systems.

The Compaq OMNI API is also bundled with the BASEstar Open product and

Components

Compaq OMNI API

Compaq OMNI API contains a callable runtime library that is an imple-
mentation of the MMS Device Model. Service classes supported are in
the following categories: Environment, VMD Support, Domains, Program
Invocations, and Variables.

ODSCL

ODSCL is a command line interface to the OMNI Directory Service. This
management level tool provides system managers the following functions:

o  Register directory names

o  Deregister directory names

o  Modify directory names

o  Query the directory

OMNIView

OMNIView is a demonstration application written using the callable in-
terface that operates in a DECwindows Motif® environment. It provides
a limited user interface to the following MMS client services from a
system running the prerequisite software:

o  Initiate

o  Conclude

o  Status

o  Abort

o  GetNameList

o  Identify

o  GetCapabilityList

o  Read

o  Write

o  Start

o  Stop

o  Reset

o  GetVariableAccessAttributes

o  GetDomainAttributes

o  GetProgramInvocationAttributes

OMNIView is only supported on OpenVMS systems.

Object Definition Facility (ODF)

                                 2

 

ODF is used to define the objects and attribute values that are ex-
pected to be found at a remote Virtual Manufacturing Device (VMD). This
facility is also used to define aspects of a local VMD if supported
by the application.

ODF is used to define the mapping of MMS variable types to and from
OpenVMS data type definitions.

ODF is only supported on OpenVMS systems.

Compaq OMNI API Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

The Compaq OMNI API IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper
installation.

INSTALLATION

uct. Compaq recommends that all other customers purchase Compaq In-
stallation Services. These services provide for installation of the
software product by an experienced Compaq software specialist.

Installation for Compaq OMNI API consists of the following:

o  Verification that all components of Compaq OMNI API have been re-
   ceived

o  Verification that the necessary versions of the pre-requisite soft-
   ware and documentation are available

o  Verification of the appropriate system parameters

o  Verification that the system meets the minimum hardware and soft-
   ware requirements as specified this SPD

o  Customer making available for a reasonable period of time, as mu-
