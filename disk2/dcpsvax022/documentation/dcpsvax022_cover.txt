          Dear DECprint Supervisor Customer:

          Thank you for purchasing DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS,
          V2.2. DCPS is a layered product that runs on OpenVMS Alpha and
          VAX systems to provide access to selected PostScript printers.
          The DCPS V2.2 software kit includes:

          o  Software Product Description (SPD)

          o  CD-ROM containing software kit

          o  V2.2 Release Notes, which you can extract from the kit

          o  V2.2 Documentation in multiple formats

          Before installing this product, please take a few minutes to
          read the Release Notes. For complete information about this
          product, refer to the DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS Software
          Product Description (SPD 44.15.13) included in this kit.

          Starting with DCPS V2.0, the right to use all DCPS functionality
          is included with the OpenVMS operating system license. The DCPS-
          OPEN license previously required to access third-party printers
          and the DCPS-PLUS license previously required for some DCPS
          features are no longer needed.

          DCPS V2.2 also adds support for 9 new printer models from HP,
