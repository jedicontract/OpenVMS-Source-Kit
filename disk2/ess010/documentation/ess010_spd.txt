     PRODUCT NAME:  DEC InfoServer Client for VMS, Version 1.0    SPD
     33.91.01

     DESCRIPTION

     DEC InfoServer Client for VMS enables VAX systems running the
     VMS Operating System to access the InfoServer 100 Ethernet-based
     virtual disk server.

     The InfoServer 100 is an Ethernet-based, high performance vir-
     tual disk server. Physical disk media and sets of logical disk
     blocks can be served to the network by the InfoServer. Host
     systems running the appropriate client software can connect to
     the virtual disks served by the InfoServer 100 and use them as
     though they were locally attached devices.

     DEC InfoServer Client for VMS is used by VMS client systems
     to install or upgrade software using the InfoServer 100-based
     media, access on-line documentation via the Bookreader with the
     InfoServer 100 as its data source, or access any other CDROM-
     based data with a disk format supported by VMS. Software product
     installations or upgrades must be supported by the version of
     VMS running on your system. The VMS Operating System can only be
     upgraded to VMS V5.4 or later from an InfoServer disk.

     Although the InfoServer 100 supports read-write access, this kit
     is restricted to providing read-only support to the InfoServer
     100. VMS V5.4 supports read-write access to InfoServer 100. This
     kit can be used to upgrade to VMS V5.4, which is packaged with
     the full read-write InfoServer Client software.
