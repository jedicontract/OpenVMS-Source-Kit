                                                                  Preface



              The DECwindows[TM] DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator
              for OpenVMS[TM] is a software product that allows users
              to communicate interactively with programs running on
              an IBM[R] host computer. This communication takes place
              through one of Digital Equipment Corporation's interconnect
              systems.

        Manual Objectives

              This document describes how to install the Terminal
              Emulator (TE) product on a VAX[TM], or AXP[TM] computer
              running the OpenVMS operating system.

        Intended Audience

              This document is intended primarily for system managers
              or anyone responsible for installing and maintaining
              application software.

              Keep this document with your distribution kit. You will
              need it to install maintenance updates or to reinstall the
              software.

              For more information on installing the TE software on
              OpenVMS systems, refer to the installation/operations guide
              for your particular processor.

        Structure

              This manual describes the installation procedure step by
              step. The system prompts you to answer questions and to
              perform tasks, such as changing volumes, and waits for you
              to tell it to continue.

                                                                        v

 







          Each question in the installation is marked with an
          asterisk (*) at the beginning of the line. Some questions
          show the default response in brackets, for example [YES].
          If you want to give the default response for a particular
          question, simply press <Return>.

                                               Preparing for Installation


              Before you install the DECwindows DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal
              Emulator for OpenVMS software, you must prepare your
              system, its communications components, and the remote
              system to ensure proper operation of the software.

              This chapter describes the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing the Terminal Emulator (TE)
              product. The actual installation is covered in Chapter 2.

              Your bill of materials (BOM) specifies the number and
              contents of your media. Check the contents of your kit
              against this information. If your kit is damaged or if
              you find that parts are missing, contact your Digital
              representative before continuing the installation.

        1.1 Required Operating System Components

              The TE requires the following OpenVMS Versions to install:

              For a VAX system-OpenVMS VAX Version 5.4 or later

              For an AXP system-OpenVMS AXP Version 1.5 or later

    1.2 Prerequisite Software Requirements

          Version 2.0 of the TE requires OpenVMS VAX Version 5.4
          or later, or OpenVMS AXP Version 1.5 or later (with
          DECwindows OSF/Motif Version 1.0 or later), including
          the corresponding version of DECnet. The TE software also
          requires one of the following system configurations for
          proper operation.

          o  The DECnet SNA Gateway-ST, Gateway-CT, or DEC SNA Domain
             Gateway-CT, must be part of your DECnet network

             or

          o  the VMS/SNA (on OpenVMS VAX systems only) software must
             be installed on the node on which you are planning to
             install the TE software.

          For more information on these products, see the following
          documentation:

          o  DECnet SNA Gateway-CT and Gateway-ST Management

          o  DECnet SNA Gateway-ST Installation

          o  DECnet SNA Gateway-CT Installation

          o  DEC SNA Domain Gateway-CT Installation

          o  VMS/SNA Installation

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             You must install DECwindows Motif window manager
             software (at lease DECwindows OSF/Motif V1.0 VAX or
             V1.1 AXP) before you run the TE software.

             ______________________________________________________

    1.2.1 Accessing Online Release Notes

          The TE provides online release notes which you should read
          before installing the product. The release notes contain
          the latest product enhancements and may include changes to
          the installation procedure. If you executed the VMSINSTAL
          command procedure with the OPTIONS N parameter, you are
          asked if you want to display or print release notes during
          the installation procedure.

    1-2 Preparing for Installation

 







              After you have installed the product, you can read the
              release notes by using the TYPE command or by printing
              SYS$HELP:SNADWTE020.RELEASE_NOTES.

    1.3 OpenVMS License Management Facility

          The license registration information is contained in
          the Product Authorization Key (PAK) shipped with the TE
          software. The PAK is a paper certificate that contains
          information about the license that enables you to run a
          particular piece of software. Digital Equipment Corporation
          recommends that you register your TE license before you
          perform the installation. Once you perform the license
          registration and have loaded an authorization key, you will
          be able to run the TE software.

          To register a license, begin by logging in to the system
          manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice of two
          ways to perform the registration:

          o  Execute the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM command procedure.
             When it prompts you for information, respond with the
             information that is on your Product Authorization Key
             (PAK) form.

          o  Issue the LICENSE REGISTER DCL command with the
             appropriate qualifiers that correspond to information
             on the PAK.

          For complete information on using LMF, see the manual on
          the License Management Utility in the OpenVMS documentation
          set.

    1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements

          The following sections detail the various requirements for
          installing TE software.

          The installation should take 5 to 10 minutes, depending on
          the type of media and your system configuration. Before
          installing the software, you must have the following
          privileges:

          o  SETPRV privilege, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
             privileges. Note that VMSINSTAL disables BYPASS
             privilege at the start of the installation.

          For VAX systems, you must have the following resources:

          o  For client systems: a minimum of 5148 blocks of free
             disk space during installation, and 1749 free blocks
             after installation.

    1-4 Preparing for Installation

 







              o  For server systems: a minimum of 5148 blocks of free
                 disk space during installation, and 147 free blocks
                 after installation.

              o  A minimum of 3 free global sections at installation.

              o  A minimum of 767 free global pages.

              For AXP systems, you must have the following resources:

              o  A minimum of 5148 blocks of free disk space for
                 installation.

              o  A minimum of 2664 blocks of free disk space for server
                 systems, or 183 for client systems, after installation.

              o  A minimum of 1473 global pagelets.

              o  A minimum of 2 free global sections at installation.

        1.4.1 Checking Parameter Values on Your System

              You must have enough global pages and global sections free
              on your system to install and run the product. This may
              mean increasing the values for global pages (GBLPAGES)
              and global sections (GBLSECTIONS) on your system. Begin
              by referring to Section 1.4 to find the minimum values for
              GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS required to run the TE product
              on your system. Next, find out how many global pages and
              global sections are available on your system. To do this,
              proceed as follows:

              1. First, run the OpenVMS Install Utility (INSTALL) as
                 shown.

                 $ INSTALL LIST/GLOBAL/SUMMARY

                 The INSTALL utility displays a summary of global pages
                 and global sections used by your system, as well as the
                 current number of unused global pages. Here is a sample
                 display:

                                  Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

                 258 Global Sections Used,  22580/3420 Global Pages Used/Unused

              2. Use this summary information and the information given
                 in Section 1.4 to determine whether it is necessary
                 to increase the value of the GBLPAGES parameter. In
                 the sample summary shown here, the difference between
                 the number of pages used (22,580) and unused (3,420)

                                           Preparing for Installation 1-5

 







             greatly exceeds the number needed to run the TE product
             (a minimum of 650, according to Section 1.4). Thus, in
             this case, you would not need to adjust the value of
             GBLPAGES.

          3. Now run the SYSGEN utility to determine the number of
             global sections that have been allocated. Note that
             the sample summary shows that 258 global sections are
             already in use by the system.

             $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
             SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS

             Parameter Name  Current Default Minimum  Maximum Unit Dynamic
             --------------  ------- ------- -------  ------- ---- -------
             GBLSECTIONS         512     250      20     4095 Sections

             The display shows that 512 global sections exist on the
             system, of which 258 are in use. Subtracting 258 from
             512 reveals that the number of global sections available
             (254) exceeds the number required by the TE product
             (a minimum of 3 for VAX, and 2 for AXP, according to
             Section 1.4). In this case, you would not need to adjust
             the value of GBLSECTIONS.

    1.4.2 Increasing Your System Parameter Values

          You can use the AUTOGEN command procedure to increase
          system parameters values. This procedure automatically
          adjusts values for parameters associated with those you
          reset manually. To change system parameters with AUTOGEN,
          edit this file:

          SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

          For example, to set a minimum value for the GBLSECTIONS
          system parameter, add this line to the file:

          MIN_GBLSECTIONS = 1024

          Or for incremental SYSGEN parameters:

          ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000


    1-6 Preparing for Installation

 







              After updating this file, run the AUTOGEN procedure to
              recalculate your system parameters. Do this by entering
              this command at the DCL prompt:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

              AUTOGEN performs an automatic system shutdown and reboots
              when it has finished. Rebooting your system makes the new
              parameter values active. Also, on OpenVMS Version 5.4
              systems you may wish to add the [NO]FEEDBACK parameter
              to the AUTOGEN command line. For more information
              about using AUTOGEN, see the instructions on modifying
              system parameters in the OpenVMS documentation on System
              Management and Operations.

        1.4.3 Backing Up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if you
              have backed up your system disk. Digital recommends that
              you do a system disk backup before installing any software
              on top of the operating system.

              Use the backup procedures that have been established at
              your site. For details on performing a system disk backup,
              see the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS
              documentation set.

        1.4.4 License Management Utility Requirements

              In order to run the Installation Verification Procedure,
              you need to register and load your license for the TE
              before you start the installation.

              Refer to the OpenVMS documentation on the License
              Management Utility for information about registering your
              license.

                                                   Installing the Product


              This chapter describes how to install the DECwindows DECnet
              SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS (TE) software using
              the VMSINSTAL procedure. Throughout this procedure, default
              values appear in brackets. To abort the procedure at any
              time, press <Ctrl/Y>. This action causes the installation
              procedure to delete all files it has created up to that
              point and to return to DCL.

              Each question in the VMSINSTAL procedure is marked with an
              asterisk (*). Some questions show the default response in
              brackets, for example [YES]. To choose the default response
              for any question, simply press <Return>.

        2.1 Check Requirements Before Beginning Installation

              You may have problems installing the product if you have
              not met one of the following requirements. Before beginning
              the installation, be sure that you have:

              o  the correct operating system version

              o  the correct prerequisite software version

              o  sufficient process quotas

              o  sufficient system parameter values

              In addition, check to see that:

              o  the OpenVMS help library is available for use

              o  the product is properly licensed

    2.2 Run the VMSINSTAL Procedure

          The TE installation process takes from 5 to 10 minutes
          to complete. It consists of a series of questions and
          informational messages. If desired, you can produce a copy
          of the installation procedure by using this command:

          $ SET HOST 0/LOG=file-name

          where file-name is the name of the file in which you wish
          to store the installation procedure log information. (If
          you do not specify a file name, the system creates a file
          called SETHOST.LOG.) After completing the installation,
          you can log off from the current session and print the file
          that contains the log of the installation procedure.

          Begin the installation

          To start the installation, execute the VMSINSTAL command
          procedure from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM
          account. Use the following command to start VMSINSTAL:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SNADWTE020 device-name OPTIONS N

          where

          SNADWTE020       identifies the TE software.

          device-name      is the name of the device on which you
                           will mount the media.

          OPTIONS N        is an optional parameter that indicates
                           you want to be prompted to display or
                           print the release notes.

          The following example displays the command to invoke
          VMSINSTAL to install the product from tape drive MKA500.
          This example uses the OPTIONS N parameter for printing or
          displaying release notes.

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SNADWTE020 MKA500: OPTIONS N

              * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

              If you do not supply either the product name or the device
              name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information later in
              the installation procedure. VMSINSTAL also prompts you for
              any options you want to use with the installation.

              Back up your system disk

              VMSINSTAL now asks if you have made a backup copy of your
              system disk. You should always back up your system disk
              before performing an installation.

              * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

              If not satisfied with the backup of your system disk, enter
              NO to discontinue the installation. You can restart the
              installation after you back up your system disk.

              Mount the media

              Now mount the first distribution volume. These three
              prompts appear if you did not specify a device when
              invoking VMSINSTAL:

              * Where will the distribution volumes be mounted?:

              Enter the products to be processed from the first distribution
              volume set.

          Choose a release notes option

          If you specified OPTIONS N when invoking VMSINSTAL, the
          procedure specifies four options for reviewing the release
          notes:

          Release Notes Options:

              1. Display release notes
              2. Print release notes
              3. Both 1 and 2
              4. None of the above

          * Select option [2]:

          Selecting option 1 displays the release notes on your
          terminal. You can terminate the display at any time by
          pressing <Ctrl/C>.

          Option 2 prompts you for the name of the print queue to
          which you want to send the file:

          * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

          Either type a queue name or press <Return> to send the file
          to SYS$PRINT.

          Option 3 displays the release notes on the terminal and
          prompts you for a queue name for the printed version.

          Option 4 allows you to continue the installation without
          displaying or printing the release notes.

          The procedure now prompts you to continue the installation.
          Enter YES to continue, or NO to terminate the installation.

          * Do you want to continue the installation?[N] YES
          %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product release notes have been moved to

              The release notes are located in SYS$HELP.

              Choose components to install

              The TE installation kit contains two components: TE
              software and workstation fonts. At this point, you have
              to decide whether to install one or both of them.

                      DECwindows DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS, V2.0
                                      Installation Procedure

              This DECwindows DECnet SNA 3270 TE installation includes both
              3270 TE software and workstation font files. You can choose to
              install one or both of these on this OpenVMS node.  Note that the
              video font files are required on all workstations where the 3270
              TE is to be displayed.

              * Do you want to install the entire kit [YES]?

              Answer YES to install the entire kit. If you answer NO, the
              procedure asks these two questions:

              * Do you want to install the 3270 TE software [NO]?

              * Do you want to install the workstation fonts [NO]?

              Answer YES or NO to these questions (the default answer for
              each is NO), as your needs dictate. If you answer NO to all
              three of these questions, the procedure asks:

              * Terminate the installation [YES]?

              Answering NO to this question will give you the opportunity
              to respond again to each of the preceding three questions.

              Register your product license

              The procedure now displays license information specific to
              the product and asks if you have registered and loaded your
              product authorization key.

              Product:          DW-SNA-3270-TE-VMS
              Producer:         DEC
              Version:          2.0
              Release Date:     14-APR-1992

              * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

          Unless an authorization key has been registered and loaded,
          you will not be able to use the product. If this is the
          case, you must answer NO to this question; otherwise,
          answer YES.

          Want to run the IVP?

          The next question asks whether you want to run the IVP
          during the installation. The banner that follows informs
          you that you must designate a node for the TE's display. Be
          sure that this node has proper security. Otherwise the TE
          will not be able to display on it and the IVP will fail.

          Note that the procedure also gives you the option to purge
          the files installed with an earlier version of the product.

          * Do you want to run the IVP as part of the installation [Yes]?

                ***************************************************
                * Running the IVP causes the TE to display on a   *
                * node you designate.  This node must be running  *
                * DECwindows and its security must be set up to   *
                * allow the TE to display on it.                  *
                ***************************************************

          * What transport do you wish to use to display the TE?:

          * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

              All questions have been asked, installation continuing ...

          Scan informational messages

          The procedure now displays messages pertaining to the
          progress of the installation. If the installation procedure
          has been successful so far, the procedure moves the new
          or modified files to their target directories, and updates
          help files and DCL tables.

              The next messages pertain to the product font files, and
              to the need to modify your system startup procedure so
              that it installs the TE with each reboot. For information
              on copying font files to other servers after they are
              installed, see Section 3.1.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The workstation fonts must be installed on any

                product.

                ______________________________________________________

              Product font files have been moved to the
              DECwindows font directories.

              You have installed the TE product as a shareable image.  To
              install the image each time the system reboots, add this line to
              your system startup procedure:

                       $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNADWTE$STARTUP

              If you are installing the product on a cluster, be sure to add
              this command to the system startup procedure on each cluster node.

              The installation procedure next displays the following
              messages:

              The IVP for this product, SNADWTE$IVP.COM, can be found in
              the SYS$TEST directory.
              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target
              directories...

              Running the IVP during the installation

              If you chose to run the IVP as part of the installation
              procedure, VMSINSTAL runs it now. Running the IVP starts
              the TE product and displays it on the node you designated
              earlier in this procedure. The next group of messages
              pertain to the IVP. When the IVP is successful, you will
              see the dialog box shown in Figure 2-1.

              If the IVP fails

              If the IVP fails, the procedure displays these messages:

              SNADWTE V2.0 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of SNADWTE V2.0 has failed.

              In case of failure, refer to Section 2.1 for a list
              of conditions that may prevent the IVP from completing
              successfully.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process
                symbol table during the installation. Therefore, if
                you are going to continue using the system manager's
                account and you want to restore these symbols, you
                should log out and then log in again.

                ______________________________________________________

        2.2.1 Read the Product's Release Notes

              After the installation, you can enter the following
              command to review the release notes (file) through the
              help facility:

              $ HELP SNA_DWTE RELEASE_NOTES

        2.2.2 Running the IVP After Installation

              Digital recommends that you run the IVP during
              installation, but you may also want to run the procedure
              after a system failure to determine whether the product
              has been affected. You may also want to run the IVP to
              verify that the specific font files necessary to run the
              product reside on a server node. You can run the IVP after
              installation by issuing this command from any account:

              $ @sys$test:snadwte$ivp

        2.2.3 Files Added to your System

              Installing the product adds a number of new files to your
              system. Appendix B lists these files and their locations.

              After installing the TE, you may need to perform some or
              all of the following tasks:

              o  Copy font files to servers

              o  Copy TE fonts to Digital X Terminals

              o  Load alternate keyboard maps and function definitions

              o  Edit the system startup file

              o  Run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

              o  Reboot the system

              o  Set user account quotas

              o  Install the TE for use on a VAXcluster

        3.1 Copying Font Files to Servers

              In all DECwindows applications, the client is the node
              that contains the executable image; the server is the node
              (workstation) that displays the executable image. In many
              cases, the client and server are the same node.

              The TE distribution kit contains the font files (see
              Table 3-1) that enable the product to be displayed on
              OpenVMS and ULTRIX[TM] servers.

    3.1.1 Using the Font Copy Utility

          The Font Copy Utility makes it easy to copy necessary font
          files to X terminals you want to function as servers for
          the TE. To use this utility you must first install the
          necessary font files on the TE client node. Once you have
          done this, start the utility by entering this command from
          a session on the TE client:

          $ @SYS$COMMON:[SNADWTE$FONTS]SNADWTE$COPY_FONTS

          The remainder of this section consists of a sample run of
          the utility, showing the prompts and messages you will see
          when copying font files to each of server the TE supports.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             This sample shows the text you may see if copying
             fonts to each supported type of server. You may copy
             fonts to only one or two of the supported servers;
             hence, the text you see when running the utility may
             differ from that shown here.

        3.2 Copying TE Fonts to Digital X Terminals

              If you are using a VT1000[TM], VT1200[TM], VT1300[TM]
              or VXT2000[TM] terminal to display the TE, you have to
              prepare the OpenVMS host to support your terminal. You must
              export TE fonts from the OpenVMS host and load them to the
              terminal. For detailed information on preparing your host
              system, see the documentation accompanying your X terminal.
              The TE fonts are located in:

                                                   After Installation 3-5

 







          SYS$COMMON:[SNADWTE$FONTS]*.DECW$FONTS

    3.3 Loading Alternate Keyboard Maps and Function Definitions

          By default, the TE function definitions and keyboard
          layout map to an LK201-style keyboard. However, the TE
          also supports keyboard function definitions and layouts
          for the IBM Enhanced PC and Macintosh keyboards. If you
          are using the TE on either a PC or Macintosh X Server,
          you should install your server's function definitions and
          keyboard map. Refer to Chapter 2 of DECwindows DECnet SNA
          3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS Use for instructions on
          how to do this.

    3.4 Editing System Files

          You must edit the system startup file to provide automatic
          startup of the TE when your system is rebooted.

          Add the command line that starts the TE to the system
          startup file, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM.

          $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNADWTE$STARTUP

          You must position this new command line after the line
          that invokes the network startup command procedure. The
          following example shows the network startup command line
          followed by the startup command line for the TE:

          $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
               .
               .
               .
          $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNADWTE$STARTUP

    3.5 Rebooting the System

          You can reboot your system after you have installed the
          TE, edited the system startup file, and reset the system
          parameters (if necessary). A system reboot verifies that
          the product is ready for use, ensures that the edits to the
          system startup command file are correct, and establishes
          any new parameter settings. Note, however, that rebooting
          is optional.

    3-6 After Installation

 







        3.6 Setting User Account Privileges

              To use the TE, user accounts on your system must have
              certain privileges and quotas. Each account must have
              at least TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges. Use the OpenVMS
              Authorize Utility to determine whether users have the
              privileges they require.

        3.7 Installing the TE on a VMScluster System

              If you want to run the TE software on multiple nodes
              of a VMScluster system, first verify that you have the
              appropriate software license. Then add this command to the
              startup file of each node on the cluster:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNADWTE$STARTUP.COM

              After installing the software, issue this command for each
              cluster node:

              $ LICENSE LOAD DW-SNA-3270-TE-VMS
              $ @SYS$STARTUP:SNADWTE$STARTUP.COM

        3.8 Copying Translation Tables

              To copy translation tables from an OpenVMS load host to an
              OpenVMS TE client, use the this command:

              $ COPY GWNODE::SYS$LIBRARY:SNADWTE$DEF.EXE SYS$LIBRARY:SNADWTE$DEF.TBL

              This command copies translation tables to the default file
              SYS$LIBRARY:SNADWTE$DEF.TBL.

              To copy translation tables from an ULTRIX load host to
              an OpenVMS TE client, begin by generating the translation
              table on the load host by issuing this command:

              # snatratbl snadwte_def.tbl

              Next, use this command to copy the translation table from
              the ULTRIX load host:

              $ COPY ULTRIX_load_host::"directory/snadwte_def.tbl" SYS$LIBRARY:SNADWTE$DEF.TBL

    3.9 Determining and Reporting Problems

          If an error occurs while the TE is being used and you
          believe it is a TE error, you should take one of the
          following actions:

          o  If you have a BASIC or DECsupport Software Agreement,
             call your Customer Support Center. (With these services,
             you receive telephone support that provides high-level
             advisory and remedial assistance.)

          o  If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement, you
             can submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

          o  If you purchased the TE within the past 90 days and you
             think the problem is caused by a software error, you can
             submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

          If you find an error in the TE documentation, you should
          complete and submit the Reader's Comments form at the back
          of the document in which the error was found. Include the
          section and page number of the error.

              This appendix contains a sample installation of the
              DECwindows DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS
              (TE). This sample was run on a system that had no previous
              version of the TE installed.

              You should assume that in the sample installation,
              DECnet[TM] has been shut down, no users are logged on to
              the system, and that OPTIONS N is specified to print the
              release notes. The Installation Verification Procedure
              (IVP) runs at the end of the installation.

                                             SAMPLE LOGMODE Table Entries


              IBM host applications must realize that the TE can handle
              extended data stream and query (used to identify the
              graphic capabilities of the TE); therefore, you should
              define appropriate entries in the LOGMODE table.

              The following sample entries define the 3192-G and 3279-S3G
              in the LOGMODE table:

              S3192G   MODEENT LOGMODE=S3192G,                            X
