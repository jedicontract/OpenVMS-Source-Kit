              Digital is pleased to provide the DEC Distributed Queuing
              Service (DQS) Version 1.3 for OpenVMS Systems. This
              software is an OpenVMS layered product that uses the
              DECnet networking system to extend the OpenVMS print queue
              system to a distributed system environment. With the DQS
              product, users can access OpenVMS printers anywhere on the
              network.
