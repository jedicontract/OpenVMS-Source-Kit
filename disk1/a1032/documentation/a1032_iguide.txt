                                   Preparing Your System for Installation


              This chapter describes the tasks that you must do
              to prepare your system for an ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2
              installation. The information in this chapter applies to
              all installations.

              You must read the  ALL-IN-1 Overview and Planning Guide
              before you install ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2. The planning guide
              covers:

              o  Information about this version of ALL-IN-1

              o  Mail system planning

              o  Installation planning, including a checklist of all
                 the decisions that you need to make before starting the
                 installation

                 In addition, if you are upgrading from ALL-IN-1 Version
                 3.1 and your system has been customized, you must
                 read the chapter Planning the Upgrade of a Customized
                 System in the Overview and Planning guide. This chapter
                 explains how to run the Conflict Checking and Resolution
                 Tool (CART) to check your customizations before you
                 upgrade to ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2.

              This installation guide assumes that you have read the
              ALL-IN-1 Overview and Planning Guide, made all your
              planning decisions and know what type of installation you
              are going to perform.

          Online release notes are provided with the language and
          market components of ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2. The release
          notes contain information that was unavailable before
          the books went to print. It is recommended that you read

              the release notes, because they may contain information
              relating to the installation. You can access the release
              notes using the VMSINSTAL procedure before you install the
              ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 software.

              There are two parts to the ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 release
              notes:

              o  Release Notes Part 1 Language

                 This part contains the release notes specific to the
                 ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 language being installed.

              o  Release Notes Part 2 Market

                 This part contains the release notes specific to your
                 ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 market component. Note that this
                 document may not exist for all market components.

              To read or print the release notes, do the following:

              1. Log in to the privileged OpenVMS system manager's
                 account and enter the following command lines:

                 $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
                 $ @VMSINSTAL product device: OPTIONS N

                 where device is the device on which the media containing
                 the appropriate version of the release notes is mounted
                 and product is the product code. The product codes are:

                 o  A1Llang032 for the Release Notes Part 1 Language,
                    where lang is the 2-letter code for the language you
                    are installing

                 o  A1Cmarket032 for the Release Notes Part 2 Market,
                    where market is the 2-letter code for the market
                    component you are installing

                 If you are performing an additional language
                 installation, you need only print the  ALL-IN-1 Release
                 Notes Part 1 Language that is supplied with your kit.

              When you have read or printed the release notes, terminate
              the installation procedure. If you have accessed only one
              part of the release notes, repeat the procedure to access
              the other part. The following files are placed in SYS$HELP:

              o  A1Llang032.RELEASE_NOTES, for the Release Notes Part
                 1 Language, where lang is the 2-letter code for the
                 language you are installing

    1.3 Checking Prerequisite and Optional Software

          Table 1-2 provides information about the prerequisite
          software for an ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 installation. It
          also lists the software that is supplied with the ALL-IN-1
          Version 3.2 kit, and optional software that you may want to
          install.

          The following definitions apply:

          o  Prerequisite means that the software must be installed
             before you install ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2. The
             installation will fail if the prerequisite software
             is not installed.

          o  Optional means that the software is not required for the
             ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 installation. Optional software
             provides additional functionality and the optional
             software that you install depends on the requirements
             at your site. For example, if you want to use Group
             Conferencing, you must install DEC Notes.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Both the prerequisite software, and any optional
             software that you want to install, must be installed,
             configured and running before you install ALL-IN-1
             Version 3.2.

    1.4 Checking the License for the Installing Account


    1.4 Checking the License for the Installing Account

          The installing account, from which you plan to do the
          installation, must have a valid ALL-IN-1 license. This
          means that you must have one of the following:

          o  A Capacity licence

          o  A Concurrent license with available units

          o  A personal license with the name of the installation
             account in the reserve list of users.

             For example, if you are planning to do the installation
             from the SYSTEM account, SYSTEM must be listed in the
             reserve list.

          The installing account should be licensed with the
          maximum available license to ensure that all the required
          functionality can be installed.

    1.5 Registering License Product Authorization Keys (PAKs)

          You must register the ALL-IN-1 License Product
          Authorization Key (PAK) before you start to install the
          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 software. The installation procedure
          checks for a registered ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 license when
          you confirm that you are ready to install the software by
          choosing the Perform the installation (I) option from the
          menu of installation options. If a license is not found,
          the installation terminates.

          To register an ALL-IN-1 license PAK for a new installation,
          see Section 1.5.1.

          When you have registered the ALL-IN-1 License PAK, you
          can use the Register licenses for prerequisite software
          (RL) option to automatically register License PAKs for
          additional software that is provided with the ALL-IN-1
          Version 3.2 kit. See Section 1.5.3.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             You must make sure that all the License PAKs are
             registered on all nodes on which you intend to use
             the software.

             For products that are not included in the ALL-IN-1
             kit, for example the MAILbus 400 MTA or Digital X.500,

                you must register the license PAKS manually using the
                License Management Facility (LMF).

                ______________________________________________________

        1.5.1 Registering the ALL-IN-1 License PAK Before a new
              Installation

              If you are installing ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 on a newly-
              licensed node or cluster, you must register a License
              PAK for ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 before you install ALL-IN-1
              Version 3.2. The License PAK may be shipped along with
              the kit if you ordered the license and media together;
              otherwise, it is shipped separately to a location based on
              your license order. License PAKs are registered using the
              License Management Facility (LMF).

              To register the ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 License PAK, do the
              following:

              1. Log in to the system manager's account, SYSTEM.

              2. Register the License PAK in one of the following ways:

                 o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure.
                    When it prompts you for information, respond with
                    information from your License PAK.

                 o  Issue the DCL command, LICENSE REGISTER, together
                    with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to
                    information on the License PAK.

              For complete information on using the LMF, see the OpenVMS
              License Management Utility Manual.

        1.5.2 Registering the ALL-IN-1 License PAK Before an Upgrade

              If you are installing ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 as an upgrade or
              update installation on a node or cluster already licensed
              for this software, you must register the Service Update
              PAK (SUP) that is included in your Service Update Kit.
              If you have already registered a License PAK or a SUP for
              this product on this node or cluster, you do not need to
              register the SUP.

              If you are installing an update of ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 but
              lack a service contract, call your Digital representative
              for instructions on how to get a License PAK.

    1.5.3 Registering License PAKs for Software Provided with
          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2

          When you have registered the ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 License
          PAK, you must register the License PAKS for the products
          supplied with the ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 kit. The following
          License PAKs can be registered automatically using the
          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 installation procedure:

          The License PAKs supplied for these products are for any
          processor and any number of users. If you already have a
          license for one of these products, it will be replaced by
          the license supplied with the ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 kit. The
          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 License PAK must be registered first.

          To register the License PAKs automatically, follow Steps 1
          to 5 in Table 2-2.

          Enter RL when the installation prompts you with the
          following question,

          * Which installation do you wish to perform [1]:

             Choosing the RL option does not start the
             installation.

             ______________________________________________________

          The installation procedure checks your existing licenses,
          and if necessary registers and loads the appropriate
          licenses for the software products provided with the
          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 kit. The installation then terminates.

              For prerequisite or optional products that are not supplied
              with ALL-IN-1, you must register the license PAKs manually
              using the License Management Facility (LMF).

        1.6 Example Order for Installing Optional Software

              After you have installed and configured the prerequisite
              software, install and configure the optional software
              products. See the appropriate product documentation for
              installation and configuration instructions.

              The following installation order is suggested for
              installing optional software before the ALL-IN-1 Version
              3.2 installation:

              1. Install ACMS[TM]

              2. Install VAX DATATRIEVE[TM] or DEC DATATRIEVE

              3. Install and configure your message transport and
                 directory service software.

                 o  For new or upgrade installations with Message
                    Router, make sure that Message Router is installed,
                    configured and running before you start the ALL-IN-1
                    installation. If you plan to use a remote Message
                    Router Directory Service, you must do a customized
                    Message Router configuration to enable remote
                    Directory Service access and configure Message
                    Router exception reporting for the Directory Service
                    and Transfer Service according to your planning
                    decisions.

                 o  For new installations with Digital X.500 and the
                    MAILbus 400 MTA make sure that you have installed
                    and configured all the required components on
                    your ALL-IN-1 node or cluster. Digital X.500 and
                    the MAILbus 400 MTA must be correctly installed,
                    configured and running before you start the new
                    ALL-IN-1 installation. See the MAILbus 400 MTA and
                    Digital X.500 Planning chapter in the  ALL-IN-1
                    Overview and Planning Guide.

              4. Install and configure optional gateway products.

                 o  The Message Router VMSmail Gateway if required with
                    Message Router.

    1.7 Installation Procedure Requirements

          This section describes the requirements for installing
          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2. It explains how to check the values
          and how to change them if necessary.

    1.7.1 Installing Account Requirements

          Use the SYSTEM account to install ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2.

          The installing account must have a valid rights identifier
          which is the same as the UIC for the account name. If you
          are using the SYSTEM account, the rights identifier must
          be the same as the UIC. To check the UIC and identifier
          values, do the following:

          $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE
          UAF> SHOW/IDENTIFIER SYSTEM

          The value that is displayed is the UIC of the system
          account. To add the rights identifier, if it is not set
          up, do the following:

          UAF> ADD/IDENTIFIER SYSTEM/VALUE:UIC=[1,4]
          UAF> EXIT

          The installing account must also have sufficient quotas
          to enable you to perform the installation. Table 1-3
          summarizes the requirements.

          Note that these values are sufficient for installation,
          but they may not be appropriate for running ALL-IN-1. When
          you create new user accounts for ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 the
          process quotas are set to the appropriate values. See the
          ALL-IN-1 Management Guide.

        1.7.2 System Parameters

              Table 1-4 lists the minimum required system parameter
              values for the installation. Depending on the kinds of
              programs and applications running at your site, you may
              need higher values for some settings. If necessary, modify
              the parameters to at least these values.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                You must check the OpenVMS system parameters on each
                node in the cluster on which you install ALL-IN-1
                Version 3.2.

                ______________________________________________________

              The values for the system parameters and quotas given in
              this section are those specific to ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 and
              are acceptable for most systems. The  ALL-IN-1 Management
              Guide describes how to set system parameters for ALL-IN-1.

              Dynamic system parameters are labelled with a (D) after
              them. You do not need to reboot your system after changing
              dynamic system parameters. If you need to set new values
              for other system parameters, you must reboot your system in
              order for the changes to take effect.

        1.7.3 Displaying Current System Parameters

              Run the SYSGEN utility to display the current parameter
              settings:

              1. To display all the current system parameter settings,
                 enter:

                 $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
                 SYSGEN> SHOW /ALL

              2. To show each system parameter setting separately enter:

                 SYSGEN> SHOW parameter

                 where parameter is the parameter you want to examine.

              3. Press Ctrl/Z to leave SYSGEN.

              To check the number of free global pages and sections,
              enter the following commands:

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")

              If the value of free global pages or global sections is
              less than the value in Table 1-4 you must increase the
              system parameter setting. If the values displayed by the
              system are greater than the required values, you do not
              need to change the values for these parameters.

        1.7.4 Changing System Parameter Values

              Edit the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT to change the system
              parameter values. The entry that you make in this file
              depends on which of the parameters you are modifying. See
              Table 1-5.

              If you need to change and update non-dynamic system
              parameters, you must schedule time to reboot your system
              in order for the changes to take effect. The (D) after
              the system parameter value shows that they are dynamic
              parameters.

    Preparing Your System for Installation
    1.7 Installation Procedure Requirements


    1.7.5 Disk Space on Your System Disk or Alternate Working Device

          This section discusses the disk space requirement for
          your kit working device during an ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2
          installation.

          The default disk for your kit working device is your system
          disk. If your system disk does not have sufficient space,
          you can specify an alternate working device (AWD) when you
          start the installation.

          The disk space values for your kit are given in the
          ALL-IN-1 Installation: Language and Market Supplement.
          You must also check the disk space requirements on the
          target disks where ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 will be installed.
          See Section 1.7.7.

          You can run the installation in either safety or non-safety
          mode.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Digital recommends that you run your installation in
             safety mode (the default).

             ______________________________________________________

          When you run the installation in safety mode, all of
          the ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 kit is restored onto the
          system disk or AWD before the files are copied to their
          target locations. This means that you need a disk space
          requirement greater than the total size of the ALL-IN-1
          Version 3.2 kit on your system disk. The disk space values
          for installing your kit in safety mode are given in the
          ALL-IN-1 Installation: Language and Market Supplement.

          If you do not have enough disk space to run the
          installation in safety mode, you can run the installation
          in non-safety mode. In this case, each kit saveset is
          restored to the system disk before being copied to the
          target area. You need an amount of disk space on your
          system disk greater than the size of the largest saveset
          provided in the ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 kit. The disk space
          values for installing your kit in non-safety mode are
          given in the  ALL-IN-1 Installation: Language and Market
          Supplement.

                                  1.7 Installation Procedure Requirements


        1.7.6 Using the OA$LIB_SHARE Disk as the AWD

              If you have sufficient space on the target disk on which
              OA$LIB_SHARE will reside, Digital recommends that you use
              this disk as the AWD. If you do have sufficient space
              to install on this target disk, the installation time
              can be reduced by approximately 20%. This is because the
              majority of the ALL-IN-1 files reside in the OA$LIB_SHARE
              directory and therefore the installation procedure can move
              those files to their target directories by using a RENAME
              operation, rather than a COPY operation.

        1.7.7 Disk Space for ALL-IN-1 Areas on Target Disks

              You can install ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 in the following ways:

              o  On a single target disk

              o  Across several target disks by installing ALL-IN-1 areas
                 on separate disks.

              For upgrade installations, the installation procedure
              assumes that the ALL-IN-1 disks and top-level directories
              for the ALL-IN-1 areas have not changed, and that the
              ALL-IN-1 directory tree is the same. If you have moved
              any of the directories, you must put them back to their
              correct locations before upgrading.

              You can install more than one ALL-IN-1 area on the same
              disk. If you do this, add the disk space values for the
              two areas together to find the total space required on that
              disk. See  ALL-IN-1 Overview and Planning Guide for more
              information about ALL-IN-1 areas.

              The disk space requirements for ALL-IN-1 language and
              market areas that you are installing are in the  ALL-IN-1
              Installation: Language and Market Supplement.

              To calculate the total disk space requirements for your
              installation, add together the disk space requirements
              given in this section and the requirements given in the
              ALL-IN-1 Installation: Language and Market Supplement.

              The disk space requirements for each ALL-IN-1 area are
              listed in the following tables:

              o  Table 1-6 for a new installation. See Section 1.7.9.

    Preparing Your System for Installation
    1.7 Installation Procedure Requirements


          o  Table 1-7 for an upgrade installation. See
             Section 1.7.10.

          o  Table 1-8 for the addition, upgrade or update of VAX or
             Alpha architecture support. See Section 1.7.11.

             These values can also be used for the addition, upgrade
             or update of architecture support for an additional
             language.

          You are prompted to specify the target disks for each
          ALL-IN-1 area during the installation.

    1.7.8 Assigning Logical Names to Your Disks

          Digital recommends that you assign logical names to your
          disks where possible.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             To avoid conflicts with system logical names, do not
             assign logical names that start with:

             o  A1$

             o  OA$

             o  OA1$

             ______________________________________________________

          In all types of installation, the installation procedure
          checks for conflicting system and process logical names,
          which could cause the installation to fail. You can check
          for conflicts before you start the installation. See
          Section 1.11 which describes how to run the Perform all
          preinstallation checks (PC) option.

          The logical name checking includes a check for any existing
          logical names that start with OA$. An informational message
          lists the names found, and a warning message warns you that
          these logical names may be redefined.

          If a logical name conflict is found, an informational
          message is displayed. If the conflicting logical name is
          defined in a system table, you can remove the conflicting
          logical name from another process, and then repeat the
          check. If the conflicting logical name is specific to the
          installing process, then you must abort the installation to

              fix the problem and then restart it. The installation will
              not continue until the logical name checking has passed.

              For all upgrade or update installations, make sure
              that ALL-IN-1 logical names do not point to system root
              directories; for example, OA$LIB_SHARE must not be defined
              as SYS$SYSROOT:[ALLIN1.LIB_SHARE].

              Do not use SYS$SYSDEVICE in directory specifications if
              you are installing on a mixed architecture cluster as the
              SYS$SYSDEVICE is different for each architecture.

        1.7.9 New Installation: Disk Space for ALL-IN-1 Areas

              Table 1-6 gives the disk space requirements for installing
              ALL-IN-1 areas on the system and target disks.

              The disk space requirements given are those used during
              the installation. The permanent space used when the
              installation has completed may be slightly less.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you do not choose to integrate WPS-PLUS during the
                installation, you can decrease the disk space in the
                shared library area by approximately 6000 blocks.

                If you choose to integrate WPS-PLUS, but without the
                associated PostScript[R] files, you can decrease the
                disk space in the shared library area by approximately
                3000 blocks.

    1.7.10 Upgrade Installation: Disk Space for ALL-IN-1 Areas

          Table 1-7 gives the disk space requirements for upgrading
          ALL-IN-1 areas on the system and target disks.

          The disk space requirements given are those used during
          the installation. The permanent space used when the
          installation has completed may be slightly less.

          The values given in the table assume that you choose to
          purge files during the installation. If you choose not
          to purge replaced files, you must use the values given in
          Table 1-6.

                If you do not choose to integrate WPS-PLUS during the
                installation, you can decrease the disk space in the
                shared library area by 5000 blocks.

                If you choose to integrate WPS-PLUS without the
                associated PostScript files, you can decrease the
                disk space in the shared library area by 2000 blocks.

        1.8 Additional Tasks for Upgrade Installations

              If you are upgrading an existing ALL-IN-1 system, do the
              following:

              1. Review your object libraries.

                 Your object libraries may have been updated if you
                 installed layered products. ALL-IN-1 provides two
                 template .OLB files in the following directories:

                 -  OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE:SITEOALIBR.OLB

                 -  OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV:SITEOALLV.OLB

                 During the installation, a warning is displayed if there
                 are additional .OBJ or .OLB files in these directories.
                 Check that any additional object libraries or files
                 in this directory are compatible with ALL-IN-1 Version
                 3.2. Remove any object libraries or files that are not

             compatible. Although these files are not used during the
             installation, they will cause problems if you need to
             relink ALL-IN-1 after the installation.

          2. If you have a multilingual system, check that the files
             OA$LLV*.EXE are not in SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]. If they are,
             move them to the SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB] directory before
             upgrading.

          3. Check that all files in your site areas have at least
             system write access (S:W) and that Digital ALL-IN-1
             directories in non-site areas also have system delete
             access (S:D).

          4. Make copies of customized data files. See Section 1.8.1.

    1.8.1 Copying Customized Data Files

          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 uses modified versions of several data
          files:

          o  In the base area:

             -  A1CONFIG.DAT

             -  OA$PC_NOTIFY.DAT (a secondary key has been added)

             -  PROFILE.DAT

             -  SM_ACCOUNT_TYPES.DAT (The form is SMTEMPLATE)

          o  In the language areas:

             -  FORMAT.DAT (New records have also been added)

             -  OA$PRINTSTYLES.DAT (The form is SMPRINTERTYPES and
                new records have also been added)

          o  In users' areas:

             -  OA$USERPRINTERSTYLES.DAT (The form is
                USERPRINTSTYLES)

          o  Files which have not been converted but their record
             layouts have changed:

             -  ATTENDEE.DAT

             -  DOCDB.DAT

              o  Files which have not been converted but their records
                 have changed or new ones have been added:

                 o  CM$SDC

                 o  CM$CART$RUNS.DAT

                 o  OA$SM_UTILITY_MASTER

                 o  X400COUNTRY_CODES.DAT

                    This file has been replaced by a new one with
                    additional records.

              ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 also supplies new versions of the
              File Definition Language (FDL) files in OA$LIB_SHARE which
              are used to convert the corresponding data files to the
              new format. The old FDL files are not required after the
              upgrade.

              Before upgrading, make copies of any data files that you
              have customized as new versions of data files are provided
              with ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2. You must also return the data
              files to the Digital standard format before you upgrade.

              In the following instructions, the data file, PROFILE.DAT
              is used as an example. To make copies of your customized
              data file and return them to the Digital standard format,
              do the following:

              1. Make a backup copy of the modified PROFILE.DAT file,
                 preferably outside the ALL-IN-1 directory structure:

                 $ COPY OA$DATA_SHARE:PROFILE.DAT device:[directory]CUSTOM_PROFILE.DAT

              2. Use Customization Management to make copies of the
                 customized PROFILn forms. For example, copy the
                 customized forms to CUSTOM_PROFILn and modify the
                 named data so that the .FILE and FORM_SET directives
                 specify the location of the backup copy of the file. The
                 following example shows the parts of the named data that
                 must be modified.

                 ;;.FILE;;

                 OA$DATA_SHARE:PROFILE.DAT,OA$LIB:PROFILE.FDL
                 ;;.FORM_SET;;

                 PROFIL2,PROFIL3,PROFIL4,PROFIL5,PROFIL6,PROFIL7,PROFIL8

              3. Make the copies of the customized forms live.

          4. Remove the customized PROFILn forms and PROFIL.FDL from
             the live area.

          5. Convert the modified PROFILE.DAT back to the standard
             format. This may temporarily lose some data, but you can
             reapply it from the backup copy of PROFILE.DAT later. To
             convert PROFILE.DAT back to the Digital standard format,
             enter the following from the choice field of a menu:

             <OA$CNV_CONVERT CUSTOM_PROFIL,PROFIL

             This creates a new version of OA$DATA:PROFILE.DAT to use
             during the upgrade.

          6. Upgrade to ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2.

          7. Follow the postinstallation instructions in
             Section 5.10.3 to restore your customizations.

    1.9 Using the MAILbus 400 MTA and Digital X.500

          You can install a new ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 system with the
          MAILbus 400 MTA and Digital X.500. You cannot upgrade from
          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.1 using these products.

          For a new ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 installation, with Digital
          X.500 and the MAILbus 400 MTA you must make sure that you
          have installed all the required MAILbus 400 MTA and Digital
          X.500 components on your ALL-IN-1 system, configured them
          and completed any additional setup tasks. See the checklist
          in the MAILbus 400 MTA and Digital X.500 Planning chapter
          in the  ALL-IN-1 Overview and Planning Guide.

    1.10 Using a Remote Message Router

          If you will be using a remote Message Router that is not in
          the same VMScluster, you must do the following:

          1. On the remote Message Router node, create an ALL-IN-1
             mailbox for the node (or cluster) on which you are
             installing ALL-IN-1. See Section 1.10.1.

          2. Create an entry for the remote Message Router node in
             the network nodes database on the local machine on which
             you are installing ALL-IN-1.

              3. Ensure that Message Router is running on the remote node
                 before you start the installation. If it is not running,
                 you will see errors when the installation procedure
                 starts up the Sender and Fetcher processes.

        1.10.1 Create an ALL-IN-1 Mailbox on the Remote Message Router
               Node

              Do this if you are planning to use a remote Message Router.
              If you do not create a mailbox before the installation, you
              will see problems when the installation procedure starts up
              the Sender and Fetcher processes.

              Message Router must be running and configured before you
              start the installation.

              If you are using a remote Message Router which is on a node
              in the same VMScluster as ALL-IN-1 the ALL-IN-1 mailbox
              name will be A1.

              If the remote Message Router is not in the same VMScluster,
              other ALL-IN-1 systems may be sharing the same Message
              Router. The name of the Message Router mailbox must be
              unique for your system. For example, the mailbox name,
              mailboxname, could be localnodeA1 where localnode is the
              name of the node or the cluster on which you are installing
              ALL-IN-1. password is the password that you want to use
              for the Message Router mailbox. You are prompted for this
              password during the installation.

              On the Message Router node, do the following to create the
              ALL-IN-1 mailbox:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:MRMAN
              MRM> ADD mailboxname /PASSWORD=password /COMPLETE_MESSAGES /IGNORE_SENDER _
                   /SERVICE_MESSAGES /SUPPRESS_DELIVERY_REPORTS
              MRM> EXIT

              Note that you must not use the /OWNER qualifier when
              setting up the mailbox.

    Preparing Your System for Installation
    1.11 Running the Preinstallation System Check


    1.11 Running the Preinstallation System Check

          The ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 installation procedure provides a
          Perform all preinstallation checks (PC) option. Digital
          recommends that you use this option before installing
          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 to ensure that you have made all
          necessary system changes before installing the software.

          You can use this option while an existing ALL-IN-1 system
          is running so you do not have to ask your users to log out
          of the system.

          The option for preinstallation checks allows you to:

          o  Run the phase of the installation in which you answer
             questions and the installation procedure performs system
             checks

          o  Fix errors encountered by the installation procedure

          o  Exit without performing the installation

          Where possible the installation checks are done in an order
          which finds fatal errors first. Section 1.11.1 describes
          the types of errors that are detected. Section 1.11.2
          describes how to use the Perform all preinstallation checks
          (PC) option.

    1.11.1 Types of Errors Reported

          The following types of errors are detected:

          o  Fatal errors

             These are errors which cannot be corrected without
             stopping the installation procedure. Fatal errors
             include:

             -  Errors that require the machine to be rebooted

             -  Errors that require an upgrade to prerequisite
                software, including OpenVMS, Message Router and the
                Message Router VMSmail Gateway, or Digital X.500, the
                MAILbus 400 MTA and Message Router Gateway.

          o  Non-fatal errors

                 These are errors that can be corrected from another
                 process without stopping the installation procedure.
                 Non-fatal errors include:

                 -  Shareable images that are not installed

                 -  Logical names that are not defined

                 -  System parameters that can be changed dynamically

                 -  Prerequisite software files that are missing

                 -  Insufficient disk space

        1.11.2 Running the Perform all Preinstallation Checks (PC) Option

              To run the Perform all preinstallation checks (PC) option,
              follow Steps 1 to 6 in Table 2-2 until you are prompted
              with a list of installation options.

              Do the following:

              1. Press Return to choose the default option.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Choosing this option does not install the software.

                ______________________________________________________

                 The following message is displayed:

                   The installation procedure allows you to perform the following actions:

                   (I)   Perform the installation
                   (PC)  Perform all preinstallation checks

                 * Which action do you wish to perform [I]:

              2. Choose the Perform all preinstallation checks (PC)
                 option by entering: PC.

              3. If a check fails with an error that can be corrected
                 without stopping the installation procedure, you
                 are asked if you want to correct the error before
                 continuing.

                 If you answer yes, the installation checking procedure
                 pauses so that you can fix the error from another
                 process. When the error is fixed, you can resume the
                 procedure, and the check is repeated.

    1.11 Running the Preinstallation System Check


             If you choose not to correct the error, you have the
             option of halting the procedure or continuing to perform
             the remaining checks. If you choose to continue, the
             installation procedure will terminate when all the
             checks are performed.

    1.12 Final System Preparation Tasks: New Installations

          To prepare your system for a new ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2
          installation, do the following:

          1. Check that all prerequisite software is installed,
             configured and running.

          2. Start the queue manager, if necessary.

          3. Back up the system disk and any target disks. See
             Section 1.14.

    1.13 Final System Preparation Tasks: Upgrade Installations

          For an upgrade installation from ALL-IN-1 Version 3.1,
          carry out the following steps before starting the
          installation. Each step is described in the following
          sections.

          From the privileged SYSTEM account, do the following:

          1. Shut down ALL-IN-1. See Section 1.13.1.

          2. Ensure that Message Router is running and is correctly
             configured.

          3. Deinstall files in the site areas that are installed in
             memory. See Section 1.13.2.

          4. Start the queue manager, if necessary.

          5. Back up the system disk and any target disks. See
             Section 1.14.

              1.13 Final System Preparation Tasks: Upgrade Installations


        1.13.1 Shut Down ALL-IN-1

              Ask users currently on the system to log out, and then shut
              down ALL-IN-1.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                ALL-IN-1 must not be used by any batch jobs or users
                during the installation, or the installation will
                fail.

                ______________________________________________________

              Do not allow anyone to log in again while the installation
              is in progress. You can allow OpenVMS users to remain on
              the system, but it is important to ensure that users do
              not use DCL HELP while the installation is in progress,
              as this can cause file locking problems when the DCL HELP
              library is updated during the installation. If possible,
              it is safer to ensure that there are no active users on the
              system.

        1.13.2 Deinstall Files Installed in Memory

              If you have any files in the site areas that are installed
              in memory, for example, SITE$OA.A1$SECTION, deinstall
              them on all nodes in the cluster before you start the
              installation. Deinstalling files from memory will prevent
              them from being write locked. The installation sets an
              ACL on all files in the site areas so you must ensure that
              all files in the site area have system write access (S:W).
              Make sure that you deinstall any of your own code-level
              executable images that are installed in memory.

        1.14 Back Up Your System and Target Disks

              Digital recommends that you do a system disk backup before
              installing any software because:

              o  If a system failure occurs at a critical point during
                 installation, your ALL-IN-1 system could be left in an
                 inconsistent state.

              o  You can verify that the backup copy contains a working
                 system image and then replace the system disk with it.

              o  There is more contiguous free space, which may be needed
                 for installation.

    Preparing Your System for Installation
    1.14 Back Up Your System and Target Disks


          If you are going to install ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 on more
          than one disk, back up the target disks that you will be
          using.

          Use the backup procedures that are established at your
          site. For details on performing a system disk backup, see
          the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS System
          Management Subkit.

          At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if you
          have backed up your system disk.

                 Version 3.2 with Message Router and the Message Router
                 Directory Service. The installation is done on the
                 Alpha system in a mixed-architecture VMScluster, where
                 Message Router is installed on a remote VAX node. See
                 Section 2.1.

              o  Addition or upgrade of additional architecture support
                 on a mixed-architecture VMScluster. See Section 2.2.

                __________________ Before You Start __________________

                Do not start the installation until you have done the
                following:

                1. Planned your installation by reading the  ALL-IN-1
                   Overview and Planning Guide.

                           The installation can take from one to
                           six hours, depending on the type of
                           processor you are using. The performance
                           specification of the disks has the
                           greatest effect. For example, an
                           installation on a VAX 4000-300 system
                           takes approximately 3.5 hours when files
                           are installed on an RF71 disk and 1.5
                           hours if files are installed on an RZ26
                           disk.

                           The times for new and upgrade
                           installations are approximately the same.

        2.1 Installation Procedure for New and Upgrade Installations

              Table 2-2 lists all the installation steps for a new or
              upgrade installation. The example scripts in the table
              show extracts from a new installation on an Alpha system
              using the MAILbus 400 MTA and Digital X.500 and an upgrade
              installation from ALL-IN-1 Version 3.1 with Message Router.

              Depending on your distribution media, you may be prompted
              to change the tape or cartridge during the installation.

    Table 2-2 Installation Procedure for New and Upgrade
    __________Installations__________________________________________

    Step__Action_____________________________________________________

    1     Create a log file for the installation. Digital recommends
          that you keep a record of the installation in case of
          problems. You can keep a log by using either a hard copy
          terminal or a log file. To keep a record in a log file,
          enter:

          $  SET HOST 0/LOG=filename

          where filename is the name of the log file. The log file
          is created in the directory where you enter the command.
          If you do not specify a filename, the file is called
          SETHOST.LOG. The installation log file will be about 200
          blocks.

          If you are running console management software, you can
          use this to record the installation. See your console
          management documentation for further information.

    _________________________________________________________________

    2     Load and mount the media that contains the software kit.

          If you are installing from a tape or cartridge, you will
          be prompted to change the tape or cartridge when required.
          You do not need to change the media when you are installing
          from a compact disc (CD).

          X.500: Confirm that you want to use the MAILbus 400 MTA
          for remote mail.

            If you plan to use MAILbus 400 as your MTA, then answer YES to this

            question. You will not have been offered this choice unless the

            installation checks have revealed that the product is installed.

            Note that even though MAILbus 400 appears to be installed and initially

            configured, it is unlikely that it will sucessfully process your mail

            until you have completed all the set up tasks described in the Mail

            Management Guide.

            If you answer NO to this question, ALL-IN-1 users will only be able

            to exchange messages locally, unless you subsequently choose to use

            Message Router (if it is available.)

          * Do you want to use MAILbus 400 for remote mail [YES]?

          Press RETURN to use the MAILbus 400 MTA for remote mail.

          It does make any difference to the installation if the
          MAILbus 400 MTA is installed on the same node as ALL-IN-1
          or on a different node in the same VMScluster on a remote
          node outside the cluster, providing that you have completed

        Step__Action_____________________________________________________

        22    Upgrade_Installation: Confirm that you want to use Message
              Router for remote mail.

              ALL-IN-1 on a VAX node can be configured to use a local
              Message Router which is installed on the same node or a
              remote Message Router which is installed on a different
              node. ALL-IN-1 on an Alpha node can only use a remote
              Message Router. This example script is on an Alpha system
              so it must be configured to use a remote Message Router.

              * Do you want ALL-IN-
              1 to be configured to use Message Router [YES]?

              Answer Y to confirm that you want to use Message Router.

        _________________________________________________________________

        23    Upgrade_Installation: If Message Router is not installed
              on this node, confirm that you want to use a remote Message
              Router.

              * Do you want to use a remote Message Router [YES]?

              Enter Y to confirm that you want to use a remote Message
              Router.

              Note that the default value for this answer depends on
              whether you are doing the upgrade installation on a VAX
              system or an Alpha system. In this example, the upgrade
              is on an Alpha system, so the default is to use a remote
              Message Router.

          All the installation questions have now been completed.

          If you are installing ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 on a mixed-
          architecture VMScluster, see Section 2.2 for instructions
          on adding architecture support for a second architecture.

          If you are not installing on a single-architecture
          VMScluster, go to Section 2.3.

    2.2 Adding or Upgrading Architecture Support

          Table 2-3 explains when you can do an installation to add
          or upgrade architecture support.

          The questions that you are asked during the additional
          architecture installation depend on the responses that you
          gave during the new or upgrade installation. For example,
          if you did not install WPS-PLUS during the new or upgrade
          installation, you are not asked any additional questions
          about WPS-PLUS.

            Installation Procedure: New, Upgrade and Architecture Support
                             2.2 Adding or Upgrading Architecture Support


        2.2.1 Before You Start

              Before you start the installation, you must do the
              following:

              1. If you are installing architecture support for the
                 first time, make a note of the location of the ALL-IN-1
                 configuration file, OA$DATA_SHARE:A1CONFIG.DAT, on the
                 system where you have already installed a new ALL-IN-1
                 Version 3.2 system or upgraded to an ALL-IN-1 Version
                 3.2 system. You will be asked for this information
                 during the installation.

              2. Run the script, OA$LIB:SM_CHECK_SYS$SYSDEVICE.SCP, to
                 check for logicals containing SYS$SYSDEVICE.

              3. From the ALL-IN-1 manager's account on the node
                 where ALL-IN-1 is already installed, run the script,
                 OA$LIB:SM_CHECK_SYS$SYSDEVICE.SCP:

                 $ SET HOST 0/LOG=filename
                 $ ALLIN1/NOINIT
                 Enter CMD: DO OA$LIB:SM_CHECK_SYS$SYSDEVICE.SCP

                 If references to SYS$DEVICE are found, a warning message
                 is displayed. You must remove the references as they
                 will refer to different devices on a VAX system and an
                 Alpha system. If the references are not corrected, data
                 may be lost on your system.

                 The installation procedure also runs this script.

        2.2.2 Installation Procedure for Adding Architecture Support

              Table 2-4 shows an example script for an additional-
              architecture installation on a VAX system. The following
              information is used:

              o  ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 is already installed on an Alpha
                 system in the same VMScluster.

              o  WPS-PLUS is installed on the Alpha system.

              o  ALL-IN-1 has been configured as a multilanguage system
                 on the Alpha system.

              o  Message Router is installed on this VAX system.

                  You have chosen an architecture only installation.  To continue you

                  must specify the location of the existing ALL-IN-1 system's configuration

                  file (A1CONFIG.DAT).  The installation will read A1CONFIG.DAT to

                  determine file target locations.

              * Please give the directory location of A1CONFIG.DAT: disk:[directory]

        1     Create a log file for the installation. Digital recommends
              that you keep a record of the installation in case of
              problems. You can keep a log by using either a hard copy
              terminal or a log file. To keep a record in a log file,
              enter:

              $  SET HOST 0/LOG=filename

              where filename is the name of the log file. The log file
              is created in the directory where you enter the command.
              If you do not specify a filename, the file is called
              SETHOST.LOG. The installation log file will be about 200
              blocks.

              If you are running console management software, you can
              use this to record the installation. See your console
              management documentation for further information.

    Installation Procedure: Additional Languages
    3.2 Installing Architecture Support for an Additional Language


    3.2 Installing Architecture Support for an Additional Language

          Before you start the installation, you must do the
          following:

          o  Make a note of the location of the ALL-IN-1
             configuration file, OA$DATA_SHARE:A1CONFIG.DAT, on
             the VAX system. You will be asked for this information
             during the installation.

          o  Run the script, OA$LIB:SM_CHECK_SYS$SYSDEVICE.SCP, to
             check for logicals containing SYS$SYSDEVICE.

          From the ALL-IN-1 manager's account on the node where you
          have already installed ALL-IN-1, run the script, OA$LIB:SM_
          CHECK_SYS$SYSDEVICE.SCP:

          $ SET HOST 0/LOG=filename
          $ ALLIN1/NOINIT
          Enter CMD: DO OA$LIB:SM_CHECK_SYS$SYSDEVICE.SCP

          If references to SYS$DEVICE are found, a warning message
          is displayed. You must remove the references as they will
          refer to different devices on a VAX system and an Alpha
          system. If the references are not corrected, data may be
          lost on your system.

          Follow the steps in Table 3-2 to add architecture support
          for an additional language that you have already installed
          on a different architecture in the same VMScluster. The
          example script shows the addition of VAX architecture
          support for ALL-IN-1 BRITISH as an additional language.
          BRITISH is already installed as an additional language on
          an Alpha system in the same VMScluster.

                                          Installation Errors and Failure


              This chapter deals with various error messages you may
              see while installing ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 or while the
              Installation Verification Procedures (IVPs) are running,
              and explains what to do if the installation or the IVPs
              fail.

              While the installation is running it displays various
              informational messages. It may also display warning or
              error messages. Read all the messages displayed, and take
              whatever action they advise.

        4.1 Common Error Message That Does Not Require Action

              The following error message may be ignored if it is
              displayed during the installation:

              %DELETE-W-SEARCHFAIL

              This error occurs randomly. A file is always specified
              in the error message, but the file has been correctly
              provided.

        4.2 Common Errors Which Require Action

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exist:

              o  There is a problem with the operating system.

              o  There is a problem with prerequisite software.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  System parameter values for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

    4.2 Common Errors Which Require Action



          o  SYS$LIBRARY:IMAGELIB.OLB and SYS$LIBRARY:STARLET.OLB
             are not present. These files are removed if you tailor
             OpenVMS.

          For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
          conditions, see the OpenVMS books on system messages,
          recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software installation.
          If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
          you should take the appropriate action as described in the
          message.

    4.3 Failure During Postinstallation

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             When the installation procedure reaches the
             postinstallation phase, the main installation has
             completed. If the postinstallation tasks fail, a
             message is displayed indicating that the installation
             has failed and that you need to reinstall ALL-IN-1.
             It is not necessary to do this; you need only rerun
             A1$POSTINSTALL.COM as described in this section.

             You must rerun A1$POSTINSTALL.COM on the node on which
             you originally ran the installation.

             ______________________________________________________

          The procedure used to execute the automatic
          postinstallation tasks is written during the installation.
          Its content depends on the installation type, and
          conditions specific to your system. The command file is
          called A1$POSTINSTALL.COM, and it is provided to OA$LIB_
          language.

          If any postinstallation tasks fail, messages to aid
          investigation are displayed. If the installation has failed
          during the postinstallation phase, you can do one of the
          following:

          o  Rerun A1$POSTINSTALL.COM on the node on which you
             orginally ran the installation.

          o  Edit A1$POSTINSTALL.COM to create your own command
             procedure using only the commands for the tasks that
             have failed.

    4-2 Installation Errors and Failure

 



                                      4.3 Failure During Postinstallation



              When the installation has completed, there are still
              some manual postinstallation tasks to be performed. See
              Chapter 5.

              After the automatic postinstallation tasks have completed,
              the installation procedure displays:

              Installation of A1 V3.2 completed at <hh:mm>

              Enter EXIT, or press CTRL/Z to exit from VMSINSTAL.

              Note that the installation procedure deletes or
              changes entries in the process symbol tables during the
              installation. Therefore, if you are going to continue using
              the system manager's account, you must log out and log in
              again.

        4.4 Installation Failure

              If the installation fails before the postinstallation
              phase, the following message is displayed:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of ALL-IN-1 V3.2 has failed.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If the installation fails, you must restart the
                installation from the beginning.

                ______________________________________________________

        4.4.1 Failure of Upgrade Installations in Safety Mode

              If your installation is being performed in Safety mode, you
              need take no further action if the failure happens before
              the message:

              Files will now be moved to target directories

              If the installation fails after this message, restore
              your original system from a backup. You can then go
              back to using the original system, or you can start the
              installation again.

    4.4 Installation Failure



    4.4.2 Failure of Upgrade Installations in Non-Safety Mode

          If your installation is being performed in non-safety mode,
          restore your original system from a backup. You can then
          go back to using the original system, or you can start the
          installation again.

    4.4.3 Full Installations

          If a full installation fails, delete all accounts,
          identifiers and directories that have been created, and
          start the installation again.

    4.4.4 Failure Due to Insufficient Dynamic Memory

          An installation on an Alpha system may fail with the
          following error message:

          %SYSTEM-F-INSFMEM, insufficient dynamic memory

          If this error occurs, you must check that the value for
          CTLPAGES is high enough. If you used the default value
          of 100, you must increase it to 200 and restart the
          installation. See Section 1.7.2.

    4.5 Error Messages when Running the IVP

          The following informational and error messages are
          displayed when the IVP is run:

          %OA-I-LNF, Error opening form library "THIS_IS_A_TEST"
          -RMS-E-FNF, file not found

          %OA-W-INVGET, Symbol "THIS_IS_A_TEST" not found

          %OA-E-BADLIB, Error occurred while precompiling THIS_IS_A.TEST
          form library

          You can ignore these messages as they are part of tests
          that are performed by the IVP.

          If any other error messages occur during the IVP, do the
          following:

          1. Check the log of the installation for any errors that
             may have occurred during installation.

          2. Check the file ALLIN1_IVP.LOG. This file does not
             contain the results of the IVP, but the results of
             invoking ALL-IN-1 when running the IVP. This file is
             in the directory where you run the installation.

              3. Check for any errors in the following procedures.

                 o  During the execution of the startup file,
                    SYS$STARTUP:A1V32START.COM:

                       Creating logical names

                 o  Automatic postinstallation procedures

                       Installing image files
                       Compiling and installing form libraries

              4. Make sure that the ALL-IN-1 TXL is compiled and
                 installed successfully, and recompile it if you received
                 any error messages when the postinstallation command
                 file was run.

              5. Check that you have not run out of quota on the disk(s)
                 containing the OA$SHAREnnnn directories (refer to the
                 manual describing OpenVMS utilities).

              6. Check that the details for the IVP account are completed
                 correctly, as follows:

                 o  All the ALL-IN-1 privileges are set to YES.

                 o  The IVP user directory points to the disk and
                    subdirectory that you specified for the ALL-IN-1
                    manager's account. For example:

                    a1device:[ALLIN1.IVPUSER]

                    where a1device is the device that you specified
                    during the installation.

                 o  The ALL-IN-1 account, IVP, is accessed from the
                    ALL-IN-1 manager's OpenVMS account.

              7. Run ALL-IN-1 and try to use those areas that failed
                 during the IVP to find more information on the error.

                 Log in to the ALL-IN-1 manager's IVP account:

                 $ ALLIN1 /USERNAME=IVP

                 Manually execute each IVP test as described in the
                 ALL-IN-1 Management Guide.

    4.5 Error Messages when Running the IVP



             ________________________ Note ________________________

             The IVP runs in the language context of the current
             optional language being installed and also tests the
             international base system.

             Most IVPs are designed to exercise and test ALL-
             IN-1 at a level which is normally customization-
             independent. However, if you have customized the Phone
             Directory subsystem of ALL-IN-1, the display graphics
             (IDG) procedure may fail. This is a demonstration test
             used to exercise the terminal graphics as a typical
             application.

             ______________________________________________________

    4.6 IVP Failure

          If the IVP fails, the following messages are displayed:

          The A1 V3.2 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

          %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for A1 V3.2 has failed.

              This chapter describes the tasks that you must do to
              complete the setup of ALL-IN-1. Some of these tasks are
              optional, or only apply to particular types of systems, or
              configurations.

              There are a number of additional setup tasks that the
              ALL-IN-1 manager must do to set up the users' working
              environment before ALL-IN-1 is used. These tasks are
              explained in detail in the  ALL-IN-1 Management Guide.

              You must run postinstallation from the node on which you
              are running ALL-IN-1.

        5.2 Start ALL-IN-1 on all Nodes in a VMScluster System

              The ALL-IN-1 startup procedure, SYS$STARTUP:A1V32START.COM,
              is supplied with ALL-IN-1 and is executed automatically on
              the node used for the installation, once the installation
              has completed successfully.

              If you are running ALL-IN-1 on a VMScluster you must also
              run SYS$STARTUP:A1V32START.COM on each node in the cluster
              in order to start ALL-IN-1. If you run A1V32START.COM
              manually from the DCL prompt, you must include the
              location of the ALL-IN-1 configuration file, OA$DATA_
              SHARE:A1CONFIG.DAT. OpenVMS prompts you for the location
              of this file if you do not specify it on the command line.

    5.2 Start ALL-IN-1 on all Nodes in a VMScluster System



          If you are creating new shared directories from within
          ALL-IN-1, you must define new system logical names on each
          node in the cluster. For further information about running
          ALL-IN-1 on a VMScluster, see Chapter 5 in the  ALL-IN-1
          Management Guide.

    5.3 Create or Modify the Site-specific ALL-IN-1 Startup Procedure

          To modify the ALL-IN-1 startup command procedure, you must
          create a site-specific command procedure. The site-specific
          startup command procedure will be automatically executed by
          the ALL-IN-1 startup command procedure when it is executed.

          You can create the following types of site-specific command
          procedures:

          o  A language-independent startup command procedure called
             A1V32_SITE_START.COM. Create this startup procedure in
             OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE_IND.

          o  A language-specific startup command procedure, OA$SITE_
             language_START.COM, for each language installed in
             a multilanguage ALL-IN-1 system. Create this startup
             procedure in OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_IND.

             device:[directory.SITE.SOURCES_language])

             where: device is the device containing the language
             files, and directory is the name of the top-level
             directory of your ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 system.

             You can specify the directory for your default language
             by using the logical name OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_IND.

          If you are upgrading and you have a site-specific startup
          command procedure that you want to keep, rename it from
          A1V31_SITE_START.COM to A1V32_SITE_START.COM.

          Check that the contents of the command file are still valid
          and required for ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2. Note the following
          changes:

          o  The OA$MTI_AREA logical is now defined in A1CONFIG

          o  The OA$A1_CLUSTER_NODE is now defined in A1CONFIG

                             5.4 Edit the Site-specific Startup Procedure



        5.4 Edit the Site-specific Startup Procedure

              When you run A1V32START.COM from the DCL prompt, you
              must include the location of the ALL-IN-1 configuration
              file, OA$DATA_SHARE:A1CONFIG.DAT. OpenVMS prompts you
              for the location of this file if you do not specify it
              on the command line. When you include the ALL-IN-1 startup
              procedure in the OpenVMS site startup procedure, you must
              specify the location of the A1CONFIG.DAT file:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:A1V32START.COM location

              where location is the location of A1CONFIG.DAT, which is
              specified as:

              device:[directory.DATA_SHARE]

              device is the device that you specified for the ALL-IN-1
              data files and directory is the top-level directory that
              you specified for the ALL-IN-1 data files.

              To find the location of OA$DATA_SHARE:A1CONFIG.DAT, refer
              to your installation log.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                However you choose to set up your site-specific
                startup procedures, you must ensure that all the
                ALL-IN-1 prerequisite products are started before
                ALL-IN-1. This includes messaging software, DEC Notes,
                and DECwindows/Motif if you are using CDA converters
                with ALL-IN-1.

        5.4.1 Installations With Digital X.500 and the MAILbus 400 MTA

              If you have installed a new ALL-IN-1 system with Digital
              X.500 and the MAILbus 400 MTA, you must ensure that
              the prerequisite messaging products are started before
              ALL-IN-1. Make sure that the following 3 files are executed
              in the following order:

              1. SYS$STARTUP:OSAK$START.COM

              2. SYS$STARTUP:DXD$COMMON_STARTUP.COM

    5.4.2 Installations with Message Router

          For ALL-IN-1 systems using Message Router, you must
          ensure that the Message Router software is started before
          ALL-IN-1.

          As an example, Table 5-2 describes how to edit the OpenVMS
          site-specific startup file to include the ALL-IN-1 startup
          procedure after an upgrade installation from ALL-IN-1
          Version 3.1. This ensures that the ALL-IN-1 environment
          is reestablished following a system reboot.

        5.5 Replace the DCLTABLES on Cluster Systems

              If you installed ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 on a VMScluster
              system, you must replace the DCLTABLES on any nodes in
              the cluster where you are not installing ALL-IN-1 Version
              3.2. Enter the following commands on each of these nodes:

              $ INSTALL
              INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES /OPEN /SHARE -
              _INSTALL> /HEADER_RES
              INSTALL> EXIT

              You need only do this once after you have installed
              ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2. The ALL-IN-1 installation procedure
              replaces the tables automatically for the node on which you
              are installing ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2.

        5.6 Delete Files That Are No Longer Required

              If you have upgraded or updated ALL-IN-1, various files
              remain in the SYSTEM directories which you can delete to
              increase your disk space. The files are:

              o  For an ALL-IN-1 Version 3.1 upgrade:

                    SYS$HELP:A1031.RELEASE_NOTES

    5.7 Install Missing Images

          On startup, if any error messages are displayed relating to
          images that are not installed, use the Install utility
          to install those images before executing the startup
          procedure again. Images that you may need to install in
          this way are those referenced by optional products that
          you have integrated with the ALL-IN-1 image. For example,
          the following command installs the image RDBSHR, which is
          referenced by VAX DATATRIEVE:

          $ INSTALL
          INSTALL> ADD SYS$SHARE:RDBSHR /OPEN /HEADER_RES /SHARED

          For more details of the Install Utility, see the OpenVMS
          documentation.

    5.8 Recompile Form Libraries

          If you are upgrading from ALL-IN-1 Version 3.1 and you have
          compiled form libraries on your old system which are not
          replaced by the upgrade, you may see the following error
          message:

          Obsolete form library <name> please recompile

          If you see this message, recompile the form library.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             You must also compile application or site-specific
             form libraries, and your own applications.

             ______________________________________________________

          The following form libraries are compiled automatically:

          o  OAFORM

          o  SITEOAFORM

          o  MEMRES

              If you have added code or manual procedures to compile
              other form libraries, you must recompile them manually
              after the installation. Use the Precompile a form library
              (PCF) option from the System Customization Management (CSZ)
              menu. See the  ALL-IN-1 Management Guide.

        5.9 Migrate SITELINK31 Using Customization Management

              The SITELINK32.COM file is under the control of
              Customization Management. It is important that you check
              that any customizations to SITELINK31.COM are compatible
              with SITELINK32.COM.

              Use Customization Management to edit the base template
              version of the site link file, SITELINK32.COM, to include
              your previous SITELINK31.COM from OA$SITE_BUILD. Review
              your customizations to SITELINK32.COM and then move your
              customized version to LIVE. Review your customizations
              to make sure they are compatible with ALL-IN-1 Version
              3.2. Do not relink ALL-IN-1 until you have done this. See
              Section 5.10.

              It is recommended that you do the following to relink:

              $ SET DEFAULT OA$BUILD_SHARE_ARCH
              $ @OA$BUILD:A1LNKDRV

        5.10 Migrating Your Customizations After Upgrading

              Immediately after installing ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2, and
              before allowing your users to access ALL-IN-1, review your
              customizations to mandatory elements.

              You can rerun the CART after installing ALL-IN-1 Version
              3.2 using the Check Conflicts (CC) option from the
              Application Maintenance menu. When you run the CART from
              within ALL-IN-1, it does not produce the site elements
              report. It does produce the full and summary reports, and
              the CART resolution procedure, which are all stored as new
              elements in Customization Management.

              If you rerun the CART, it does not keep the previous
              CART full and summary reports. To keep them, use the
              Customization Management Copy (CO) option to save the
              elements with another name in the same area, for example,
              copy CM_CART_SUMMARY_V32$PRIMARY to CM_CART_SUMMARY_

          V32$PRIMARY_19FEB. All of the elements that you have
          already processed will have status code F.

          To review your customizations:

          1. From the Customization Management (CM) subsystem, select
             each element marked as a mandatory change and print the
             differences between it and the new base element.

          2. Review the differences.

             Note where new functionality has been added or changes
             made. Note any symbol changes. Use the information in
             your upgrade plan to make the changes necessary to get
             your system running.

          3. Test your customizations and, if they work correctly,
             move the elements back into the live area.

          4. Before allowing your users back onto the system, review
             your customizations to recommended elements in the same
             way as you reviewed the mandatory elements.

             If you do not resolve conflicts to recommended elements,
             users may not have access to your customizations or will
             not have access to the full functionality of ALL-IN-1
             Version 3.2.

          5. Review conflicts with elements reported with status code
             D, see the  ALL-IN-1 Overview and Planning Guide. Status
             code D indicates a customization that calls an element
             which has been removed from ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2.

             If the element that is called by your customized element
             has a status code of A, then no customized version of
             it exists. Your customization will fail if you delete
             the removed element, as described in Section 5.10.2.
             Edit the command procedure DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM so
             that these elements are not deleted. See Section 5.10.2.
             Use Customization Management to create a new customized
             element to replace the referenced base element that no
             longer exists in ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2.

             Use Customization Management to copy any elements
             reported with status code A into the development area.
             When you rerun the CART, these elements will be reported
             with status code H.

              6. You can now allow your users to access ALL-IN-1 Version
                 3.2. When it is convenient, resolve the conflicts for
                 informational elements.

        5.10.1 Running the CART Resolution Procedure

              The CART resolution procedure calls individual scripts to
              process each status code. The scripts are called CM_CART_
              SCRIPTn, where n is the CART status code.

              To run and edit the scripts called by the CART resolution
              procedure, you must have Application Maintainer privileges
              for the areas where the elements are stored. See the
              ALL-IN-1 Management Guide. To run the CART resolution
              procedure use the Execute procedure (EP) option from the
              Application Maintainer's Check Conflicts (CC) menu.

              To change the way that the CART resolution procedure
              handles elements with a particular status code, do the
              following:

              1. Enter the Customization Management (CM) subsystem.

              2. Use the Access base element (ABE) option to select the
                 CART resolution script.

              3. Copy the script that you want to change into the
                 development area.

              4. Edit the script using Customization Management.

              It is not mandatory to use the CART resolution procedure
              to resolve conflicts. If the script does not provide
              appropriate actions to resolve the conflicts at your site,
              then you do not have to use it.

              You can use the CART resolution procedure to resolve some
              of the conflicts reported with an informational status
              code. You should review the CART resolution procedure
              carefully before running it. Check that your customized
              elements do not call a removed element, see Section 5.10
              which describes how to resolve conflicts for elements
              reported with status code D.

    5.10.2 Deleting Obsolete Files

          A command procedure, DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM, is provided
          to remove the files that are no longer required by ALL-IN-1
          Version 3.2.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Do not run this procedure immediately after running
             the CART resolution procedure. You must always review
             this file before running it. Check that all your
             customizations are working correctly and ensure that
             your customizations do not call any elements that will
             be deleted by this procedure.

             ______________________________________________________

          You can edit DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM to stop the deletion
          of certain files if required, for example, if one of your
          customizations calls an element that has been removed from
          the base kit and which would otherwise be deleted by this
          procedure.

          For example, the suggested resolution for elements with
          status code A is to:

          o  Run the CART resolution procedure to delete the records
             for these elements from the Customization Management
             databases

          o  Run the
             command procedure OA$LIB:DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM to
             delete the elements

          To run DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM, enter the following from
          DCL:

          $ @OA$LIB:DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM language

          where language is the language of the ALL-IN-1 system. If
          you have additional languages installed on your system, you
          can run this procedure for each additional languages.

        5.10.3 Restoring Customizations to Data Files

              Read this section if you copied customized data files
              according to the instructions in Section 1.8.1.

              Throughout this section, the form PROFILE.DAT is used as an
              example. To restore your modifications to your data files,
              do the following:

              1. Make a copy of the new base PROFILE.DAT file, preferably
                 outside the ALL-IN-1 directory structure:

                 $ COPY OA$DATA:PROFILE.DAT disk:[directory]BASE_PROFILE.DAT

              2. Make copies of the new base PROFILn forms using
                 Customization Management. For example, copy them to
                 BASE_PROFILn and modify the named data so that the .FILE
                 directive specifies the location of the backup copy of
                 the base format PROFILE file.

              3. Make the forms live.

              4. Use Customization Management to add your customizations
                 to the new base PROFILn forms and PROFILE.FDL.

              5. Make the forms and the FDL files live.

              6. Convert PROFILE.DAT to your customized format:

                 <OA$CNV_CONVERT BASE_PROFIL,PROFIL

              7. If it is necessary to recover some data from the
                 original customized PROFILE.DAT, write a script that
                 loops through the CUSTOM_PROFIL dataset and writes the
                 new data to the PROFIL dataset.

                 For example:

                 FOR CUSTOM_PROFIL DO WRITE CHANGE PROFIL -
                 %KEY = .%KEY, additional_field = .additional_field

        5.10.4 Replacing the Help Modules for Your Application

              For more information about customizing Help, see the
              Application Programming: Guide.

              After the upgrade, copy the ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2
              standard Help libraries, OA$LIB:OAHELP.HLB and
              OA$LIB:SITEHLPSOURCE.HLB from the base area to the live
              area, OA$SITE_LIB_language. Customization Management will
              inform you that the live and development versions of the

    5.10 Migrating Your Customizations After Upgrading



          Help libraries are the same and ask you whether you wish to
          continue. Answer yes to continue.

          You must recreate your customizations to Help modules using
          Customization Management. Use the Access base elements
          (ABE) option to get the base version of your Help module.
          Use the Copy (CO) option to copy the customized module to
          the development area where you can make changes to it. When
          you save the module ALL-IN-1 formats it and puts it into
          the appropriate development Help libraries. When you have
          tested the Help, mark it to be moved to the live area so
          that it can be used.

    5.11 Link ALL-IN-1 to Include Code-level Customizations

          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 is linked during the installation
          without any customizations you may have made to your
          existing system. Therefore, it is important to relink
          ALL-IN-1 after the installation if you wish to link with
          your customizations when you have checked them. See Chapter
          2 in the  ALL-IN-1 Management Guide.

    5.12 Check Entries in RIGHTSLIST.DAT

          OpenVMS usernames used with ALL-IN-1 must have
          corresponding entries with the same name in the
          RIGHTSLIST.DAT file, so that shared filing and system
          management can operate correctly. After upgrading to
          ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2, run the script OA$LIB:SM_CHECK_
          PROFILE, which generates a report indicating those accounts
          which may not conform to this requirement.

    5.13 Setting up Remote Mail When Using the MAILbus 400 MTA

          You must complete the set up tasks for Digital X.500 and
          the MAILbus 400 MTA before you can send and receive mail
          using the MAILbus 400 MTA. The setup tasks are covered in
          the Setting up a New System with the MAILbus 400 MTA and
          Digital X.500 chapter in the  ALL-IN-1 Mail Management
          Guide.

        5.14 Setting up Remote Mail When Using Message Router

              After the installation, local mail is already set up. If
              you want to use Message Router for remote mail, you may
              need to do some or all of the tasks listed in Table 5-3,
              depending on the requirements at your site.

              The tasks that you must do depend on the type of remote
              Message Router which can be:

              o  Installed on a VAX node in the same VMScluster:

                 -  With ALL-IN-1 installed on the Message Router node

                 -  Without ALL-IN-1 installed on the Message Router
                    node

              o  Installed on a VAX node that is not in the same
                 VMScluster as ALL-IN-1

              Task_______________________For_Information_See_____________

              If you are using a remote  Section 5.14.1
              Message Router server
              node, make sure that
              there is a mailbox entry
              on that node for your
              ALL-IN-1 mailbox.

              You may have already
              done this as part of your
              preinstallation tasks.

              If you have installed      Section 5.14.2
              ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2
              on a mixed architecture
              cluster, you must modify
              the mailbox entry on the
              Message Router node.

              If you are using MRGATE    Section 5.14.3
              on a remote node, set up
              each node that will be
              using MRGATE.

                   where:

                   o  localnode is the name of the ALL-IN-1 node or
                      cluster. The name must be unique to the Message
                      Router system.

                   o  password is the ALL-IN-1 mailbox password that you

    5.14.2 Modifying the Message Router Mailbox Entry

          You must modify the Message Router mailbox entry if you
          have a mixed-architecture cluster and you are using a
          Message Router in the same cluster. The installation
          procedure creates a mailbox entry on the Message Router
          node with the /OWNER=ALLIN1 qualifier. The Alpha node will
          be unable to connect with this mailbox because the /OWNER
          qualifier is on the mailbox. Modify the ALL-IN-1 mailbox
          entry on the Message Router node to remove the qualifier.

          $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:MBMAN
          MRM> MODIFY A1/NOOWNER
          MRM> EXIT

          where A1 is the name of the Message Router mailbox.

    5.14.3 Configuring the VMSmail Gateway for Remote Access

          If you have installed the Message Router VMSmail Gateway
          on one of the nodes in a VMScluster you can set up other
          ALL-IN-1 nodes so that they can access it.

          On each of the nodes that does not have the gateway
          started, define the logical name MRGATE to the following:

          node::MR%

          where node is the node where the gateway is running.

          You can also use a VMSmail Gateway on a node in your
          network, that is remote to your cluster. You need Message
          Router to be installed on one of the nodes in your cluster
          in order to do this. Make an entry for the remote VMSmail
          Gateway in the mailbox directory of the Message Router
          Transfer Service on the VAX node in your cluster that is
          running Message Router:

          1. Log in to the MBMANAGER account on the VAX node in your
             cluster that is running Message Router

          2. Enter the following commands:

             $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:MRMAN
             MRM> ADD MRGATE/REPLACE="MRGATE @node"

             where node is the node where the gateway is installed.

        5.14.4 Setting Up the Message Router Directory Service as the
               Mail Directory

              The tasks that you need to do depend on the following:

              o  If the Message Router node is in the same VMScluster and
                 has ALL-IN-1 installed, see Section 5.14.4.1.

              o  If the Message Router node is not in the same VMScluster
                 or ALL-IN-1 is not installed on the Message Router node,
                 see Section 5.14.4.2.

        5.14.4.1 Message Router is in the Same VMScluster

              Read this section if ALL-IN-1 is installed in the same
              VMScluster as Message Router and ALL-IN-1 is installed
              on the Message Router node. You can be using the Mail
              directory as either the primary or the secondary directory.
              If, during the installation, you chose to use the Mail
              directory as the primary directory, OA$DDS_PRIME is set to
              2. If, during the installation, you chose to use the Mail
              directory as the secondary directory with ALL-IN-1 as the
              primary directory, then OA$DDS_PRIME is set to 1.

              After installation, the following values are set up:

              o  A user agent entry name and password.

                 -  The user agent entry name is OA$node$ALLIN1 for a
                    new or upgrade installation, where node is either
                    the node name or the cluster alias for the system
                    on which you are installing ALL-IN-1. For example,
                    OA$LYNX$ALLIN1.

                 -  The user agent entry password is the Mail directory
                    password that you entered during the installation.

              o  A subscriber entry for the ALL-IN-1 manager. The proxy
                 attribute of the subscriber entry is the name of the
                 local ALL-IN-1 user agent entry (OA$node$ALLIN1). This

                  the subscriber entry into the manager's ALL-IN-1
                  account details.

               o  Updates the ALL-IN-1 user agent object in the
                  Mail directory with the values you supplied for
                  organization name and location.

               o  Creates a mail address (OA$DDS_AREA_ROUTE) that is
                  used for all the Mail directory subscribers owned
                  by the user agent ( ALL-IN-1). The mail address
                  comprises the name of the ALL-IN-1 Message Router
                  mailbox (OA$MTI_MAILBX), and the name of the node
                  or cluster (OA$PRIMARY_NODE) running the Message
                  Router to be used by ALL-IN-1. If area routing
                  is in use at your site, the network address also

              Read this section if the Message Router that you are using
              is not in the same VMScluster as ALL-IN-1, or it is in
              the same VMScluster but ALL-IN-1 is not installed on the
              Message Router Node.

              You must create the following:

              o  A user agent entry name and password.

              o  A subscriber entry for the ALL-IN-1 manager. The proxy
                 attribute of the subscriber entry is the name of the
                 local ALL-IN-1 user agent entry (OA$node$ALLIN1). This
                 attribute gives ALL-IN-1 proxy access to the manager's
                 entry, so that ALL-IN-1 can update and access the entry.

              o  Update the OA$DATA_SHARE:UAPASSWRD.DAT file with the
                 name of the user agent object and password.

              You must do some tasks on the remote Message Router node
              and some tasks on the ALL-IN-1 node.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             To use the converted documents in ALL-IN-1, the
             WPS-PLUS editor must be installed.

             ______________________________________________________

          To convert WPS-PLUS for VMS documents, do the following:

          1. Give each ALL-IN-1 user who wants to convert their
             WPS-PLUS for VMS documents the ALL-IN-1 DCL and CMD
             privileges. See the  ALL-IN-1 Management Guide for
             details of setting these privileges. If you normally
             restrict this access, reset it after conversion is
             complete.

          2. Check that the directory containing the WPS-PLUS for VMS
             File Cabinet exists by entering the following command:

             $ DIRECTORY /PROTECTION disk:[username.WPSPLUS...]*.*

             where disk is the name of the user's OpenVMS disk and
             username is the OpenVMS username

             This command lists all the files in the WPS-PLUS for VMS
             account belonging to the user.

          3. Make sure that all files have the following minimum
             protection:

             (S:RWD,O:RWE,,)

          4. Run ALL-IN-1 from the user account.

          5. Enter WP to display the Word and Document Processing
             menu.

          6. Enter the following command:

             <DO OA$LIB:WPCOPY

          7. Enter the full directory specification of
             the WPS-PLUS for VMS directory (for example,
             DISK1:[HUDSON.WPSPLUS]) at the following prompt:

             Enter directory of old File Cabinet

          8. Enter the full directory specification of the ALL-IN-1
             directory (for example, DISK1:[HUDSON.A1]) at the

        5.16 WPS-PLUS Login Command Procedure

              During the ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 installation procedure, a
              login command procedure, A1WPSPLUS_LOGIN.COM, is created
              in SYS$MANAGER. Add this to the system login command
              procedure, SYS$SYLOGIN, if you want all users to run
              with these qualifiers. Alternately, you can make the file
              available to users to put into their own LOGIN.COM files.

    5.17 Install the File Cabinet Server Distributed License



    5.17 Install the File Cabinet Server Distributed License

          The File Cabinet server handles access to the File Cabinet
          over the network. If you want to give remote users access
          to your node, you need the A1-DIST-SHR license. The A1-
          DIST-SHR license enables the File Cabinet server on your
          system to accept connections from a File Cabinet server on
          a remote system. You also need this license if you want to
          use the ALL-IN-1 Web Interface to make documents in your
          File Cabinet available to users of Web Browsers.

          Use the License Management Facility (LMF) to install the
          A1-DIST-SHR license. For information about LMF, see the LMF
          documentation. See Chapter 9 in the  ALL-IN-1 Management
          Guide for more information about distributed sharing.

    5.18 Moving the CDA DOC_STYLE Files

          If CDA$LIBRARY does not exist on your system, the CDA DOC_
          STYLE files are installed in OA$LIB_SHARE. Move the files
          to a suitable location.

    5.19 Update the Facility Definition to Use DECtrace

          During the installation of ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2, a
          Facility Definition file for DECtrace is provided to
          SYS$SHARE:EPC$FACILITY.TLB. If you install DECtrace after
          you have installed ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2, the Facility
          Definition is picked up automatically.

                      5.19 Update the Facility Definition to Use DECtrace



              If DECtrace is already installed on your system, and you
              wish to use it for collecting information about ALL-IN-1
              Version 3.2, you must update the Facility Definition as
              follows:

              $ LIBRARY/TEXT/EXTRACT=OAV32/OUTPUT=EPC$A1V32-FAC-DEF.EPC$DEF -
                         SYS$SHARE:EPC$FACILITY.TLB
              $ COLLECT INSERT DEFINITION EPC$A1V32-FAC-DEF.EPC$DEF/REPLACE

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The Facility Definition File has not been updated for
                ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2. It is the same as provided in
                ALL-IN-1 Version 3.1.

                                  ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 Distribution Media


              The ALL-IN-1 kit is provided on its own CD-ROM or as part
              of the CD-ROM Consolidated Software Distribution. For VAX
              upgrades, the kit is also available on magnetic tape and
              TK50. The same ALL-IN-1 savesets are provided on all media.

              A separate CD-ROM is provided for the ALL-IN-1 Web
              Interface product.

        A.1 CD-ROM Distribution Kits (VAX or Alpha Installations)

              The notes in this section apply to both the ALL-IN-1
              Version 3.2 CD-ROM and to the Consolidated Software
              Distribution CD-ROM. On the Compact Disc (CD-ROM), the
              base kit is in the directory A1032.KIT. The printable
              documentation is in a directory called A1032.DOCUMENTATION.

              For the ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 CD-ROM, the online versions
              of the documentation for Bookreader are provided in the
              DECW$BOOK directory.

              For each language, there is a directory called A1lang032,
              where lang is the 2-letter code for the ALL-IN-1 language
              that you are installing. See the  ALL-IN-1 Installation:
              Language and Market Supplement for a list of savesets for
              your language, market and dialect components.

              The base component savesets in the A1032.KIT directory are:

                               ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 Files and Directories


              This appendix lists the files that are installed in
              directories other than the ALL-IN-1 directories.

        B.1 Files in the ALL-IN-1 Kit

              For a complete list of all ALL-IN-1 directories and file
              names when the installation is complete, use the following
              command for each ALL-IN-1 area:

              $ DIR/SEC[a1dir...]*.*/out=a1dir.TXT

              where a1dir is the top level directory name for each area
              (for example ALLIN1.DIR).

              The list of files is a useful reference if you need to
              resolve any problems with file protections or ACLs.

        B.2 Files Installed in Non-ALL-IN-1 Directories

              The following list shows the files that are installed in
              directories other than the ALL-IN-1 directories. Where
              language is included in a file name, this is the name of
              the installed language, for example, ENGLISH.
