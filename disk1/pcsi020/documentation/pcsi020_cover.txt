          OpenVMS VAX

          May 2000

          Dear OpenVMS Customer,

          The VMS62TO71_PCSI V2.0 remedial kit updates the POLYCENTER
          Software Installation utility for OpenVMS VAX, including asso-
          ciated command procedures and help text. After installation of
          this kit, the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility will be
          functionally equivalent to that provided by OpenVMS VAX V7.2
          with the addition of several corrections to the utility. The
          file name of the kit is DEC-VAXVMS-VMS62TO71_PCSI-V0200-4.PCSI.

          This remedial kit can be applied to OpenVMS VAX V6.2 and V7.1
          systems. To install it, enter a command similar to the follow-
          ing:

             $ PRODUCT INSTALL VMS62TO71_PCSI /SOURCE=dev:[dir]

          No reboot is required after successful installation of this kit.
          However, you will need to log out and then log on again before
          using the PRODUCT command.

          For more information about this remedial kit, please read the
          release notes. The release notes are placed in SYS$HELP: during
          installation, but you can extract the file from the remedial
          kit for viewing prior to installation. To copy the release notes
          from the kit to your default directory, enter a command similar
          to the following:

             $ PRODUCT EXTRACT RELEASE_NOTES VMS62TO71_PCSI /SOURCE=dev:[dir]

          Important Note About Reverting to Prior Versions

          After installaton of this remedial kit your system will use
          the new features provided by this version of the POLYCENTER
          Software Installation utility. If a layered product is installed
          that makes use of this new functionality, then it may not be
          possible to revert back to an older version of the utility. This
          restriction occurs because there may be records in the software
          product database that the older version of the utility will not
          be able to interpret.
