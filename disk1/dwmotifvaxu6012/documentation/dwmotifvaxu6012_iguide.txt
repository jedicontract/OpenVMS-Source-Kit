        Conventions

              Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha contains a
              graphical user interface that is derived from the Common
              Desktop Environment (CDE). This interface is referred to
              throughout this document as the New Desktop.

              VMScluster systems are now referred to as OpenVMS Cluster
              systems. Unless otherwise specified, references to OpenVMS
              Clusters or clusters in this document are synonymous with
              VMSclusters.

              In this manual, every use of DECwindows and DECwindows
              Motif refers to Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
              software.

              The following conventions are also used in this manual:

              Ctrl/x           A sequence such as Ctrl/x indicates that
                               you must hold down the key labeled Ctrl
                               while you press another key or a pointing
                               device button.

              <Return>         In examples, a key name enclosed in a
                               box indicates that you press a key on
                               the keyboard. (In text, a key name is not
                               enclosed in a box.)

                               In the HTML version of this document, this
                               convention appears as brackets, rather
                               than a box.

          .                omission of items from a code example
          .                or command format; the items are omitted
                           because they are not important to the
                           topic being discussed.

          ( )              In command format descriptions,
                           parentheses indicate that you must enclose
                           the choices in parentheses if you choose
                           more than one.

          [ ]              In command format descriptions, brackets
                           indicate optional elements. You can
                           choose one, none, or all of the options.

    1.1 License Registration

          Before you install and run Compaq DECwindows Motif for
          OpenVMS software on a newly licensed node or cluster,
          you must first register a License Product Authorization
          Key (License PAK) using the License Management Facility
          (LMF). The License PAK is provided along with the kit if
          you ordered the license and media together; otherwise, it
          is provided separately to a location based on your license
          order.

          If you are installing Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
          software as an update on a node or cluster already licensed
          for this software, you have already completed the License
          PAK registration requirements.

          You must register and load your license for Compaq
          DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS before you run the
          Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and use the
          software.

          To register a license, log in to the system manager account
          (SYSTEM). Then choose one of the following options to
          register the license:

          o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When the
             procedure prompts you for information, respond with data
             from your License PAK.

          o  At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command
             with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to
             License PAK information.

          If you plan to use Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
          software on more than one node in a VMScluster, load
          the license on the other nodes after you complete this
          installation.

          For complete information about using LMF, see the OpenVMS
          License Management Utility Manual.

              If your system is not running one of these versions before
              you attempt to install Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS,
              the installation fails.

                                                                      1-3

 



    Preparing to Install the Software
    1.4 Required Operating System Software


          A minimum of 16 MB of memory is required for OpenVMS VAX
          systems; 32 MB of memory is highly recommended. A minimum
          of 64 MB of memory is required for OpenVMS Alpha systems;
          at least 128 MB of memory is highly recommended.

          The OpenVMS operating system provides two subsets of
          components to support Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS.
          To use Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software, your
          system should be running a version of the OpenVMS system
          that includes the following components:

          o  DECwindows Motif transports and base system support

             This support is required to install Compaq DECwindows
             Motif for OpenVMS and to run Compaq DECwindows Motif
             for OpenVMS applications. During the installation of
             OpenVMS, you are prompted to specify whether you want to
             install this option.

             To determine whether this option was installed during
             the installation of OpenVMS, enter the following
             command:

             $ DIR SYS$LIBRARY:DECW$TRANSPORT_COMMON.EXE

             See Section 5.3 for information on adding DECwindows
             base support files after OpenVMS has been installed.

          o  DECwindows X11 display server for OpenVMS, fonts, and
             device drivers, which are necessary to display Compaq
             DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS applications or any other
             X11 applications on your Alpha or VAX system

             During the installation of OpenVMS, you are prompted to
             specify whether you want to install this option.

             To determine whether this option was installed during
             the installation of OpenVMS, enter the following
             command:

             $ DIR SYS$SYSTEM:DECW$SERVER_MAIN.EXE

             If the DECW$SERVER_MAIN.EXE file is not on your system,
             you cannot display Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
             applications on your Alpha or VAX system. However, you
             can run Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS applications
             that display on a DECwindows X11 display server that
             runs on another system. The Compaq DECwindows Motif for

                 continue the installation without workstation support.

                 See Section 5.3 for information on adding DECwindows
                 device support files and 75- or 100-dpi font files after
                 OpenVMS has been installed.

    1.5 Required ECO for POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility


    1.5 Required ECO for POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility

          If you are installing the Compaq DECwindows Motif for
          OpenVMS software on an OpenVMS Version 6.2 or 7.1 system,
          you must first install an ECO to the POLYCENTER Software
          Installation (PCSI) utility. See the Guide to the Compaq
          DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS CD-ROM for details about
          this ECO. OpenVMS Versions 7.2 and higher include this
          functionality in the operating system; therefore, you need
          not apply this ECO if you are running OpenVMS Version 7.2
          or higher.

          The following example shows a PCSI ECO installation on an

            1.5 Required ECO for POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility


        1.5.1 Upgrade Problem After Installing Required PCSI ECO

              After installing the required POLYCENTER Software
              Installation utility ECO, your system will use the new
              features provided by this version of the PCSI utility.
              If a layered product is installed that makes use of this
              new functionality, then it may not be possible to revert
              back to an older version of the utility. The restriction
              occurs because there may be records in the software product
              database that the older version of the utility will not be
              able to interpret.

              This scenario occurs if you install the PCSI ECO, then
              install DECwindows Motif, and later install certain
              upgrades to the OpenVMS operating system. The steps below
              describe the situations when this will occur:

              1. Install the PCSI ECO kit onto OpenVMS Version 6.2, 6.2-
                 1H1, 6.2-1H2, 6.2-1H3, 7.1, 7.1-1H1, or 7.1-1H2.

              2. Install DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-6.

              3. Upgrade to (or reinstall) OpenVMS Version 6.2, 6.2-1H1,
                 6.2-1H2, 6.2-1H3, 7.1, 7.1-1H1, or 7.1-1H2.

              Upgrading to any of the OpenVMS versions listed in item
              3 may fail (or other PRODUCT command operations on the
              product database may fail) with one of the following
              errors:

              %SYSTEM-F-ACCVIO, access violation, ...
              %PCSI-E-UNSDOCENC, unsupported product document encoding version

              To prevent these failures after installing the PCSI ECO and
              DECwindows Motif, perform the following steps:

              1. Remove DECwindows Motif using the following command:

                 $ PRODUCT REMOVE DWMOTIF

              2. Upgrade to (or reinstall) OpenVMS Version 6.2, 6.2-1H1,
                 6.2-1H2, 6.2-1H3, 7.1, 7.1-1H1, or 7.1-1H2.

              3. Reinstall the PCSI ECO.

              4. Reinstall DECwindows Motif.

                                                                      1-7

 



    Preparing to Install the Software
    1.5 Required ECO for POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility


          This workaround is not needed if you upgrading to OpenVMS
          Alpha Version 7.2-1 or higher, or if you are upgrading to
          OpenVMS VAX Version 7.2 or higher. These versions (and all
          later versions) already include the new functionality added
          by the PCSI ECO.

    1.6 OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 and XUI Programming Support

          The X Window and OSF/Motif libraries that are provided
          with Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software are
          incompatible with those libraries provided with versions
          of DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS prior to Version 1.2. Run-
          time compatibility is preserved, but the earlier OSF/Motif
          Release 1.1.3 and XUI programming environments are not
          compatible with the later OSF/MOTIF Release 1.2 programming
          environment.

          Programming in the XUI and OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3
          environments that was provided in previous versions of
          DECwindows Motif is no longer supported in the Compaq
          DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS product. However, the
          installation procedure gives you the option of saving the
          XUI and OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 programming files that
          already exist on your system. If you choose to save these
          programming files, they are moved to subdirectories where
          you can access them for programming. Specifically, the
          installation creates a subdirectory called [.DECW$113] in
          each of the directories listed in Table 1-1 and moves the
          previous files into the new [.DECW$113] subdirectory.

        1.7 Saving Customized Bookreader Files

              The installation procedure replaces the following file with
              a new version:

              SYS$SYSROOT:[DECW$BOOK]LIBRARY.DECW$BOOKSHELF

              If you customized this file and want to save it, copy the
              file to another directory or rename the file prior to
              the installation of Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
              software so that it is not deleted.

              To copy your customized file to another directory, create
              the directory and define a global symbol in the file
              DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.COM.

              To create a Bookreader directory called
              SYS$COMMON:[DECW$BOOK_LOCAL], perform the following steps:

              1. Create the directory and assign world read access as
                 follows:

                 $ CREATE/DIRECTORY/PROTECTION=WORLD:R -
                 _$ SYS$COMMON:[DECW$BOOK_LOCAL]

                                                                      1-9

 



    Preparing to Install the Software
    1.7 Saving Customized Bookreader Files


          2. Copy the LIBRARY.DECW$BOOKSHELF file to the new
             directory as follows:

             $ COPY SYS$SYSROOT:[DECW$BOOK]LIBRARY.DECW$BOOKSHELF -
             _$ SYS$COMMON:[DECW$BOOK_LOCAL]*/LOG

          3. If the SYS$MANAGER directory does not contain the
             DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.COM command file, copy the
             template file to a command file as follows:

             $ COPY SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.TEMPLATE -
             _$ SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.COM/LOG

          4. Edit the DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.COM file and define
             the global symbol DECW$BOOK to point to your Bookreader
             directory by adding the following line to the file:

             $ DECW$BOOK == "SYS$COMMON:[DECW$BOOK_LOCAL]"

          5. Restart DECwindows Motif using the following command if
             you performed step 4 after installing the product and
             after DECwindows had been started (for example, after a
             reboot):

             $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP RESTART

          For more information about customizing your DECwindows
          Motif environment, see Managing DECwindows Motif for
          OpenVMS Systems.

    1.8 Installation Procedure Requirements

          This section discusses the requirements for installing the
          Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software using PCSI and
          the VMSINSTAL installation procedure.

          The installation procedure checks the following:

          o  Whether you are logged in to an appropriately privileged
             account (VMSINSTAL installations only)

          o  Whether any other users are logged in to the system

          o  Whether you have the minimum required system account
             quotas and limits

          o  Whether you have the minimum required disk space

          o  Whether you have the minimum required system parameter
             values

              See Section 3.1 for information on requirements specific to
              VMSINSTAL installations.

        1.8.1 Process Account Quotas

              The installation procedure requires that the installation
              account has the minimum quotas shown in Table 1-2.

              Table_1-2_Process_Quotas_for_the_Installation_Account______

              Quota_Name__Alpha_Value___VAX_Value________________________

              FILLM__________100____________20___________________________

              Use the OpenVMS AUTHORIZE utility to verify and to change
              process quotas for the installation account in the user
              authorization file (UAF). (Some sites may restrict the use
              of the AUTHORIZE utility to certain accounts or users.)
              For example, to change the BYTLM quota for the account-name
              installation account, enter the following commands:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE
              UAF> SHOW account-name
              UAF> MODIFY account-name /BYTLM = 32768
              UAF> SHOW account-name
              UAF> EXIT
              $ LOGOUT

              After you change the quotas for the installation account,
              log out of the installation account and log in again for
              the new quotas to take effect. You can then proceed with
              the installation.

              User account quotas are stored in the file
              SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT. For more information about modifying
              account quotas, see the description of the AUTHORIZE
              utility in the OpenVMS System Management Utilities
              Reference Manual.

                                                                     1-11

    1.8 Installation Procedure Requirements


    1.8.2 Disk Space

          Use Table 1-3 to determine the amount of free disk space
          that is required on the system disk to install DECwindows
          Motif components. However, because you can choose not
          to install all the components, your actual disk space
          requirement may be less.

          To determine the number of free blocks on the system disk,
          enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

          $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

          The installation procedure checks for free disk space on
          the system disk. If sufficient space is not available, the
          installation procedure provides the following options:

          o  Install fewer optional files.

          o  For VMSINSTAL installations, restart the installation
             and specify another disk to use as an alternate working
             device. See Section 3.1.2 for information about using an
             alternate working device.

          o  Terminate the installation, create more free disk space
             on the system disk, and restart the installation.

          o  Continue the installation and risk running out of disk
             space.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             If you run out of free disk space during the
             installation, the installation procedure fails.

    1.8.4 Additional System Maintenance Procedures

          This section explains how to use the System Generation
          utility (SYSGEN) and the AUTOGEN utility to prepare
          your system for the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
          installation. The AUTOGEN utility uses system configuration
          data to automatically set system parameters.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             The DECwindows Motif installation and startup
             procedures automatically check for required system
             parameter values and pass the appropriate values to
             AUTOGEN. Therefore, in most cases you do not have to
             check and modify these values manually.

                                  1.8 Installation Procedure Requirements


        1.8.4.1 Checking System Parameter Values

              To check the values of your system parameters, invoke the
              SYSGEN utility by entering the following command at the DCL
              prompt:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN>

              At the SYSGEN prompt, enter the SHOW command to display the
              value of a system parameter. The following command displays
              the value for the MAXBUF system parameter:

              SYSGEN> SHOW MAXBUF

              After checking the parameters with the SHOW command, enter
              the EXIT command at the SYSGEN prompt to return to DCL
              level.

              If the current values are less than the values in
              Table 1-4, increase the system parameter settings.
              Section 1.8.4.4 describes the procedures for using the
              AUTOGEN utility to increase these values.

        1.8.4.2 Calculating the Number of Free Global Pages and Global
                Sections

              If your system parameter values are equal to or greater
              than the minimum values specified in Table 1-4, you can
              continue with the product installation. However, to install
              and run Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software,
              you must have sufficient free global pages and global
              sections for the DECwindows Motif software and the file
              SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE.

              First, determine how many free global pages and global
              sections exist on your system and how many are required
              to reinstall a new version of SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE.
              Then, if necessary, use the AUTOGEN utility to increase the
              values of the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS system parameters.

              Enter the following DCL command to determine the number of
              global pages required for SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE:

              $ DIR/SIZE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE

              This command returns the size (in blocks) of the file
              SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE. As an approximation, use this
              figure as the number of global pages needed for the file.

                                                                     1-17

 



    Preparing to Install the Software
    1.8 Installation Procedure Requirements


          Enter the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical function
          to find the number of contiguous free global pages and the
          number of free global sections. The following example shows
          how to obtain this information at your terminal, which is
          the default for SYS$OUTPUT:

          $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("CONTIG_GBLPAGES") <Return>
          15848
          $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS") <Return>
          24

          See Table 1-5 to determine whether the number of contiguous
          free global pages and the number of free global sections is
          sufficient. If these values are not sufficient to continue
          with the installation, then see Section 1.8.4.4, which
          describes the procedures for increasing these values using
          the AUTOGEN utility.

    1.8.4.3 Setting the Size of the Page File

          In order for DECwindows Motif to run with acceptable
          performance, the page file must be large enough to handle
          the virtual memory requirements of your system. The optimal
          size of the page file depends on many factors, such as the
          amount of physical memory on the system and the application
          work load.

    1-18

 



                                        Preparing to Install the Software
                                  1.8 Installation Procedure Requirements


              As a general rule, the page file size should be at least
              75,000 blocks on OpenVMS Alpha systems and 50,000 blocks on
              OpenVMS VAX systems. However, these sizes may be too small
              on systems where a large number of applications are run. On
              a heavily loaded system it may be possible to achieve large
              performance improvements by increasing the size of the page
              file by a factor of two or more.

              Normally you should run AUTOGEN with feedback and let
              AUTOGEN calculate the size of the page file based on the
              usage pattern on your system. To run AUTOGEN with feedback,
              enter the following DCL command:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN SAVPARAMS REBOOT FEEDBACK

              You can also increase the size of the page file by running
              the SYSGEN utility or by invoking the command procedure
              SYS$UPDATE:SWAPFILES.COM.

              For more information about setting the size of the page
              file and running AUTOGEN, see the Guide to Setting Up an
              OpenVMS System. For more information about performance
              tuning in general, see the Guide to OpenVMS Performance
              Management.

        1.8.4.4 Changing System Parameter Values Using the AUTOGEN
                Utility

              Use the AUTOGEN utility to change system parameters.
              AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for parameters that
              are associated with the values you reset manually. To
              change system parameters with AUTOGEN, edit the file
              SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT.

              To change a parameter value listed in this file, delete the
              current value associated with that parameter and enter the
              new value.

              To add a new parameter, add a line to the file and include
              both the name of the parameter and its value. For example:

              MIN_MAXBUF = 8192

              To make incremental adjustments to parameters, such as
              global pages and global sections, use ADD_. The following
              example increases the global pages value by 30,000:

              ADD_GBLPAGES = 30000

                                                                     1-19

          Table 1-6 lists the system parameters that you need to
          adjust incrementally.

          PAGEDYN__________180,000_______100,000_____________________

          After you enter all your changes, exit from the file and
          execute the AUTOGEN utility to recalculate your system
          parameters. Enter the following command to recalculate your
          system parameters and reboot the system:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

          When you specify REBOOT, the AUTOGEN utility performs an
          automatic system shutdown and then reboots the system. Any
          users logged in to the system are immediately disconnected
          during the shutdown. The automatic reboot puts the new
          parameter values into effect.

          For details about using AUTOGEN, see the section about the
          AUTOGEN utility in the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual and
          the AUTOGEN section in OpenVMS System Management Utilities
          Reference Manual.

    1.8.5 Backing Up Your System Disk

          Compaq recommends that you back up your system disk
          before you install any software. At the beginning of the
          installation, the installation procedure asks whether
          your system disk is backed up. Use the backup procedures
          that are established at your site. For details about
          performing a system disk backup, see the section on the
          Backup utility in the OpenVMS System Management Utilities
          Reference Manual.

        1.8.6 Notifying Other Users

              Inform users on the system that you plan to install a
              product and that they must log out during the installation.
              To make sure that you are the only user logged in to the
              system, follow these steps:

              1. Notify current users to log out. Enter the following
                 command at the DCL prompt:

                 $ REPLY/ALL/BELL/SHUTDOWN "Log out for the installation of -
                 _$ Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS, Version 1.2--6 please..."

              2. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt to prevent
                 nonprivileged users from logging in to the system:

                 $ SET LOGINS/INTERACTIVE=0

              If possible, give users an estimated time when they can log
              in to the system again.

          The sections that follow take you through the stages
          of installing your Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
          software using the POLYCENTER Software Installation
          utility. The installation procedure is nearly identical
          on Alpha and VAX systems.

          Refer to Chapter 1 for information about account quotas,
          disk space, and system parameters.

          Refer to the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual for complete
          information about responding to questions that the
          POLYCENTER Software Installation utility asks during
          product installation. For example, when you respond to
          questions, you can do the following:

          o  Enter a value and press the Return key to select
             options.

                 After you respond to questions by selecting options
                 or accepting default values, the installation utility
                 displays a summary of your answers.

                 Then a question is displayed asking whether you are
                 satisfied with your answers and whether you want to
                 continue with the installation. If you decide to change
                 your responses, type No and press the Return key. You
                 can then either reenter your responses or answer No and
                 exit from the installation utility.

              o  Stop the installation by pressing Ctrl/Y.

                 Note that this option is not recommended.

    2.3.2.1 Verifying Sufficient Allocation for the GBLPAGES and
            CLISYMTBL Values

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             If you are simultaneously installing or upgrading the
             OpenVMS operating system with DECwindows from the CD-
             ROM, the installation procedure will continue without

                checking your system values. It will check after the
                installation is complete (see Section 2.5).

                ______________________________________________________

              The installation command procedure checks to ensure that
              adequate values are allocated for GBLPAGES, CLISYMTBL, and
              NPAGEDYN system parameters:

              o  On OpenVMS Alpha systems, the minimum value for the
                 GBLPAGES system parameter is 150,000; on OpenVMS VAX
                 systems, the minimum value is 62,000.

              o  On OpenVMS Alpha systems, the minimum value for the
                 CLISYMTBL system parameter is 512; on OpenVMS VAX
                 systems, the minimum value is 256.

              o  On OpenVMS Alpha systems, the minimum value for the
                 NPAGEDYN system parameter is 1,998,848; on OpenVMS VAX
                 systems, the minimum value is 999,936.

              If your system values are sufficient, the installation
              procedure continues. If the values are insufficient, the
              procedure abandons the installation and instructs you to
              run AUTOGEN and then restart the installation. On OpenVMS
              Alpha systems, the procedure displays a message similar to
              the following:

        Checking values of system parameters...

        %DECW-W-BADVALUE, SYSGEN parameter GBLPAGES is 120000, should be at least 150000
        %DECW-W-BADVALUE, SYSGEN parameter NPAGEDYN is 1294336, should be at least 1998848
        %DECW-W-BADVALUE, SYSGEN parameter CLISYMTBL is 265, should be at least 512

          The installation procedure has determined that some system parameter values
          require modification to install the DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-6 for
          OpenVMS software.

          Please type the following command to run AUTOGEN and reboot your system
          before restarting the DECwindows installation.  This will set the system
          parameters to appropriate values for running DECwindows Motif V1.2-6.

                @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT CHECK_FEEDBACK

        The DECwindows installation is being terminated.

        Please run AUTOGEN and restart the installation.

                                                                      2-7

    %PCSIUI-E-ABORT, operation terminated due to an unrecoverable error condition

          A similar message is displayed on OpenVMS VAX systems.

    2.3.2.2 Running AUTOGEN

          If the installation procedure has prompted you to run
          AUTOGEN to correct your system values, enter the following
          command:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT CHECK_FEEDBACK

          The system runs AUTOGEN and produces a log similar to the
          following example:

    %AUTOGEN-I-BEGIN, GETDATA phase is beginning.
    %AUTOGEN-I-NEWFILE,  Previous contents of SYS$SYSTEM:CLU$PARAMS.DAT have
      been copied to SYS$SYSTEM:CLU$PARAMS.OLD.  You may wish to purge
      SYS$SYSTEM:CLU$PARAMS.OLD.
    %AUTOGEN-I-NEWFILE, A new version of SYS$SYSTEM:PARAMS.DAT has been created.
            You may wish to purge this file.
    %AUTOGEN-I-END, GETDATA phase has successfully completed.
    %AUTOGEN-I-BEGIN, GENPARAMS phase is beginning.
    %AUTOGEN-I-NEWFILE, A new version of SYS$MANAGER:VMSIMAGES.DAT has been created.
            You may wish to purge this file.
    %AUTOGEN-I-NEWFILE, A new version of SYS$SYSTEM:SETPARAMS.DAT has been created.
            You may wish to purge this file.
    %AUTOGEN-I-END, GENPARAMS phase has successfully completed.
    %AUTOGEN-I-BEGIN, GENFILES phase is beginning.

    %AUTOGEN-I-REPORT, AUTOGEN has produced some informational messages which
            have been stored in the file SYS$SYSTEM:AGEN$PARAMS.REPORT.  You may
            wish to review the information in that file.

              You can now restart the installation procedure (see
              Section 2.3.1).

        2.3.2.3 Saving the Programming Environment

              The installation procedure checks whether the OSF/Motif
              Release 1.1.3 programming environment exists on your
              system. If it is present, the installation procedure
              displays the following information and asks whether you
              want to save the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 programming
              environment:

              The DECwindows Motif programming environment was installed with a
              previous version of this kit. This environment is incompatible with the
              OSF/Motif Release 1.2 environment provided with DECwindows Motif Version
              1.2-6. The XUI programming environment is also not included in
              DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-6.

              If you intend to continue developing programs for XUI or OSF/Motif
              Release 1.1.3, then save this environment.  Please refer to the
              installation guide for more details and information on accessing these
              files in their new location.

              If you do not choose to save the XUI and OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3
              programming environment, those files will be removed from the system
              disk.

              Save the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 and XUI programming environment?

              If you answer Yes and press the Return key to save the
              OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 and XUI programming environment,
              a subdirectory called [.DECW$113] is created. The files
              that support that programming environment are moved to the
              [.DECW$113] subdirectory.

              If you answer No and press the Return key, the files are
              deleted.

              Refer to Section 1.6 for information about accessing
              files related to the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 programming
              environment.

              Note that this portion of the installation does not occur
              if you are simultaneously installing or upgrading the
              OpenVMS operating system with DECwindows.

                                                                      2-9

          Next, the dialog asks if you want the default installation.
          On systems with no previous DECwindows Motif installation,
          the installation procedure installs all options that
          apply to your hardware platform. On systems with a
          previous DECwindows Motif installation, the installation
          procedure installs all options selected during the previous
          installation.

          Do you want the defaults for all options? [YES]

          The remainder of this chapter assumes that you answer No to
          this question.

    2.3.2.5 Asking About Selecting a Desktop (Alpha Only)

          On OpenVMS Alpha systems, the installation procedure
          displays information about the New Desktop and asks you
          whether the New Desktop should be the default desktop.

        Install New Desktop

        The New Desktop is a graphical user interface that is derived from the
        Common Desktop Environment (CDE).  It offers the following features not
        available with the traditional DECwindows desktop:

            o Multiple workspaces for greater flexibility in managing windows on
              the screen.

        2.3.2.7 Translated Image Support

              The dialog now prompts you to install Translated Image
              Support (TIS), which enables VAX programs to work in
              the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha environment. Note
              that TIS support is only available for the traditional
              DECwindows desktop environment.

              Translated Image Support

              Translated image support allows programs translated from the VAX
              enviroment to work in the Alpha environment with the DECwindows
              libraries. Translated image support is not available for the New Desktop.

              Translated Image Support [YES]

        2.3.2.8 Language Variants Notice

              The dialog now displays a warning about the need to update
              any language variants. You should not install DECwindows
              Motif Version 1.2-6 unless you will also install DECwindows
              Motif Version 1.2-6 language variants for all the languages
              that you wish to use.

              If a Local Language Variant is installed, refer to the Installation Guide.

              If you have a language variant of DECwindows Motif installed then you
              must upgrade to the version for DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-6 after
              completing this installation and before rebooting the system. A failure
              to do so could prevent DECwindows from starting.

              If there is no local language variant upgrade available for DECwindows Motif
              Version 1.2-6 then you should remove the local language variant before
              installing DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-6.

        2.3.2.11 Verifying DECwindows Motif Support Files

              The installation procedure verifies that DECwindows Motif
              applications and run-time support files are installed on
              the operating system (for example, transport and font
              files, which are required for running DECwindows Motif
              software).

              **** DECwindows Motif application and run-time support files DETECTED ****

              On OpenVMS VAX systems, if the files are not installed, the
              following message is displayed:

              The DECwindows Motif application and run-time support files have not been
              installed.

              You can use the DECwindows tailoring facility to tailor on the device
              support files and the 75DPI and/or the 100DPI font files using the
              DECwindows save sets which are shipped with the OpenVMS kit as follows:

                 $ RUN SYS$UPDATE:DECW$TAILOR

              The installation of DECwindows Motif cannot continue.

              On OpenVMS Alpha systems, the files are always installed.

              Next, the installation procedure checks for the presence
              of support files that are needed to use the system as a
              workstation or as a workstation boot server. If the support
              files are installed, the following message is displayed:

              **** DECwindows device support files DETECTED ****

              On OpenVMS VAX systems, if the files are not installed,
              users are warned with the following message that their
              systems cannot be a workstation or a workstation boot
              server:

                                                                     2-15

    2.3 Installing the Software


          The DECwindows device support files for using this machine as a workstation
          or as a boot node for workstations have not been installed.

          You can use the DECwindows tailoring facility to tailor on the device
          support files and the 75DPI and/or the 100DPI font files using the
          DECwindows save sets, which are shipped with the OpenVMS kit, as follows:

            $ RUN SYS$UPDATE:DECW$TAILOR

          On OpenVMS Alpha systems, if the files are not installed,
          users are warned with the following message that their
          systems cannot be a workstation or a workstation boot
          server:

        The DECwindows device support files for using this machine as a workstation
        or as a boot node for workstations have not been installed.

        You can use the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility to change the
        options selected when the OpenVMS Alpha software was installed.
        See the POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility User's Guide for more
        information. To add the support files and the 75DPI and/or the 100DPI font
        files using the DECwindows save sets which are shipped with the OpenVMS
        kit, use the PRODUCT RECONFIGURE command as follows:

          $ PRODUCT RECONFIGURE VMS

        You should add the "Support for DECwindows" subclass in the Utilities
        class.

          On both systems, the installation procedure then asks the
          following question:

    Do you wish to continue with this installation without the workstation support?

          If you answer No (default) and press the Return key, the
          installation is stopped. See Section 5.3 for information
          on adding the necessary support files. Once you install
          the necessary support files, restart the installation
          procedure.

          If you answer Yes and press the Return key, the
          installation continues.

          Note that this portion of the installation does not occur
          if you are simultaneously installing or upgrading the
          OpenVMS operating system with DECwindows.

                  DEC AXPVMS DWMOTIF V1.2-5              Layered Product

              DEC AXPVMS DWMOTIF V1.2-6: DECwindows Motif

                  System reboot will be required following upgrade of language variants.

                  A system reboot will be required to install the new DECwindow Motif
                  images. If this is a new installation you should execute AUTOGEN
                  using the following command:

                          $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT CHECK_FEEDBACK

                  This command adjusts your system parameters and reboots the system.

                  If you wish to use DECwindows with any language other than English,
                  install the appropriate DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-6 language
                  variant product before using AUTOGEN or rebooting the system.

                  Installation Verification Procedure can be run after reboot.

                  Run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) after the installation
                  is completed and the system is rebooted. The IVP is located in the
                  following directory: SYS$TEST:DECW$IVP.COM.

        2.4 Recovering from Errors

              An error during installation can occur if one or more of
              the following conditions exists:

              o  The operating system version is incorrect.

              o  The prerequisite software version is incorrect.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 inadequate.

              o  Process quotas required by the installation utility are
                 inadequate.

                                                                     2-17

    2.4 Recovering from Errors


          o  The OpenVMS Help library is currently in use.

          For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
          conditions, see the documents listed in the Associated
          Documents section in the Preface. These documents may help
          you diagnose errors and decide what corrective actions to
          take.

          If the installation procedure fails for any reason, the
          POLYCENTER Software Installation utility displays a message
          similar to the following:

          %PCSIUI-INSFAIL, The installation of DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-6 for
          OpenVMS has failed.

          If the installation fails, fix the problem and restart the
          installation procedure.

    2.5 Adjusting Parameters After Installation

          If you are simultaneously installing or upgrading the
          OpenVMS operating system with DECwindows from the CD-
          ROM, the installation procedure will will check the system
          parameters at this point.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             You will not see this message if this is a new
             installation of DECwindows.

             ______________________________________________________

          When Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS attempts to start
          after successful installation, you will see a message
          similar to the following:

    %DECW-W-BADVALUE, SYSGEN parameter GBLPAGES is 120000, should be at least 150000
    %DECW-W-BADVALUE, Free GBLPAGES is 75040 should be at least 92000
    %DECW-W_BADVALUE, SYSGEN parameter CLISYMTBL is 256, should be at least 512
    Some SYSGEN parameters must be reset for DECwindows to start. If you type
    YES, AUTOGEN will change these parameters and reboot your system. If you type
    NO, AUTOGEN will not be run or cause a reboot but DECwindows will not start.
    Do you want the system to run AUTOGEN for you [YES]

          At this point, press RETURN. The system will run AUTOGEN,
          adjust your system parameters, reboot the system and
          display the DECwindows login.

             Before beginning the installation procedure,
             review Chapter 1 for information about installation
             preparations and requirements.

             ______________________________________________________

          This chapter presents information about the following
          topics:

          o  Section 3.1, Installation Procedure Requirements

          o  Section 3.2, Installation Procedure

          o  Section 3.3, Recovering from Errors

          o  Section 3.4, Accessing the Release Notes

    3.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

          This section discusses the requirements for installing your
          Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX software using the
          VMSINSTAL installation procedure.

          Refer to Section 1.8 for information on requirements common
          to both VMSINSTAL and PCSI installations.

          Prepare to install Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
          software by logging in to a privileged account, such as
          the system manager (SYSTEM) account. See Section 3.1.1 for
          the prerequisite privileges. Although Compaq prefers that
          you perform the installation using the operator console or
          other hardcopy terminal, you can perform the installation
          from a DECterm window.

                   Using the VMSINSTAL Procedure (VMS Version 5.5-2 Only)
                                  3.1 Installation Procedure Requirements


        3.1.1 Process Privileges

              To install Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software,
              you must be logged in to an account that has the SETPRV
              privilege or the following privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

              The installation procedures turn off the BYPASS privilege
              at the start of the installation and turn it back on when
              the installation is completed.

        3.1.2 Using an Alternate Working Device

              You can use the alternate working device (AWD) option
              to specify another disk to temporarily store the files
              while they are being unpacked from the save sets on the
              distribution media. Once the save sets are unpacked, the
              installation procedure adds or replaces the files that are
              necessary for the installation of Compaq DECwindows Motif
              for OpenVMS software from the AWD to the system disk.

              If this installation is to upgrade an existing DECwindows
              Motif environment, then the AWD option allows you to
              perform an installation with fewer free blocks on the
              system disk than are otherwise required.

              The installation procedure creates a temporary working
              directory either on the AWD device or by default in the
              following location:

              SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSUPD.facunvvv]

              If you use the AWD option, you can specify a directory.
              Specifying a directory is optional, but the following
              guidelines apply:

              o  If you specify an existing directory, the installation
                 procedure creates a working directory as a subdirectory
                 within the directory that you specify (for example,
                 [WORK.facunvvv]). The installation procedure deletes
                 the working subdirectory after the installation is
                 completed.

                                                                      3-3

 



    Using the VMSINSTAL Procedure (VMS Version 5.5-2 Only)
    3.1 Installation Procedure Requirements


          o  If you do not specify a directory, the installation
             procedure creates a working directory on the
             specified device with a directory specification of
             [000000.facunvvv]. The installation procedure deletes
             the working directory after the installation is
             completed.

          o  If you specify a nonexistent directory, the installation
             procedure creates both the specified directory and a
             working directory as subdirectories within the directory
             that you specify. The installation procedure deletes
             only the working directory and not the originally
             specified directory after the installation is completed.
             You must delete the specified directory manually.

          Use the following format to invoke the VMSINSTAL procedure
          and specify the AWD option:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL facunvvv dkcu OPTIONS N,AWD=ddcu:[dir]

          Use the following definitions for the variables in the
          command line:

          o  For facunvvv, supply the product name and version
             number.

             For the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
             installation, the value of facunvvv is DWMOTIFVAXU6012.

          o  For dkcu, give the device name of the source drive that
             holds the distribution media.

          o  For ddcu, give the device name of the alternate working
             device.

          o  For dir, specify the name of the directory on the
             alternate working device where the product subdirectory
             will be created. The default is [000000].

          For example, to install the Compaq DECwindows Motif for
          OpenVMS product from the compact disc onto an OpenVMS VAX
          system using DKA2 as the alternate working device, enter
          the following command:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DWMOTIFVAXU6012 source-drive -
          _$ OPTIONS N,AWD=DKA2:

        3.1.3 Using the Distributed File Service

              You can specify a temporary working directory on a disk
              that uses the Distributed File Service (DFS).

              If you use a DFS-mounted disk as your alternate working
              device, the installation procedure erroneously reports that
              there are -1 free blocks on the alternate working device.
              This error occurs because the DFS client (the installation
              procedure, in this case) cannot determine the amount of
              free disk space on the DFS-mounted disk.

              Before using a DFS-mounted disk, manually determine its
              free disk space. Log in to the system on which the disk is
              mounted, and enter the SHOW DEVICE command as follows:

              $ SHOW DEVICE

        3.2 Installation Procedure

              The Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS installation
              procedure consists of a series of questions and
              informational messages. Enter a question mark (?) for help
              at any time during the installation. See Appendix B for
              a sample VMSINSTAL installation of DECwindows Motif on an
              OpenVMS VAX system.

              To stop the installation procedure, press Ctrl/Y. When
              you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure deletes all
              files created up to that point and then exits. You can then
              restart the installation.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                This option is not recommended.

                ______________________________________________________

        3.2.1 Product and Device Names

              During the installation, you must tell the system what
              product is being installed and which drive contains the
              distribution media. Refer to a product with its facility
              name and version; refer to a drive with its device name.
              Use the following format to enter product and device names:

              o  facunvvv

                                                                      3-5

          your VAX processor.

    3.2.2 Invoking the VMSINSTAL Procedure

          To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command
          procedure from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM
          account. The VMSINSTAL.COM file is located in the
          SYS$UPDATE directory.

          When the system prompts you with a question during the
          installation procedure, the default answer is often listed
          in brackets ([]).

          Perform the following steps to run the VMSINSTAL procedure
          and install Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software:

          1. Locate the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
             distribution media.

          2. If your system is not already running, start up the
             system and log in to a privileged account, such as the
             system manager (SYSTEM) account.

                                               3.2 Installation Procedure


              3. Place the distribution media in the source drive. If
                 your Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS distribution
                 kit contains more than one volume, place the first
                 volume in the drive. During the installation procedure,
                 you will be prompted to load the next volume. The paper
                 labels on the media indicate the order in which you load
                 them.

              4. Start the VMSINSTAL procedure. On the command line,
                 specify the product name (that is, the facility name):
                 DWMOTIFVAXU6012 for OpenVMS VAX systems.

                 Specify OPTIONS N to access the release notes, which are
                 included in your media kit. The Compaq DECwindows Motif
                 for OpenVMS Release Notes can be displayed or printed
                 before the installation begins. Enter the following
                 command at the DCL prompt:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DWMOTIFVAXU6012 ddcu: OPTIONS N

                 For ddcu, specify the device name of the source drive
                 that holds the distribution media. See Section 3.2.1 for
                 more information about the format of product and device
                 names. Also, see the OpenVMS upgrade and installation
                 supplement for your VAX processor.

                 For example, if you install Compaq DECwindows Motif for
                 OpenVMS from a magnetic tape cartridge in drive MUA0:,
                 enter the following command to invoke the VMSINSTAL
                 command procedure:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DWMOTIFVAXU6012 MUA0: OPTIONS N

                 If you install Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS using
                 the alternate working device (AWD) option described in
                 Section 3.1.2, invoke the VMSINSTAL command procedure as
                 follows:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DWMOTIFVAXU6012 ddcu: OPTIONS N,AWD=ddcu:[dir]

                 The first instance of ddcu is the device name of the
                 source drive that holds the distribution media. The
                 second instance of ddcu is the device name of the AWD,
                 which is the target device. The variable dir is the
                 name of the directory on the alternate working device in
                 which the product subdirectory is created. The default
                 directory is [000000].

                                                                      3-7

        3.2.7 Preserving the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 Programming
              Environment

              If DECwindows Motif is already installed on your system,
              the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 programming environment is
              incompatible with Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
              software. (Note that the OSF/Motif Release 1.2 programming
              environment is overwritten with the OSF/Motif Release 1.2.3
              Toolkit when you install the Compaq DECwindows Motif for
              OpenVMS software.)

              The installation procedure asks whether you want to
              preserve the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 programming
              environment:

                  The DECwindows Motif programming environment was installed with a
                  previous version of this kit.  This environment is incompatible with the
                  OSF/Motif Release 1.2 environment provided with DECwindows Motif Version
                  1.2-6. The XUI programming environment is also not included in
                  DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-6.

                  If you intend to continue developing programs for XUI or OSF/Motif
                  Release 1.1.3 you should save this environment.  Please refer to the
                  installation guide for more details and information on accessing these
                  files in their new location.

                  If you do not choose to save the XUI and OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3
                  programming environment, those files will be removed from the system
                  disk.

                * Do you want to save the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 and XUI
                * programming support files [No]?

                                                                     3-11

 



    Using the VMSINSTAL Procedure (VMS Version 5.5-2 Only)
    3.2 Installation Procedure


          If you want to preserve the XUI and OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3
          programming environment, enter Yes and press the Return
          key. The installation procedure creates subdirectories that
          contain the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 programming files so
          that they can be used for programming at a later time.

          See Section 1.6 for information about how to reference the
          previous version of the programming support files.

    3.2.8 Installing the Entire Kit

          You can install the entire Compaq DECwindows Motif for
          OpenVMS software kit, or you can install part of the kit.
          The DECwindows Motif base kit is always installed; the
          Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS programming environment
          is optional.

          The procedure asks you whether you want to install the
          entire kit:

              You can install the DECwindows Motif kit completely or in selected
              portions.  A complete installation requires as many as 82,500 blocks.
              If you choose to perform a partial installation, you can select
              (tailor) the programming support files that support your DECwindows
              Motif application development.  Whether you perform a complete or partial
              installation, this kit provides support for running DECwindows Motif
              applications on OpenVMS compute servers.

    3.2.9 Choosing Programming Support Files

          The installation procedure asks whether you want to install
          programming support:

              This installation procedure provides support files for developing
              DECwindows Motif applications in several programming languages.  These
              files are needed only to develop applications and are not required to run
              DECwindows Motif applications.  The free disk space requirement for each
              programming support file ranges from 3000 to 8000 blocks.

          enter Yes and press the Return key.

    3.2.11 Verifying Disk Space

          The installation procedure checks whether your system disk
          contains a sufficient number of free blocks.

          1. If the blocks are available, the installation continues
             (see Section 3.2.12).

          2. If you do not have sufficient system disk space to
             install the portions you chose, the installation
             displays a message similar to the following:

             Your system disk has only 25364 free blocks, and
             you have selected to install approximately 76050 blocks.

                                       * * * N O T E * * *

             The installation procedure has determined that you do not have enough
             disk space to complete the installation.  However, it may be possible
             to continue successfully if you are installing DECwindows Motif on a
             system that already has DECwindows Motif installed.

           * Do you want to reselect which DECwindows Motif options to install [Yes]?

             If you press the Return key, you can reselect the
             DECwindows Motif options beginning with those described
             in Section 3.2.8. If you enter No, the procedure asks
             whether you want to continue the installation:

             * Do you want to continue the installation anyway [Yes]?

             _______________________ Caution _______________________

             If you press the Return key, the installation
             continues. However, if you exceed the amount of
             available disk space, the installation fails.

                                               3.2 Installation Procedure


                 If you enter No, the installation ends. You can then
                 either free up blocks on the system disk and restart
                 the installation or start the installation again using
                 the AWD option. (See Section 3.1.2 for information about
                 using the AWD option.)

              3. If you specify an alternate working device that does not
                 have sufficient disk space to install the portions you
                 have chosen, the installation displays a message similar
                 to the following:

                Your specified alternate working directory device has only 68977
                free blocks, and this installation will require approximately 76050 blocks.

                You should either reselect which DECwindows Motif options to install, or
                restart this installation using an alternate working directory device with
                more free blocks.

                                *  *  *  NOTE  *  *  *

                Although the installation procedure estimates you do not have enough disk
                space to complete the installation, it may be possible to continue
                successfully if you are installing DECwindows Motif on a system which
                already has DECwindows installed.

              * Do you want to reselect which DECwindows Motif options to install [Yes]?

                 If you press the Return key, you can reselect the
                 DECwindows Motif options beginning with those described
                 in Section 3.2.8. If you enter No, the procedure asks
                 whether you want to continue the installation:

                 * Do you want to continue the installation anyway [Yes]?

                 If you press the Return key, the installation continues.

                _______________________ Caution _______________________

                If you lack sufficient free disk space for
                installation on the alternate working device, the
                installation procedure ends.

                ______________________________________________________

                 If you enter No, the installation procedure ends.
                 Restart the installation once you set up an alternate
                 working device with sufficient disk space. (See
                 Section 3.1.2 for more information about using the AWD
                 option.)

                                                                     3-15

    3.2 Installation Procedure


    3.2.12 Verifying License Registration

          The installation procedure continues and displays license
          information similar to the following:

              A registered and loaded product authorization key for DW-MOTIF is
              required to run any DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS application. If you
              answer No to the next question, the installation of DECwindows Motif for
              OpenVMS will be terminated.

                    Product:      DW-MOTIF
                    Producer:     DEC
                    Version:
                    Release Date:

            * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded ?

          Note that the NET-APP-SUP-250 and NET-APP-SUP-300 PAKs are
          also valid. Enter Yes to continue with the installation
          if your authorization key is registered and loaded. If
          you enter No, the following message is displayed and the
          installation ends:

          Installation of DECwindows Motif cannot continue because you do
          not have a registered and loaded authorization key.

          See Section 1.1 for more information about license
          registration. After you register and load your
          authorization key, restart the Compaq DECwindows Motif for
          OpenVMS installation beginning at step 4 in Section 3.2.2.

    3.2.13 Performing a System Reboot

          The installation procedure suggests that you perform a
          system reboot to ensure successful installation of Compaq
          DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software:

              DECwindows Motif will not start if your system parameters are not
              correct.

              o If you allow a system shutdown, the installation procedure will
                reboot the system at the end of the installation.  If your system
                parameters are incorrect, the installation will run AUTOGEN prior
                to the system reboot.

              o If you do not allow a system shutdown, the installation procedure
                will continue, and you will be informed at the end of the
                installation whether you need to modify your system parameters in
                order to start DECwindows Motif.

                  To complete the installation of this product, you should reboot
                  the system.  If it is not convenient to reboot at this time, then
                  enter No to the following question.

                  If you enter No, the installation procedure will continue.

                * Will you allow a system reboot after this product is installed [Yes]?

              If you entered No to the shutdown question, no further
              questions are asked.

              If you answered Yes to the shutdown question, the VMSINSTAL
              procedure displays the following questions about the
              shutdown:

              * How many minutes for system shutdown [0]?
              * Do you want to do an automatic system reboot [Yes]?

                No further questions will be asked.

                _______________________ Caution _______________________

                To avoid confusion with file versions when activating
                an image or application, perform the necessary
                procedures to restart the Compaq DECwindows Motif for
                OpenVMS software as indicated during the installation

              The installation procedure then reminds you to install
              the language variant product after the installation, if
              necessary.

              If you wish to use any language other than English, install the appropriate
              DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-6 language variant product after
              this installation has completed.

              You are notified that you should run the Installation
              Verification Procedure (IVP) after the installation
              is completed and after you start the DECwindows Motif
              software. (See Section 4.2 for more information about
              running the IVP.)

              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) should be run after the

             workstation system and your system parameters need to be
             reset, the following message is displayed:

             The installation of DECwindows Motif has determined that some of your
             system parameter values will require modification in order to start
             Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS, Version 1.2--6.  To set your
             parameters correctly, run AUTOGEN using the following DCL command:

                     $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT CHECK_FEEDBACK

             This will adjust your system parameters and reboot the system.

          o  A workstation system that runs Compaq DECwindows Motif
             for OpenVMS with incorrect system parameters, and you
             answered Yes to a system shutdown

             The OpenVMS AUTOGEN procedure will now be run to set your system
             parameters. After that, your system will be automatically rebooted.

             After the system has been rebooted, successful installation of the
             workstation software will be indicated by the appearance of the
             Start Session window.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             If you upgrade your system with a higher version of
             OpenVMS at a later time, you might need to reinstall
             the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software.

             ______________________________________________________

    3.3 Recovering from Errors

          Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
          following conditions exist:

          o  Incorrect OpenVMS operating system version.

          o  Insufficient quotas.

          o  Insufficient values for system parameters.

          o  OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

          o  Product license is not registered and loaded.

          For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
          conditions, see the documents listed in the Associated
          Documents section in the Preface. These documents may help
          you diagnose errors and decide what corrective actions to
          take.

    3.4 Accessing the Release Notes

          During the installation, the VMSINSTAL procedure copies the
          Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Release Notes to the
          SYS$HELP:DECW$MOTIFU6012.RELEASE_NOTES file. Once you
          return to DCL level, you can print this file or display it
          at a terminal. Refer to Section 3.2.5 for more information
          about accessing the release notes.

                                            After Installing the Software


              This chapter discusses the tasks that you need to perform
              after the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS installation
              is completed:

              o  Section 4.1, Starting the DECwindows Motif Software

              o  Section 4.2, Running the IVP

              o  Section 4.3, Choosing an Alternate Console

              o  Section 4.4, Selecting the Desktop (Alpha Only)

              If the DW-MOTIF license that is installed on your system
              is not valid, appropriate messages display on your console
              terminal and DECwindows Motif is not automatically started.
              If this situation occurs, log in to the system, install the
              valid license, and start your DECwindows Motif software.
              For complete information on installing licenses using LMF,
              see the OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

        4.1 Starting the DECwindows Motif Software

              If you perform a system reboot following the installation
              of DECwindows Motif, the DECwindows startup procedure runs
              automatically when the system reboots. On OpenVMS Alpha
              systems, either the New Desktop login dialog box or the
              DECwindows desktop Start Session dialog box is displayed,
              depending on the value of the DECW$START_NEW_DESKTOP global
              symbol. (See Section 4.4 for more information.) On OpenVMS
              VAX systems the Start Session dialog box is displayed.
              Proceed to Section 4.2 if you allowed a system reboot and
              DECwindows has successfully started.

              If you chose not to reboot the system after the
              installation, you must start or restart the DECwindows
              Motif software by running the DECwindows startup procedure,
              as described in the following paragraphs. When the startup

                                                                      4-1

 



    After Installing the Software
    4.1 Starting the DECwindows Motif Software


          procedure has successfully completed, either the New
          Desktop login dialog box or the DECwindows desktop Start
          Session dialog box is displayed, as explained in the
          previous paragraph.

          Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software can be started
          only if your system parameters are correct. Proceed to one
          of the following sections if your system parameters are
          correct:

          o  Section 4.1.1, Standalone Systems

          o  Section 4.1.2, OpenVMS Cluster Systems

          If your system parameters are not correct, then use one of
          the following methods to adjust them accordingly:

          o  Invoke the AUTOGEN utility:

             $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT CHECK_FEEDBACK

          o  Attempt to start the DECwindows Motif software. The
             DECwindows Motif startup procedure checks your system
             parameters. If they are too low, the procedure displays
             a series of messages describing the required system
             parameters. These same parameters are adjusted in the
             system's MODPARAMS.DAT file. Then the procedure displays
             following:

    Some SYSGEN parameters must be reset for DECwindows to start.
    If you type YES, AUTOGEN will change these parameters and reboot your system.
    If you type NO, AUTOGEN will not run or cause a reboot, but DECwindows
    will not start.

    To run AUTOGEN at a later date, enter the following command:

      $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN getdata reboot check_feedback

    Do you want the system to run AUTOGEN for you [Yes]?

          After the system is rebooted and the startup is completed,
          the Start Session dialog box displays.

          The Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software is now
          installed and running on your system.

          Run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) as
          described in Section 4.2 to verify that the installation
          of Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software is complete
          and accurate.

        4.1.1 Standalone Systems

              Perform one of the following procedures to start your
              DECwindows Motif software on a standalone system:

              o  If your system is not running DECwindows Motif, then
                 start DECwindows Motif with the following command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP

              o  If your system is currently running DECwindows Motif,
                 then restart DECwindows Motif with the following
                 command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP RESTART

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If your system has a workstation display, then the
                command to restart DECwindows Motif will end your
                current session. The Start Session dialog box displays
                on your terminal, and you must log back in to continue
                using DECwindows Motif.

                ______________________________________________________

              The Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software is now
              installed and running on your system.

              Run the IVP as described in Section 4.2 to verify that
              the installation of Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS is
              complete and accurate.

        4.1.2 OpenVMS Cluster Systems

              Starting Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS on
              nonsatellite and satellite nodes is described in the
              sections that follow.

        4.1.2.1 Starting Nonsatellite and Boot Nodes

              To start Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software on
              each of the nonsatellite nodes within your cluster, perform
              one of the following procedures:

              o  If your system is not running DECwindows Motif, then
                 start DECwindows Motif with the following command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP

                                                                      4-3

 



    After Installing the Software
    4.1 Starting the DECwindows Motif Software


          o  If your system is currently running DECwindows Motif,
             then restart DECwindows Motif with the following
             command:

             $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP RESTART

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             If the nonsatellite node or boot node has a
             workstation display, then the command to restart
             DECwindows Motif will end your current session. The
             Start Session dialog box displays on your terminal;
             log in again to continue using DECwindows Motif.

             ______________________________________________________

          The Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software is now
          installed and running on your system.

          Run the IVP as described in Section 4.2 to verify that the
          installation of the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
          product is complete and accurate.

    4.1.2.2 Starting Satellite Nodes

          To start the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software
          that is installed on the boot node, perform one of the
          following procedures on each satellite node in the cluster
          that will run Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software:

          o  If the node is not running DECwindows Motif, then start
             DECwindows Motif with the following command:

             $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP

          o  If the node is currently running DECwindows Motif, then
             restart DECwindows Motif with the following command:

             $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP RESTART

          Once DECwindows Motif is started or restarted on each node
          in the OpenVMS Cluster, then the installation is considered
          complete. Now run the IVP as described in Section 4.2.

                                                      4.2 Running the IVP


        4.2 Running the IVP

              Run the IVP, SYS$TEST:DECW$IVP.COM, after you install and
              start the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS product.
              This procedure contains four tests, which verify that the
              software installation is complete and accurate.

              First, the IVP procedure attempts to run two display-
              oriented tests. When you invoke the IVP, it identifies
              your type of hardware.

              o  If you are using a workstation, you are asked where
                 the display-oriented tests should display. Your current
                 workstation is the default.

              o  If you are not using a workstation, the procedure
                 prompts you for a display name.

              Press Ctrl/Z at the prompt if you do not want to run the
              display-oriented tests. The IVP runs these tests only if
              the images exist on the system. If the IVP does not find
              the images, a message displays to inform you that the tests
              will not be run.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you are invoking the IVP from a LAT Xterminal using
                LAT software, enter the following command first:

                $ SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=LAT_nnnnnnnnnnnn/TRANSPORT=LAT

                Substitute your actual LAT terminal number for
                nnnnnnnnnn.

                Enter the default at the _Display: prompt.

                ______________________________________________________

              Next, the IVP runs two nondisplay-oriented tests.

              o  The first of these tests invokes the Motif UIL compiler.
                 If you did not install programming support, the IVP
                 informs you that this test will not be run because the
                 Motif UIL image does not exist. If this test is run, you
                 are notified of its completion status.

                                                                      4-5

 



    After Installing the Software
    4.2 Running the IVP


          o  The last test converts a text file to DDIF format and
             then converts it back to text, comparing the original
             text file with the result. If the files match, the
             test is successful. You are notified of its completion
             status.

          Example 4-1 shows you how to run the IVP.

                                        4.3 Choosing an Alternate Console


        4.3 Choosing an Alternate Console

              The Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS software allows
              you to boot all configurations from the main console. You
              can then toggle between displaying and not displaying the
              operator window by pressing Ctrl/F2. The main console is
              always a workstation screen.

              If you are logged in to the main console (workstation
              screen), you must log out before DECwindows will start.
              Issue the following command from the main console:

               $  @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP

              Once the command procedure completes, log out of the main
              console. Otherwise the server will not start and a login
              box will not appear.

              For an alternative console, you can use a terminal
              connected to the workstation by means of a terminal port.

              If you boot from the main console, the alternative console
              is connected when you invoke the DECwindows Motif startup
              command procedure.

              If you boot the system from an alternative console,
              you cannot start the Console Window application. This
              application is described in the release notes.

        4.4 Selecting the Desktop (Alpha Only)

              On OpenVMS Alpha systems, Compaq DECwindows Motif for
              OpenVMS provides a choice of two desktops: the New Desktop,
              which is derived from the Common Desktop Environment (CDE),
              and the traditional DECwindows desktop.

              During the installation, if you choose to install both the
              New Desktop and the DECwindows desktop, you are asked which
              desktop you wish to be the default desktop.

              To select the other desktop as the default desktop, perform
              the following steps.

              1. If the file SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.COM does
                 not exist, copy it from DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.TEMPLATE
                 (or create it if an earlier version of DECwindows Motif
                 has not been installed on your system). For example:

                                                                      4-7

              This chapter contains information about managing the
              performance of your Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
              software. It also describes how to add and remove
              DECwindows Motif files from your system disk using
              tailoring utilities. See Managing DECwindows Motif
              for OpenVMS Systems for additional system management
              information.

              The following topics are discussed in this chapter:

              o  Section 5.1, Customizing the DECwindows X11 Display
                 Server Startup Procedure

              o  Section 5.2, Using the DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR Utility (VMS
                 Version 5.5-2 Only)

              o  Section 5.3, Adding DECwindows Base-Support Files

              o  Section 5.4, Determining and Reporting Problems

              After you install the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
              product, you can tune your system to enhance performance
              or to decrease the use of some system resources. For
              information about tuning your system, see Managing
              DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Systems.

        5.1 Customizing the DECwindows X11 Display Server Startup
            Procedure

              The DECwindows X11 display server manages the graphics
              devices on your workstation, such as the display, keyboard,
              and mouse.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Start the DECwindows X11 display server on workstation
                systems only.

                ______________________________________________________

                                                                      5-1

 



    Managing DECwindows Motif Software
    5.1 Customizing the DECwindows X11 Display Server Startup Procedure


          The startup command procedures automatically determine
          most of the configuration parameters for the DECwindows
          X11 display server. However, the command procedures cannot
          determine some items, such as the following:

          o  Whether you have a 75-dpi or 100-dpi monitor

          o  Whether you have a North American keyboard layout
             (such as for an LK201-AA or -LA or an LK401-AA or -LA
             keyboard)

          o  Whether the DECwindows X11 display server uses only
             DECnet for OpenVMS software and local transports

          o  Whether the DECwindows X11 display server logs both
             successful and unsuccessful connect and disconnect
             messages to the DECW$SERVER_n_ERROR.LOG file

          To ensure that the DECwindows X11 display server is set up
          correctly, modify the server startup file as follows:

          1. Make a copy of the file SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_
             SERVER_SETUP.TEMPLATE and rename it to
             SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM. This
             server startup file shows how to customize individual
             workstations by adding a section of DCL commands for
             each workstation.

             You can add setup options in either of two sections
             in the server startup file. Setup options added to the
             "Cluster Common or Standalone Workstation Setup" section
             affect all nodes in a cluster. Setup options added to
             the "Cluster Member Workstation-Specific Setup" section
             affect only individual nodes. If you add a workstation-
             specific option, you must also update the variable node_
             list.

          2. If your screen supports 100 dots-per-inch, add the
             following line:

             $ DECW$SERVER_DENSITY == "100"

             Add this line to the section for each workstation that
             has a 100 dots-per-inch monitor, or add it to the common
             section for all workstations (if all the workstations
             have 100-dpi monitors).

      5.1 Customizing the DECwindows X11 Display Server Startup Procedure


              3. If you want the server to log successful connect and
                 disconnect messages, add the following line:

                 $ DECW$SERVER_CONNECT_LOG == "TRUE"

              4. Add the following line to the section for monochrome GPX
                 workstations:

                 $ DECW$COLOR == "FALSE"

                 No modification is necessary for grayscale (intensity)
                 screens.

              5. Add the following line to the section for workstations
                 with keyboards that are not North American LK201 models:

                 $ DECW$DEFAULT_KEYMAP == "xxxxx"

                 In the previous line, replace xxxxx with the correct
                 DECwindows keymap name. You can determine the correct
                 name from the model number of your LK201 or LK401
                 keyboard. Turn the keyboard upside down and look for a
                 label that specifies the model number. The model number
                 is in a format similar to LK201-xx or LK401-xx. The
                 model number may also be listed as LK201 or LK401. In
                 this case, the xx that you need is in another part of
                 the label where there is a number that looks similar to
                 the following:

                 nn-nnnnn-xx

                 Use the xx part of this number to choose a keymap name
                 from Table 5-1. Choose the keymap ending in _DP for
                 data-processing keyboard layout and the keymap ending in
                 _TW for typewriter layout.

                 Table 5-1 is arranged according to the dialect for which
                 each keyboard is designed.

                 After you choose a keymap name, modify the DECwindows
                 X11 display server startup file. For example, to change
                 the keyboard layout to a Dutch typewriter layout, add
                 the following line to the DECwindows X11 display server
                 startup file:

                 $ DECW$DEFAULT_KEYBOARD_MAP == "DUTCH_LK201LH_TW"

                                                                      5-3

 



    Managing DECwindows Motif Software
    5.1 Customizing the DECwindows X11 Display Server Startup Procedure


             Add a similar line for each workstation that does not
             have a North American keyboard layout or add the line
             to the common section for all workstations (if all the
             workstations use the same keyboard layout).

          6. Enter the following command to restart DECwindows Motif
             on the workstations for which you customized the server
             startup by using the following command:

             $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP RESTART

    5.2 Using the DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR Utility (VMS Version 5.5-2 Only)

          Use the DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR utility to remove DECwindows
          Motif files from the system disk (for example, support
          files for the Toolkit, applications, and programming). If
          you later decide that you want DECwindows Motif programming
          support, add the files to the system disk by reinstalling
          the system. See Section 5.3 for information about adding
          files.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Use the DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR utility only if you
             installed the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS kit using
             VMSINSTAL. If you installed the Compaq DECwindows
             Motif for OpenVMS kit using the POLYCENTER Software
             Installation utility (PCSI), remove files using the
             PCSI commands PRODUCT REMOVE or PRODUCT RECONFIGURE.
             (For more information on PCSI commands, enter HELP
             PRODUCT at the DCL prompt or refer to the POLYCENTER
             Software Installation Utility User's Guide.)

         5.2 Using the DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR Utility (VMS Version 5.5-2 Only)


              The DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR process includes two phases:

              o  The first phase lists each class of DECwindows Motif
                 files and asks whether you want to delete the class from
                 the system disk.

              o  The second phase deletes the files you indicated from
                 the system disk.

              Table 5-2 lists the classes (or groups) and subclasses
              of DECwindows Motif files that you can delete using the
              DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR utility. For a list of DECwindows Motif
              files and their descriptions and classes, see Appendix C.

              Removing DECwindows Motif Files from the System Disk

              To remove DECwindows Motif files from the system disk, do
              the following:

              1. Log in to the SYSTEM account.

              2. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

                 $ RUN SYS$UPDATE:DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR

                 After a brief overview, the DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR utility
                 lists each group, or class, of files and its size in
                 blocks. Files are grouped according to their function.
                 For example, all the files required for DECwindows for
                 OpenVMS device support are in one class. A file class is
                 made up of many small subclasses. You can eliminate an
                 entire class of files, or you can eliminate one or more
                 of its subclasses. For example:

                 CLASS - VMS DECwindows Motif applications files
                              Size of entire class (with subclasses): 12181
                              Size of common files required for any subclass: 11160
                              Do you wish to select the entire class (default = NO)?
                              Do you wish to select any of its subclasses (default = NO)?
                           .
                           .

                                                                     5-11

          3. Decide which file classes or subclasses you do not
             need to support your system. The DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR
             utility displays step-by-step instructions. Follow
             these instructions to specify which of the classes or
             subclasses you want to remove.

          4. The DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR utility deletes the files you
             select and displays the names of those files.

          You can ignore "file not found" messages in the log files;
          tailoring functions are not affected by these messages. The
          installation procedure deletes files that it does not read.

             _______________________ Caution _______________________

             To cancel DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR during the first phase,
             press Ctrl/C, Ctrl/Y, or Ctrl/Z. If you cancel
             DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR during the second phase, a partially
             tailored disk may result. For a description of both
             phases, see Section 5.2.

             ______________________________________________________

          Example 5-1 shows how to use DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR to remove
          files from a system disk.

    TAILOR-OFF
    ----------
     You will now be prompted with a list of the classes and subclasses of
     DECwindows files that are optional. The size of each class and subclass is
     included in the list. This will help you decide whether or not you want to
     remove a class or subclass from your system.

     Under some classes there is a set of common files that is required in order
     for any subclasses to work. These files will only be deleted if you remove
     the ENTIRE class. If you choose to keep any subclass, this set of files is
     not deleted.

    5.3 Adding DECwindows Base-Support Files

          If you previously chose not to install or if you removed
          DECwindows base-support software, perform one of the
          following procedures to add DECwindows base-support files:

          o  On OpenVMS Alpha systems, reconfigure the operating
             system specifying that you want DECwindows Motif
             support.

          o  On OpenVMS VAX systems, use the
             SYS$UPDATE:DECW$TAILOR.EXE procedure to add or remove
             support files from the system disk.

                                 5.3 Adding DECwindows Base-Support Files


        5.3.1 Reconfiguring the OpenVMS Operating System (Alpha Only)

              To reconfigure the OpenVMS Alpha operating system to add
              DECwindows Motif support, use the PRODUCT RECONFIGURE
              command.

        5.3.2 Using the SYS$UPDATE:DECW$TAILOR.EXE Command (VAX Only)

              You can use the DECW$TAILOR utility to add or remove some
              or all DECwindows base-support files from the system disk.

              DECW$TAILOR is similar to DECW$MOTIF_TAILOR. However, the
              DECW$TAILOR utility is used to add or remove files that
              support the DECwindows display server (for example: base-
              support, workstation, and font files).

              DECW$TAILOR includes three phases:

              o  The first phase asks whether you want to tailor your
                 system by adding files ("tailor on") or by deleting
                 files ("tailor off").

              o  In the second phase, if you choose the tailor-on
                 procedure, DECW$TAILOR lists each class of DECwindows
                 files and asks whether you want to include them on the
                 system disk. If you choose the tailor-off procedure,
                 DECW$TAILOR lists each class of DECwindows files and
                 asks whether you want to delete them from the system
                 disk.

              o  In the third phase, DECW$TAILOR carries out your
                 instructions.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                To cancel DECW$TAILOR during the first and second
                phases, press Ctrl/C, Ctrl/Y, or Ctrl/Z. If you
                cancel DECW$TAILOR during the third phase, a partially

          Adding DECwindows Files to the System Disk

          To add DECwindows files to the system disk, perform the
          following steps:

          1. Log in to the SYSTEM account.

          2. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt to invoke
             the utility:

             $ RUN SYS$UPDATE:DECW$TAILOR

                                 5.3 Adding DECwindows Base-Support Files


                 After a brief overview, the DECW$TAILOR program lists
                 each group, or class, of files and its size in blocks.
                 Files are grouped according to their function. For
                 example, all the files required for DECwindows device
                 support are in one class. A file class is made up of
                 many small subclasses. You can eliminate an entire
                 class of files, or you can eliminate one or more of
                 its subclasses. For example:

                 CLASS - DECwindows device support files
                           Size of entire class (with subclasses): 14107
                           Size of common files required for any subclass: 10645
                           Do you wish to select the entire class (default = NO)?
                           Do you wish to select any of its subclasses (default = NO)?
                    .
                    .
                    .

              3. Decide which file classes or subclasses are needed to
                 support your system. DECW$TAILOR displays step-by-step
                 instructions. Follow these instructions to specify which
                 of the classes or subclasses you want to add.

                _______________________ Caution _______________________

                To cancel DECW$TAILOR during this phase, press Ctrl/C,
                Ctrl/Y, or Ctrl/Z. If you cancel DECW$TAILOR following
                this class selection phase, a partially tailored disk
                may result.

                ______________________________________________________

              4. DECW$TAILOR creates a temporary command file and
                 asks for the name of the device that contains the
                 distribution media.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The distribution media is the OpenVMS distribution
                media that contains the DECwindows save sets.

                ______________________________________________________

              5. DECW$TAILOR adds the files you selected and displays the
                 names of those files.

                                                                     5-17

          Example 5-2 shows how to use DECW$TAILOR to add files to a
          system disk. The example was run on a VMS 5.5-2 system.

    Example 5-2 Sample DECW$TAILOR Session

    $ RUN SYS$UPDATE:DECW$TAILOR
       .
       .
       .

     Do you want to tailor files "ON" or "OFF"? ON

    TAILOR-ON
    ---------
     You will now be prompted with a list of the classes and subclasses
     of DECwindows files that are optional. The size of each class and subclass is
     included in the list. This will help you decide whether or not you want to add
     a class or subclass to your system.

     Under some classes, there is a set of common files that is required in order
     for any subclasses to work. These files are added when you ask
     for either the entire class or any of its subclasses.

    Total size of the system disk is 1216665 blocks.
    Total space used on the system disk is 1121958 blocks.
    Total space left on the system disk is 94707 blocks.

    CLASS - DECwindows applications files
              Size of entire class (with subclasses): 11544
              No subclasses in this tailor class.
              Do you wish to select the entire class (default = NO)? YES

    CLASS - DECwindows device support files
              Size of entire class (with subclasses): 14107
              Size of common files required for any subclass: 10645

      The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) should be run after the
      installation has been completed and DECwindows Motif has been restarted.
      The IVP can be found in SYS$TEST:DECW$IVP.COM.

      The installation procedure has determined that your system parameters are
      set correctly and that it will not be necessary to run AUTOGEN or reboot
      the system.

      If your system is already running DECwindows Motif, restart DECwindows
      Motif with the following DCL command:

           $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP RESTART

      If your system is NOT already running DECwindows Motif, start DECwindows
      Motif with the following DCL command:

           $ @SYS$MANAGER:DECW$STARTUP

                                * * * N O T E * * *

      If you are installing DECwindows Motif from your workstation console, log
      off after you enter the command to start DECwindows Motif.

      The installation procedure has determined that your system parameter values
      are acceptable.  A reboot of the system is not required.

              If you installed Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS using
              the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility, you can
              obtain a list of all installed files and the directories
              and subdirectories into which the files were installed.

              To obtain this list, enter the following POLYCENTER
              Software Installation utility command:

              $ PRODUCT SHOW OBJECT/product=dwmotif

              Following is a sample output from this command.
