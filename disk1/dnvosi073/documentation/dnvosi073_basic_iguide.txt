                             Preparing to Install DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS


              This chapter describes the tasks you must perform before
              installing and configuring the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
              distribution kit.

        1.1 The POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility

              The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility replaces
              VMSINSTAL as the method of installing layered products for
              OpenVMS systems. It allows you to install several software
              products with a single command.

              Full details for using the POLYCENTER Software Installation
              utility to install and manage software products on your
              system are provided in the OpenVMS System Management
              Utilities Reference Manual. This manual also provides
              information on removing products along with other
              POLYCENTER Software Installation utility features.

              See Appendix A for a basic overview of the POLYCENTER
              Software Installation utility.

        1.2 Inspecting the Distribution Kit

              Before you install the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS software,
              make sure you have a complete software distribution kit. If
              you have the OpenVMS condist CD-ROM distribution kit, check
              the CD master index for the kit location. If you have a
              magtape or TK50 kit, supply the device name when requested
              by the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility.

              Check that the kit contains everything listed on the bill
              of materials (BOM). If anything is missing or damaged,
              contact your Digital representative.

                                      1.2 Inspecting the Distribution Kit


                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Before installing any of the software, read the
                DECnet-Plus Planning Guide (included with your DECnet-
                Plus for OpenVMS core documentation set). This guide
                contains installation planning information, including
                namespace planning instructions.

                ______________________________________________________

        1.3 Time Required for Installation and Configuration

              The time required to complete the DECnet-Plus installation
              and configuration procedures depends on the following:

              o  Configuration option used (FAST, BASIC, or ADVANCED)

              o  Optional software installed

              o  CPU on the system

              o  Type of distribution media

              The time required to install and configure DECnet-Plus
              can vary from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the
              combination of choices you make from the above list.

        1.4 Prerequisite Software and Licenses

              Before you can install and configure the software, the
              system must have the required operating system software and
              license(s).

        1.4.1 Software and Licenses

              The prerequisites for installing DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
              software are as follows:

              o  OpenVMS operating system Version 7.0 or 7.1

              o  One of the available DECnet-Plus licenses

              The specific license required on your system is determined
              by the functions you want to use:

              o  Basic function license (DVNETEND) - provides end system
                 support.

        Preparing to Install DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
        1.4 Prerequisite Software and Licenses


              o  Extended function license (DVNETEXT) for Alpha systems
                 - provides end system support, DECdts server, cluster
                 alias, and OSI applications gateways.

              o  Extended function license (DVNETRTG) for VAX systems
                 - provides end system support, DECdns server, DECdts
                 server, cluster alias, and OSI applications gateways.

                 For the extended function licenses, the TELNET/VT
                 gateway also requires the Digital TCP/IP Services for
                 OpenVMS product.

              o  X.25 license (Alpha systems only) - provides
                 functionality over a wide area network link.

              At least one node of an OpenVMS Cluster system requires the
              extended function license to use cluster alias.

        1.4.1.1 DECnet and OSI Applications over TCP/IP

              If you plan to use the DECnet-Plus over TCP/IP feature,
              then TCP/IP software is a prerequisite. Your end system
              will be able to operate over TCP/IP if and only if the
              TCP/IP product used on your system supports the PATHWORKS
              Internet Protocol (PWIP) interface.

              The PWIP interface is currently supported by the products
              listed below. Contact the vendor for the required versions
              of their product.

                Plus for OpenVMS Network Management guide.

                ______________________________________________________

        1.4.2 Checking Licenses

              To determine the OpenVMS operating system version number,
              enter the following DCL command:

              $ show system <Return>

              To determine whether a DECnet-Plus license is registered,
              enter the following DCL command:

              $ show license dvnet* <Return>

              If the system does not have the required license(s),
              obtain the Product Authorization Key (PAK) and register
              the license. For instructions on registering a license,
              refer to the OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

        1.5 System Requirements

              Before you install the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
              software, make sure that your system meets the following
              requirements.

        1.5.1 Disk Space

              If this is the first time you are installing DECnet-Plus on
              a particular system, ensure that you have enough free space
              on the system disk. You need enough space to install the
              DECnet-Plus Base components and any options you select.

              If you already have DECnet-Plus installed, you need
              considerably less free space for the installation because
              the earlier installation allocated most of the space that a
              subsequent installation needs.

        1.5.3.1 SYSGEN Parameters for OpenVMS Cluster Members

              When installing DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS on an OpenVMS
              Cluster, make sure that all cluster members have the
              suggested SYSGEN parameters set correctly. If a node in
              the cluster does not have the required minimum parameters,
              startup of the network will fail. If the network fails
              to start for this reason, the logical NET$STARTUP_STATUS
              is set to OFF-AUTOGENREQ. Set the parameters to the
              recommended values before you run net$configure.

        1.6 Privileges and Rights Identifiers

              Digital recommends that you install and configure DECnet-
              Plus from the SYSTEM account. If you are configuring from
              another account, make sure the account has the following
              privileges and rights identifiers in place before you
              begin.

              Required account privileges are as follows:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  NETMBX

              o  SYSPRV

              Required rights identifiers are as follows:

              o  NET$MANAGE

              o  NET$SECURITY

              o  NET$REGISTERDNSOBJECT

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If your account has the BYPASS privilege, then you do
                not need to grant these rights identifiers.

                ______________________________________________________

        1.7 Backing Up the System Disk

              Use the OpenVMS BACKUP utility to make a copy of the system
              disk.

        1.8 Notifying Users

              Inform users on the system that you plan to install a
              product and that they must log out.

              Use the reply/all command and be sure to indicate the exact
              time you plan to begin running the POLYCENTER Software
              Installation utility. For example:

              $ set logins/interactive=0
              $ reply/all "Installing software at 18:00; Please log out."

              If possible, give users an estimated time when they will be
              able to log in to the system.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The DECnet-Plus base components, FTAM, OSAK, and VT,
                are all packaged as separate installation kits on
                the distribution medium. They are usually located
                in the same directory. The X.25 for OpenVMS Alpha
                kit, however, is a separately licensed product
                and as such is in a different directory on the
                distribution medium. Consult the documentation with
                your distribution medium for the location of the kits
                you desire.

                ______________________________________________________

              Use the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility to install
              the base components and any combination of optional
              components. See Appendix A for information on using the
              DCL interface with the POLYCENTER Software Installation
              utility.

        3.1 Recommended Order for Installing Software

              The following sections describe the order in which you
              should install the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS software for
              either an Alpha or VAX system.

        3.1.1 Installing DECnet-Plus for an OpenVMS Alpha System

              If you choose to install all the software products
              at the same time, install and configure the OpenVMS
              operating system and layered products in the following
              order, referring to the appropriate documentation. For a
              quick reference, see Figure 3-1. After OpenVMS has been
              installed, perform the following steps:

              1. Inspect the distribution kit.

              2. Verify that all prerequisite software and licenses are
                 installed.

                 Refer to the OpenVMS system documentation set.

              3. Shut down all network-related applications and tell

                                                    Configuration Options


              This chapter explains the three configuration options you
              can use to configure your system for DECnet-Plus. These
              configuration options enable you to configure the DECnet-
              Plus for OpenVMS base components so that the system becomes
              a DECnet-Plus end system on a network.

              The procedure you use to configure your system for DECnet-
              Plus is sys$manager:net$configure.com. You can use any of
              the following net$configure configuration options:

              o  FAST configuration option (Chapter 5)

                 The FAST configuration allows you to quickly upgrade
                 a non-clustered system from DECnet Phase IV to DECnet
                 Phase V.

              o  BASIC configuration option (Chapter 6)

                 The BASIC configuration allows you to configure your
                 system for DECnet-Plus by answering a few questions and
                 using the default answers on others.

              o  ADVANCED configuration option (DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
                 Applications Installation and Advanced Configuration
                 guide)

                 The ADVANCED configuration allows you to customize your
                 system's network configuration.

              This chapter presents additional information about the
              following topics:

              o  Selecting a configuration option

              o  Running net$configure

              See Section 1.6 for a list of account privileges you need
              to run net$configure.

        4.1 Selecting a Configuration Option

              If you installed the required software, you can configure
              your system using the net$configure configuration option
              for the FAST configuration, using the net$configure basic
              configuration option for the BASIC configuration, or using
              the net$configure advanced configuration option for the
              ADVANCED configuration.

              Table 4-1 provides some guidelines for making your
              configuration choice.

              If you choose to use either the FAST configuration option
              or the BASIC configuration option, continue with this
              section. If you prefer to customize your system's network
              configuration with the ADVANCED configuration option, refer
              to the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS Applications Installation
              and Advanced Configuration guide.

        FAST      You are upgrading from a DECnet Phase IV node and you
                  plan to use the existing Phase IV configuration.

                  The node is not in a cluster.

                  You are running the configuration procedure for the
                  first time.

        _________________________________________________________________

        BASIC     The node is in a cluster.

                  You are upgrading or reconfiguring DECnet-Plus.

                  You need to access a DECdns server for network
                  addresses.

                  You want to run DECnet over TCP/IP (RFC 1859) and/or
                  OSI applications over TCP/IP (RFC 1006).

                  You only have one communications device, or you
                  have multiple devices, all of which will be used for
                  DECnet-Plus communications.

                  You want to use the default names for all devices and
                  routing circuits.

                  You want to autoconfigure your network addresses only.

                  You want to configure both the NSP and OSI transports
                  and only want to create default OSI templates. You want
                  to enable both DECnet over TCP/IP or OSI applications
                  over TCP/IP.

                  You do not want to enable FDDI large packet support (if
                  you have an FDDI-type circuit).

                  You want to set the routing characteristic DNA
                  Address Format to TRUE (this attribute controls the
                  interpretation of address structuring).

                  You want to use integrated mode routing.

        4.2 How to Run NET$CONFIGURE

              The net$configure.com procedure configures the DECnet-Plus
              for OpenVMS software. This command creates or modifies
              the Network Control Language (NCL) scripts required to run
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS on your node.

              The net$configure.com procedure is an interactive procedure
              that displays a series of questions. After each question,
              the default response, if there is one, appears in brackets

              ([ ]). At the end of each question, a colon (:) appears.
              Respond in one of the following ways:

              o  To get help after a question, type a question mark (?).
                 After the help display, the same question reappears.

              o  To select the default response, press Return.

              o  To enter information, type it immediately after the
                 colon or question mark; then press Return.

              o  Type Y for YES and N for NO.

              o  To terminate the procedure, press Ctrl/Y.

              If you execute net$configure.com without specifying BASIC
              or ADVANCED, the BASIC configuration option is invoked by
              default.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you are running the configuration procedure for
                the first time on a system that was previously
                configured for Phase IV and you do not specify
                BASIC or ADVANCED, the initial default is the FAST
                configuration procedure.

                However, the FAST configuration procedure can only
                be run once on a system, and after that the BASIC
                configuration procedure automatically becomes the
                default.

                ______________________________________________________

              To invoke net$configure.com with the default BASIC option,
              enter the following:

              $ @sys$manager:net$configure

        4.2.1 Local and Global Symbols

              The net$configure.com procedure deletes all of your local
              and global symbols at the beginning of the procedure in
              order to free the symbol table. This happens because
              net$configure.com creates and uses a large number of
              symbols. If the symbols were not deleted at the beginning
              of the procedure, net$configure would often run out of
              symbol table space to use while configuring the system.

              Although net$configure.com can be run simultaneously
              on different nodes in a cluster, it should not be run
              simultaneously from different processes on the same node.

              This chapter describes how to configure the DECnet-Plus for
              OpenVMS base components using the FAST configuration option
              so that the system becomes a DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS end
              system on a network.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you have already run the FAST configuration
                procedure once on your system, the configuration
                procedure automatically defaults to the BASIC
                configuration procedure.

        5.1 Invoking the FAST Configuration Option

              To invoke the net$configure.com procedure using the FAST
              configuration option, enter the following command:

              $ @sys$manager:net$configure  <Return>

              The procedure starts:

        Using the FAST Configuration Option
        5.1 Invoking the FAST Configuration Option


                   You have the option of using the existing Phase IV information
                   to quickly configure DECnet-Plus. This provides full network access
                   and uses a local file to hold naming information. Very few questions
                   will be asked.
                   If you want to use the fast configuration option, answer YES to the next
                   question.

                   If you are running a DNS Server on this system, or plan to run a DNS
                   Server on this system, you *must* answer NO to the next question.
                   If you want more flexibility when configuring DECnet-Plus, also answer
                   NO.

                   Answering NO will cause some additional questions to be asked
                   regarding configuration.

              * Do you want the fast default configuration?          [YES] :  <Return>

              Press Return to continue with the FAST configuration
              option.

        5.2 Changing a Current DECnet-Plus System Configuration

              You can use the net$configure procedure to modify the
              current configuration. Depending on which menu option you
              select, net$configure either modifies the configuration
              automatically or produces modified NCL scripts that you can
              use to modify the system's configuration.

              See Chapter 4 to determine whether you want to use the
              BASIC or ADVANCED configuration option to change your
              configuration. Refer to the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
              Applications Installation and Advanced Configuration for
              instructions on how to run the ADVANCED configuration.

              This chapter describes how to configure the DECnet-Plus
              for OpenVMS base components using the BASIC configuration
              option so that the system becomes a DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
              end system on a network.

              The BASIC configuration option allows you to configure your
              system by answering a few questions and using the default
              answers on others.

              If you have already configured the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
              software and you want to customize the configuration, see
              Chapter 4 to determine if you want to use the BASIC or
              ADVANCED option.

        6.1 Invoking the BASIC Configuration Option

              To invoke the net$configure.com procedure using the BASIC
              configuration option, enter the following command:

              $ @sys$manager:net$configure basic

              The procedure starts:

                  DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS BASIC network configuration procedure

              This procedure will help you create or modify the management scripts
              needed to operate DECnet on this machine. You may receive help about
              most questions by answering with a question mark '?'.

              You have chosen the BASIC configuration option.  This option enables
              you to quickly configure your system by answering a few questions and
              using most of the default answers.  If you would rather do some specific
              tailoring of your  system's network configuration, you should invoke
              NET$CONFIGURE.COM with the ADVANCED configuration option, ie:
                             @SYS$MANAGER:NET$CONFIGURE ADVANCED

        Using the BASIC Configuration Option
        6.1 Invoking the BASIC Configuration Option


              Press Return to continue with the BASIC configuration
              option.

              The procedure informs you that this is the first time you
              are configuring your system to use DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS:

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-SETUPNEW, setting up for new configuration

              If a Phase IV database exists on the system, the procedure
              displays the following message:

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-PHASEIVDATA, Phase IV DECnet database found

              You have the option of using the existing Phase IV database
              to generate the Network Control Language (NCL) scripts
              and configure the system. If you do not want to use the
              existing Phase IV database to generate the NCL scripts
              and configure the system, then net$configure configures
              the system based on your answers to the configuration
              questions.

              * Do you want to convert Phase IV database?           [YES] :

              If you answer YES, the net$configure procedure uses the
              system's existing Phase IV database to generate NCL scripts
              and configure the system.

              If you answer NO, the net$configure procedure does not
              use the system's existing Phase IV database to generate
              NCL scripts and proceeds to ask all the configuration
              questions, starting with the directory services to use
              on the system. If you need more information to answer a
              question, you can type a question mark (?) at the prompts.
              Review the installation planning checklist in Chapter 2
              before continuing.

        6.2 Directory Name Services

              DECnet-Plus provides access to the node name and addressing
              information stored in one or more name services. This
              release of DECnet-Plus supports the following directory
              name services:

              o  Local namespace - A discrete, nondistributed namespace
                 that stores name and address information locally in
                 database files, the Local namespace replaces the DECdns
                 Local Naming Option (LNO). It also has the ability to
                 hold 100,000 nodes, and can scale beyond that number.

                 The actual number of nodes that the Local namespace can
                 hold depends on the space available on your system.
                 For more detailed information on namespaces, see
                 Section 7.1.1.

              o  DECdns distributed namespace - Digital's Distributed
                 Name Service, DECdns is a distributed, global name
                 service. For more information, see Section 7.1.2.

              o  Domain Name System - The Domain Name System (DNS/BIND)
                 is supported for storage of IP addresses. For more
                 information, see Section 7.1.3.

              If you choose to enter more than one directory name
              service for your system, enter them in order of priority.
              The ordering of this list is very important: the first
              directory service entered in this list is considered the
              primary directory service to use on the system. The primary
              directory service is considered the first choice to use
              when looking up naming information for the system.

              Enter an ordered list of the directory services you want
              to use on the system. If you enter more than one directory
              service, separate each service with a comma.

              * Enter the directory services to use on the system [LOCAL,DECDNS,DOMAIN] :

        6.2.1 Node Full Name

              The DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS configuration procedure
              net$configure.com prompts you for the system's full name.
              You can enter a DECdns full name, a Local namespace full
              name, a fully qualified host name for the Domain Name
              System (DNS/BIND), or all three. For DECdns and Local
              namespace full names, you must specify a node full name
              that includes a namespace nickname (this complies with
              DECdns distributed namespace requirements). The full name
              format is the same for distributed namespaces and Local
              namespaces.

              The full name uses the following form:

              NamespaceNickname:.DirectoryPath.NodeObject

              The following are the guidelines for selecting a full name:

              o  For DECdns and Local, the node full name must begin with
                 the namespace nickname and a colon (:). The nickname for
                 the Local namespace is always LOCAL: (or local:).

        Using the BASIC Configuration Option
        6.2 Directory Name Services


              o  For DECdns and Local, the directory path must begin with
                 a dot (.).

              o  The full name can be up to 511 characters long: the
                 namespace nickname can be up to 255 characters, and
                 the directory path and node object can be up to 255
                 characters.

              o  The full name can be any combination of letters, digits,
                 and certain punctuation characters from the ISO Latin-
                 1 character set. Some other characters are allowed as
                 long as they are enclosed in quotation marks. For a list
                 of all allowable characters, refer to the DECnet-Plus
                 DECdns Management guide.

              o  For DNS/BIND, enter a fully qualified IP host name.

              The following are some examples of suitable node full
              names:

              AU:.chemistry$lab.Sunil$Sethi
              XYZ_CORP:.sales.east_coast.BrianMacKrill
              Mbi:.MIS.Europe.Monaco_headquarters.F_Riviera
              local:.bryan
              smilee.mass.acme.edu

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you plan to use a Local namespace and you are
                converting a Phase IV system to DECnet-Plus, Digital
                recommends that you use the system's Phase IV node
                name in the DECnet-Plus full name (for example,
                LOCAL:.PASTRY).

                ______________________________________________________

              You should plan node full names carefully and make sure
              they are unique within the namespace. If your network
              administrator has not assigned a unique node full name
              for your system, be sure to read the DECnet-Plus Planning
              Guide before you assign a node name for your system. For
              more information on name services, see Chapter 7.

              At the prompt, enter a node full name for each directory
              service chosen. The node full name is the name of your
              system's node object in the directory service. It includes
              the namespace nickname and the full list of directories

              leading to the node object name. Examples of node full
              names include:

               Local namespace -  LOCAL:.TomThumb
               DECdns          -  ACME:.wabbit.Elmer
               Domain          -  elmer.wabbit.acme.edu

              For the Local namespace, the namespace nickname LOCAL is
              prepended to the full name and is terminated with a colon
              (:). The namespace nickname LOCAL means that the Local
              namespace is used. The node object name must begin with
              a dot (.), and no element of the name (namespace name,
              directory, or node object name) can be a null string.
              Note that the namespace nickname LOCAL is reserved, and
              indicates that the Local namespace is used on this system.
              For example, if you enter "Local,DECdns,Domain" at the
              previous prompt, you will be asked for a DECdns full name,
              a Local full name, and a fully qualified host name for DNS
              /BIND.

              * Enter the full name for directory service LOCAL   : LOCAL:.ELMER

              * Enter the full name for directory service DECDNS  : ACME:.WABBIT.ELMER

              * Enter the fully qualified host name for DNS/BIND  : ELMER.WABBIT.ACME.EDU

        6.2.2 Specifying the Node Type

              Prior to DECnet-Plus Version 7.1, DECnet-Plus systems were
              end nodes. Dedicated routers on the network performed
              routing functions for the end nodes as necessary. With
              the Version 7.1 release, DECnet-Plus allows a system to
              run integrated IS-IS, thus providing host-based routing
              functionality. The default is to be an end node.

              * What type of node (Endnode or Router)?           [ENDNODE] :

        6.2.3 Specifying Routing Information

              This section only applies if your DECnet-Plus system is a
              router.

              * Type of routing node (L1 or L2)?                      [L1] :

              Enter L1 if your DECnet-Plus system will provide intra-area
              level 1 routing capability. Enter L2 if your DECnet-Plus
              system will provide inter-area level 2 routing capability.
              The default is to be a level 1 router.

        Using the BASIC Configuration Option
        6.2 Directory Name Services


        6.2.4 Node Synonym

              The node synonym is an alphanumeric character string
              between one and six characters long. The first character
              must be an alphabetic character; after the first character,
              the string can contain either alphabetic or numeric
              characters.

              The node synonym is primarily a transition tool that allows
              you to use a Phase IV-style node name for your DECnet-
              Plus node. Other users can then find your node by using
              this synonym rather than your full name. If you were using
              DECnet Phase IV, consider using your Phase IV node name
              as your synonym. The synonym is required for Phase IV
              applications that can only handle Phase IV-style node
              names. If your network has only DECnet-Plus or OSI (Open
              Systems Interconnection) systems, you may not need a node
              synonym.

              The default node synonym is the first six characters of
              the system's last simple name. The last simple name is
              the string that follows the last period of your full
              name. For example, if you specify XYZ_CORP:.sales.east_
              coast.BrianMacKrill as a node full name, the default node
              synonym is BrianM.

              If this system had previously been running DECnet Phase IV
              software, then you should use the old Phase IV node name as
              the synonym. If this system is joining a DECnet network for
              the first time, you can use any name for the synonym, as
              long as it meets the criteria listed above, and is unique
              within the network.

              * What is the synonym name for this node?            [ELMER] :

              For more information on node synonym directories, see
              Section 7.4.

        6.2.5 Specifying a DECnet Phase IV-Compatible Address

              If you want your system to communicate with Phase IV
              nodes, you must specify a Phase IV address and a Phase
              IV prefix. These will be used to construct a DECnet Phase
              IV-compatible address.

        6-6 Using the BASIC Configuration Option

 



                                     Using the BASIC Configuration Option
                                              6.2 Directory Name Services


              A DECnet Phase IV-compatible address is a DECnet-Plus
              address (NSAP - network service access point) that conforms
              to the Phase IV area and node limits; that is, the area
              number is from 1 to 63, and the node number is from 1 to
              1023.

              If there are no Phase IV systems on your network or you do
              not want to communicate with Phase IV systems, you do not
              need a Phase IV-compatible address. Entering a Phase IV
              address of 0.0 at configuration time indicates that this
              DECnet-Plus system will not have a Phase IV-compatible
              address, and will not communicate with Phase IV nodes.

              * Enter PhaseIV Address                              [15.27] :

              Enter the Phase IV address you want to use, or enter 0.0 if
              you do not want to communicate with Phase IV nodes.

        6.2.6 Specifying a Phase IV Prefix

              The net$configure basic configuration option provides 49::
              as the default value for the Phase IV prefix. If you do not
              enter a Phase IV-compatible address, you will not have a
              Phase IV prefix.

        6.2.7 Configuring Network Addresses

              The net$configure basic configuration option autoconfigures
              one network address for you.

        6.2.8 DNA Address Format

              The net$configure basic configuration sets the routing
              characteristic DNA address format to TRUE.

        6.3 Configuring Devices

              The net$configure procedure checks for network devices on
              the system that are supported by net$configure and then
              configures them. If the procedure finds that you have WANDD
              or X.25 installed but not configured, you will see the
              following information:

              You have installed wide area device support, but it has not been
              configured.  You may configure it now if you want.

              * Do you want to configure Wide Area devices?          [YES] : N

              For an Alpha system, the procedure displays the following
              information:

              DEC X.25 software has been installed on this system.  You have
              the option of configuring DECnet to run over X.25.

              * Do you want to configure DECnet over X.25?            [NO] :

              Answer YES if you want to configure DECnet over X.25.

              If you answer YES, you will see a list of choices for the
              type of X.25 circuit to use:

                   Types of X.25 circuits:

                   [1] - X.25 Dynamic Assigned (DA)
                   [2] - X.25 Static Incoming (IN)
                   [3] - X.25 Static Outgoing (OUT)
                   [4] - X.25 Permanent (PVC)

              * Which type of X.25 circuit do you want to use?             : 4
              * Routing Circuit Name to use?                   [X25-PVC-0] :
              * Template name?                                 [X25-PVC-0] :
              * Configure another X.25 routing circuit for DECnet?    [NO] :

              Enter the number for the type of circuit you want, then
              enter a routing circuit name and a template name to use
              for that circuit. If you do not want to configure any other
              X.25 routing circuits, press Return for the default. The
              configuration procedure continues with the next series of
              questions (such as time zone or transports, for example).

              If no devices are found on the Alpha system, the procedure
              displays the following prompt:

              * Should a SYSMAN IO AUTO be executed?                       :

              If you answer YES, the net$configure procedure invokes the
              SYSMAN IO AUTO command to find devices on the system. If
              you answer NO, there are no devices to configure.

              If you answer YES to the question, "Do you want to
              configure Wide Area devices?" and you are using a VAX
              system, the procedure displays the following information:

              * Do you want to configure Wide Area devices?          [YES] :

              Answer YES if you want to configure DECnet over P.S.I.

              If you answer YES, the procedure displays the following:

                 This is the Configuration Procedure for the
                 ===========================================

                       VAX Wan Device Drivers for DECnet/OSI for VMS
                       =============================================

                The Wide Area Network Datalinks and Drivers are  a  prerequisite
                for  DECnet/OSI.  They  also  provide  synchronous  datalinks in
                systems that do not use DECnet/OSI for networking.

                Access to DECnet/OSI datalinks (created by NCL) is  possible via
                the QIO interface to the WAN pseudo-driver, WANDRIVER.   Layered
                products  that use synchronous devices  do not  normally require
                programming  access to WANDRIVER.  For  further information, see
                the "DECnet/OSI for VMS WANDD Programming" guide.

              Do you wish to use WANDRIVER [N] ? y
              Will you use DEC HDLC [Y] ?
              Will you use LAPB/E (VAX P.S.I. requires LAPB/E) [Y] ?

                The DSV11 (Q-bus), DIV32 (Q-bus), DSB32 (BI-bus), DSF32 (MI-bus) and
                DSW devices are soft-loadable. The WANDD startup procedure will load
                the microcode for these devices if required.

              Do you have any soft-loadable microcode devices on this system [N] ?
              Will you use the VAXft DSF32 device driver [N] ? y

                The  VAXft  DSF32  software  supports the  pairing  of  physical
                controllers to  provide  a fault-tolerant  configuration. Such a
                pairing  is  called  a  Failover Set. The  DSF32 device does not
                automatically create the failover sets, so you will need to pair
                controllers using the Failover Set Manager software.

                This  management  software can be  invoked during system startup
                from within the command procedure WANDD$STARTUP_SF.COM, which is
                placed  in  the SYS$STARTUP  directory  by the  kit installation
                procedure. If you want to have these Failover Sets automatically
                configured  when  the system  starts up  you will need to modify
                WANDD$STARTUP_SF.COM to  include  Failover Set Manager commands
                that you require.

              Are you satisfied with the answers you have given [Y] ?

                If you have already started up the  WAN  Drivers  and  Datalinks
                (that    is,    if    you    have   already   successfully   run
                SYS$STARTUP:WANDD$STARTUP.COM  since  your   system   was   last
                booted),  then  you will need to reboot your system for your new
                configuration to take effect.

              *  Configure another X.25 routing circuit for DECnet?   [NO] :

              The procedure continues to ask for information. See
              Section 6.3.1 for the types of questions you will see and
              possible responses you can enter.

              If no devices are found on the VAX system, the procedure
              displays the following prompt:

              * Should a SYSGEN AUTOCONFIGURE ALL be executed?             :

              If you answer YES, the net$configure procedure invokes
              the SYSGEN AUTOCONFIGURE ALL command to find devices on
              the system. If you answer NO, there are no devices to
              configure.

        6.4 Configuring Transports

              Next, the NSP transport and the OSI transport are
              configured.

              The procedure displays the following message to indicate
              that the default OSI templates have been created:

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-CREDEFOSITEMPLATE, created default OSI templates

              The default OSI templates are used by the OSAK and FTAM
              installation verification procedures (IVPs) for loopback
              testing. You will not be able to use OSI applications
              to make connections to other OSI systems unless you use
              the net$configure advanced configuration option to create
              additional OSI templates. You can do this at a later time.

        6.5 Configuring Time Zone Differential Factors

              The UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is calculated
              automatically by using the OpenVMS UTC, and the procedure
              displays the following message:

              Determining DTSS timezone rules from OpenVMS information...

              After the initial system configuration, you can choose to
              reconfigure the system's time zone rule (TZR) by selecting
              Option 5 in the top-level net$configure menu in either the
              BASIC or ADVANCED configuration procedure.

              The procedure creates the DECnet-Plus default applications
              to include in the application database. The procedure
              creates default user accounts for the CML, MAIL, VPM,
              MIRROR, and PHONE applications (no account is created for
              FAL):

                 Information Protocol (DNA CMIP). CML provides access to
                 CMIP.

              o  MAIL allows users to send and receive messages.

              o  VMScluster Performance Monitor (VPM) needs an account
                 for your system to support the OpenVMS Monitor utility

              o  MIRROR is needed for particular forms of loopback
                 testing.

              o  PHONE allows users on the same or different OpenVMS
                 systems to communicate interactively.

        6.8 Configuring a Cluster Alias

              The following steps describe how to configure a cluster
              alias.

              1. If the node is a OpenVMS Cluster member or if
                 net$configure finds an alias NCL script on the system,
                 the procedure prompts you to enter the full name of a
                 cluster alias.

                  * Full name of Cluster Alias             : ACME:.WABBIT.HELP

                 If you do not want the node to participate in a cluster
                 alias, press Return.

                 If you want the node to participate in a cluster alias,
                 specify the full name that uniquely identifies the
                 cluster alias node (for example, ACME:.WABBIT.HELP).

              2. If you entered a cluster alias full name in response
                 to the previous prompt, the procedure displays the
                 following prompt:

                 * Cluster Alias Phase IV Address (aa.nnnn OR AA-00-04-00-xx-xx) : 12.139

                                     Using the BASIC Configuration Option
                                         6.8 Configuring a Cluster Alias


                 Do not use your address for the cluster alias. If you
                 are unsure which address to enter, consult your network
                 manager.

                 Specify either the DECnet Phase IV node address or
                 Ethernet physical address of the alias.

                 The Phase IV node address has the format area-
                 number.node-number (for example, 12.139).

                 The Ethernet physical address has the format AA-00-
                 04-00-xx-xx, where xx-xx is calculated from the Phase
                 IV node address. To determine the Ethernet physical
                 address, proceed as follows:

                 a. Convert the Phase IV node address to its decimal
                    equivalent as follows:

                    (area-number * 1024) + node-number = decimal equivalent
                    (For example, (12 * 1024) + 139 = 12427 decimal)

                 b. Convert the decimal node address to its hexadecimal
                    equivalent and reverse the order of the bytes to form
                    the hexadecimal node address. For example:

                    (12427 decimal = 308B hex, reversed = 8B30 hexnodeaddress)

                 c. Incorporate the hexadecimal node address in the
                    following format:

                    AA-00-04-00-hexnodeaddress
                    (For example, AA-00-04-00-8B-30)

              3. If you entered a cluster alias full name and a Phase IV
                 address, the procedure displays the following prompt:

                 * Selection weight for this cluster node [0 for satellites]  :

                 The selection weight determines the number of sequential
                 incoming connects passed to this alias member node in
                 the round-robin sequence before proceeding to the next
                 member node in the sequence. A value of zero means this
                 node is not eligible to receive incoming connections to
                 this alias address. Selection weight apportions incoming
                 alias connections according to the capacity of each
                 alias member. For example, nodes with greater capacity
                 should have larger values of selection weight, while
                 OpenVMS Cluster satellites should generally have a value
                 of zero. Specify a nonzero selection weight if this node
                 is connected locally to a dual-ported disk, or if it

                 HSC-connected disks, to other cluster members. Digital
                 recommends values between 0 and 10.

              4. The procedure then displays:

                 Answer YES to accept the configuration you just
                 specified. The procedure automatically generates the

              You can use the net$configure procedure to modify the
              current configuration. Depending on which menu option you
              select, net$configure either modifies the configuration
              automatically or produces modified NCL scripts that you can
              use to modify the system's configuration.

              See Chapter 4 to determine whether you want to use the
              FAST, BASIC or ADVANCED configuration option to change
              your configuration. Refer to the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS

              If this is the first time you are configuring the DECnet-
              Plus for OpenVMS software on your system, the information
              in this chapter further explains some of the topics that
              appear as you run the configuration procedure.

        7.1 Names Services Overview

              While configuring DECnet-Plus, the system administrator
              specifies one or more of the following directory name
              services to use on the node: the Local namespace, DECdns,
              or Domain Name System (for DNS/BIND). See Section 6.2 for
              more information.

              o  Local namespace - A discrete, nondistributed namespace
                 that stores name and address information locally in
                 database files. DECnet-Plus includes a Local namespace.

              o  DECdns - Digital's Distributed Name Service, a
                 distributed, global name service.

              o  Domain Name System - The Domain Name System (DNS/BIND)
                 supported for storage of IP addresses.

              For more information on name services, refer to the DECnet-
              Plus Planning Guide.

        7.1.1 The Local Namespace

              DECnet-Plus includes a Local namespace, independent of
              DECdns, that is designed to scale to at least 100,000
              nodes.

              The Local namespace is a discrete, nondistributed namespace
              that exists on a single node and provides that node with
              a local database of name and address information. The
              prefix LOCAL: (or local:) is reserved to indicate that the
              information for the node is stored in the Local namespace.

        Managing Name Services
        7.1 Names Services Overview


              DECnet-Plus recognizes that when a node full name begins
              with LOCAL:, information for that node is stored in a
              Local namespace. The following are typical node full names
              properly formatted for the Local namespace: LOCAL:.xyz.abc
              and local:.maximum.

              Unlike DECdns, the Local namespace does not employ
              backtranslation directories for address-to-node-name
              translation.

        7.1.1.1 Creating a Local Namespace

              If you want to create a Local namespace, enter
              LOCAL:.DirectoryPath.NodeObject at the following prompt:

              * Enter the full name for directory service LOCAL:

              The directory path identifies the namespace subdirectory
              (if any). The node object is the system's node name.

        7.1.1.2 Managing the Local Namespace

              The DECdns distributed namespace is not a requirement
              for DECnet-Plus and the Local namespace is not dependent
              on DECdns. However, the DECdns clerk software is still
              required on each node. You cannot use the DECdns Control
              Program (DNSCP) to manage information stored in the Local
              namespace. Instead, use decnet_register to manage the node
              name and address information stored in your namespace. The
              decnet_register tool is described in the DECnet-Plus for
              OpenVMS Network Management guide.

        7.1.2 The Digital Distributed Name Service (DECdns)

              DECdns is a networkwide service that makes it possible
              to use network resources without knowing their physical
              location. Users and applications can assign DECnet-Plus
              names to resources such as nodes. The creator of a name
              also supplies other relevant information, such as the
              resource's network address, for DECdns to store. Users then
              need to remember only the name, and DECdns acts as a lookup
              service, providing the rest of the data when necessary.

        7.1.2.1 Creating a New Namespace

              You need to create a new DECdns namespace only if you are
              configuring the first DECdns server for the network or if
              you are creating an additional namespace. If you already
              have a DECdns namespace, you do not need to create a new
              namespace to be able to run DECnet-Plus. However, if this
              is the first system in a network where no namespace exists
              and you do not intend to use the Local namespace, you must
              create (and populate) a DECdns namespace.

              If you are unsure whether you need to create a new
              namespace or configure your system as a server, see your
              network manager. For information about namespace planning,
              refer to the DECnet-Plus Planning Guide.

              To create a new namespace while configuring a DECnet-Plus
              for OpenVMS system:

              o  The DECdns server software must be installed on the
                 system.

              o  DECdns must be specified as one of the naming services
                 configured on the system.

              When you create a namespace, you need a namespace nickname
              and clearinghouse name. The namespace nickname is part of
              the full name of every subsequent system in the network and
              should be unique to your network. The namespace nickname
              that you specify becomes the actual name of the namespace.
              A clearinghouse is a collection of directory replicas that
              contains the names and addresses of objects (for example,
              servers, clerks, files).

              Digital recommends that you create namespace
              directories before using the configuration procedure
              (net$configure.com) to create the namespace. Follow these
              steps to create namespace directories:

              1. Invoke decnet_register and select option 10 ("Manage the
                 directory service").

              2. Follow directions. Be sure to specify DECdns as the
                 directory service to manage (the Local namespace is
                 the default). The decnet_register procedure invokes
                 sys$manager:decnet_register_decdns.com to create the
                 namespace directories.

        7.1 Names Services Overview


              3. When finished, invoke the configuration procedure to
                 create the new namespace.

              For more information on decnet_register, refer to DECnet-
              Plus for OpenVMS Network Management.

        7.1.2.2 Creating a DECdns Namespace

              If you select DECdns as a directory service, net$configure
              prompts you for the full name you want to use:

              * Enter the full name for directory service DECDNS:   new_ns:.mrv042 <Return>

              If this is a new namespace, net$configure prompts you for
              more information once the configuration procedure completes
              and you have started the network. The startup information
              will be similar to the following:

              %NET$STARTUP-I-OPERSTATUS, DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS operational status is RUNNING-
              MAJOR

              The namespace you specified was NEW_NS.

              %DNS-E-NOMATNS, The specified namespace is not being served on your LAN.
                      please choose from the following list

               [1]  BB_NS
               [2]  DOMAIN
               [3]  LOCAL
               [4]  X500

               [0]  - Reject this list -

               Pick a number from the list: 0  <Return>

              Because you are creating a new namespace, the namespace
              you specified at the prompt, "What is the full name of this
              node?" does not appear in the list. To continue, enter 0
              and press Return to reject the list.

                     If you are installing DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS for the first time
                     and you want to create a namespace, type Y.  If you want to
                     attempt a WAN connection to a remote DECdns server,
                     type N (default) at the following prompt:

              Do you want to proceed with creating a new namespace [n]: y <Return>

              At this point, the configuration procedure needs to
              determine whether you intend to configure your system as
              a clerk on a WAN (connect to an off-LAN server) or create
              a new namespace. Since you cannot create a new namespace
              unless you have installed DECdns server software on the
              system, the procedure first verifies that the server
              software has been installed.

              If you want to create a new namespace, type YES at the
              prompt and press Return. The procedure continues prompting
              you for information necessary to create the namespace
              and the appropriate directories. The procedure displays
              information about the namespace, the directories, and other
              network parameters, then tells you when the configuration
              is complete.

                     Your next input will determine the name of the clearinghouse
                     in your namespace new_ns.  Enter the clearinghouse name as
                     alphanumeric and/or underscore characters.

              Enter a simple name for the clearinghouse: .mrv042_new_ns_ch  <Return>

              The DECdns namespace groups and directories will now be created.  This might
              take up to 6 minutes or more, depending on the speed of the DECdns

              DECdns namespace initialization for DECnet use is complete.

              If this is the first time you have initialized the namespace for DECnet
              use, use SYS$SYSTEM:DECNET_REGISTER.EXE to:

                - Create a command file to automatically register previously defined
                  Phase IV nodes.  Execute this command file before you manually
                  register any other nodes using SYS$SYSTEM:DECNET_REGISTER.EXE.

                - Create any directories you need for node names that should be registered
                  immediately, according to your namespace design.  This includes the node
                  you are currently running on.

                - Be sure to add backtranslation directories for any non PhaseIV areas/IPDs.
                  Failure to do so will lead to Backtranslation Failures.  Once you've added
                  the necessary backtranslation directories, you may need to use the
                  ncl flush session control naming cache entry "*" command.

                - Change the local node's registered name from its default name to its
                  final full name.  The local node will be registered as a Phase IV node
                  with a default name when you execute the Phase IV node registration
                  command file above.

                - Change the currently registered names of other nodes from their default
                  names to their final full names when appropriate (for example, when they
                  are upgraded to run DECnet-Plus software).

              Continue to use SYS$SYSTEM:DECNET_REGISTER.EXE to:

                - Create any additional directories you need for node names, as new nodes
                  are brought up on the network.

                - Register new nodes as they are brought up on the network.

                - Add members to the NEW_NS:.DNA_Registrar access control group.

              Additionally, you can use the DECdns control utility to:

        Managing Name Services
        7.1 Names Services Overview


        7.1.4 Namespace Management

              DECnet-Plus includes a new in-memory naming cache to
              improve performance of name and address resolution for
              all supported name services. Refer to the DECnet-Plus for
              OpenVMS Network Management guide for more information.

              DECnet-Plus includes several new features to ease namespace
              management including decnet_register (a new namespace
              management tool), several new Network Control Language
              (NCL) commands, and Common Trace Facility (CTF) support for
              monitoring node name and address resolution.

              The decnet_register tool, an executable image located
              in SYS$SYSTEM:, centralizes and simplifies namespace
              management tasks by replacing functionality previously
              provided by both the decnet_dns_register and decnet_
              loc_register command procedures, which were located in
              SYS$MANAGER:. The decnet_register tool manages information
              in both the DECdns distributed name service and the Local
              namespace. The decnet_register manage command assists with
              setting up tasks for the DECdns name service. For example,
              it creates namespace directories and access groups, and
              enables autoregistration. Refer to the section on decnet_
              register in the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS Network Management
              guide for more information.

        7.2 Name Service Search Path

              The name service search path applies systemwide and
              allows DECnet-Plus to search a list of name services in
              a predetermined order when looking up names or addressing
              information. The search path includes naming templates
              that tell DECnet-Plus how to interpret any abbreviated node
              names entered by users.

              The ordering of the name services is very important. The
              first name service listed is the primary name service
              to use on the system. The primary name service is the
              first choice used when looking up names and addressing
              information. The remaining name services listed are the
              secondary name services used on the system.

              The search path contains a list of name service keywords,
              each followed by a naming template that specifies a
              "defaulting rule" so users can enter shorter node names.

                                             7.2 Name Service Search Path


        7.2.1 Configuring the Search Path Information

              During DECnet-Plus configuration, the system administrator
              uses net$configure.com to set up one, two, or three name
              services on each node.

              From the information provided by the system administrator,
              net$configure creates NET$SEARCHPATH_STARTUP.NCL, the
              standard search path NCL startup script which contains
              the name service search path information for the node.

              The system administrator supplies one or two properly
              formatted DECnet-Plus node full names (in the case of the
              Local namespace and the DECdns distributed name service)
              and one fully qualified host name for DNS/BIND (if DNS/BIND
              is to be used on the node).

              The first full name is specified in the proper format for
              the name service to be searched first. The second and third
              node names are properly formatted for the name services to
              be searched second and last.

              If more than one name service is to be used on the node,
              the name services are searched in the order specified
              by the system administrator. For example, if the system
              administrator specifies Local, DECdns and Domain for the
              name services to use on the system, the Local namespace is
              searched before the DECdns namespace and DNS/BIND.

              The following configuration example illustrates how to
              upgrade to DECnet-Plus Version 7.1 and use the new name
              service access features. Invoke net$configure.com and
              select Option 2 ("Change node name/namespace name"). The
              following prompt is displayed:

              * Enter the directory services to use on the system [LOCAL,DECDNS,DOMAIN]:

              At the prompt, you can choose the following name services
              for the system: LOCAL, DECDNS, and DOMAIN. If you enter
              more than one name service, separate each name with commas.

              For example, entering DECDNS,LOCAL,DOMAIN at the prompt,
              means the following:

              o  You want to use the name services DECdns, Local, and
                 DNS/BIND.

              o  The primary name service is DECdns.

        Managing Name Services
        7.2 Name Service Search Path


              o  The secondary name services are Local and DNS/BIND, in
                 that order.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If your node is also a DECdns server, the primary name
                service must be DECdns.

                ______________________________________________________

        7.2.1.1 Naming Search Path in a Cluster

              All members in a cluster should have identical naming
              search paths configured. This will help to ensure that
              nodes are recognized in the various services you have
              identified.

              For example, if you receive mail on one node in the
              cluster, the "from" node name would be LOCAL:.NODE::SMITH.
              If you attempt to reply to this node from a node in the
              cluster that does not have Local configured, the system
              would indicate that there is no such node.

        7.2.2 Displaying the Search Path Information

              The system maintains two separate search paths:

              o  One search path supports forward translation or naming
                 (node-name-to-address translation).

                 $ mcr ncl show session control naming search path

              o  Another separate search path supports backtranslation
                 (address-to-node-name translation).

                 $ mcr ncl show session control backtranslation search path

              Refer to DECnet-Plus OpenVMS Network Management for more
              information.

        7.2.3 Modifying the Search Path Information

              Digital recommends that you rerun net$configure.com to
              revise the standard search path NCL script (NET$SEARCHPATH_
              STARTUP.NCL) whenever it is necessary to reorder access
              to the name services on the node. To modify the standard
              search path startup script, run net$configure.com and use
              Option 2 ("Change node name/namespace name").

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Whenever you directly edit an existing NET$SEARCHPATH_
                STARTUP.NCL script, or when you use the NCL set
                command to change the script (rather than changing
                the script by rerunning net$configure.com), your
                edits are overwritten by any new NET$SEARCHPATH_
                STARTUP.NCL scripts you subsequently generate by
                rerunning net$configure.com.

                ______________________________________________________

        7.2.4 Creating a Site-Specific Search Path NCL Script

              Digital recommends that you allow net$configure.com (and in
              some cases net$startup.com) to create and use the standard
              NCL search path script (NET$SEARCHPATH_STARTUP.NCL).

              However, if you need to make site-specific changes to your
              search path NCL script and you do not want net$configure
              to overwrite these changes, you can create a site-specific
              search path NCL script by renaming the standard search
              path script (NET$SEARCHPATH_STARTUP.NCL) to NET$SEARCHPATH_
              LOCAL.NCL and making your changes to the new file.

              For example, you might want to use the NCL set command
              described in Section 7.2.6 to create site-specific naming
              templates in NET$SEARCHPATH_LOCAL.NCL.

              The net$configure.com and net$startup.com procedures check
              for the presence of a site-specific search path script
              (NET$SEARCHPATH_LOCAL.NCL) on the node. If NET$SEARCHPATH_
              LOCAL.NCL is present on the node, it is invoked instead of
              the standard script. A message similar to the following is
              displayed:

                 **************************************************************
                 A site-specific searchpath NCL script has been found on the
                 system (SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR]NET$SEARCHPATH_LOCAL.NCL;). The
                 configuration procedure will use this script to set the
                 searchpath instead of using the standard searchpath script
                 that is created by NET$CONFIGURE (NET$SEARCHPATH_STARTUP.NCL).
                 **************************************************************

        Managing Name Services
        7.2 Name Service Search Path


              The net$configure.com and net$startup.com procedures do
              not modify the site-specific search path NCL script;
              rather, they invoke the site-specific search path script
              as it currently exists. Therefore, when using a site-
              specific search path NCL script, you must modify it prior
              to invoking net$configure.com whenever you change any of
              the following name service information:

              o  The number of name services used on the node

              o  The order of the name services used on the node

              o  The specific name services used on the node

        7.2.5 Using the Search Path to Ease Migration

              A search path can be used to simplify migration from one
              name service to another. The system administrator can
              create a search path designating the currently used name
              service as the primary name service (to be searched first)
              and the new name service as the secondary name service
              (to be searched second after the primary name service is
              searched).

              As the secondary name service becomes populated with node
              and addressing information, the system administrator can
              rerun net$configure.com and select Option 2 to reverse the
              positions of the name services in the search path. This
              causes the current secondary service to become primary, to
              be searched first for node and addressing information.

        7.2.6 Setting Up Naming Templates

              In each template, the user-supplied portion of the name
              (usually the node's terminating name or rightmost simple
              name) is indicated with an asterisk (*). For example, if
              the DECdns template is: "ABCDE:.xyz.*" and a user supplies
              the name fin, then the following full name: ABCDE:.xyz.fin
              is looked up in namespace ABCDE in the DECdns name service.

              You should specify only one asterisk per template. Only
              the first occurrence of an asterisk (*) in the template is
              substituted with the user-supplied name. Any additional
              asterisks are passed to the name service as part of
              the full name. When you specify a template without an
              asterisk, the template string is passed to the name service
              unchanged.

                                             7.2 Name Service Search Path


              If the user-supplied name should be passed to the name
              service as entered by the user, the template should be
              specified as follows: "*".

              DECnet-Plus provides an NCL set command for modifying
              the naming templates associated with the naming and
              backtranslation search paths. Do not use the NCL set
              command to modify aspects of the search path other than
              the naming templates.

              The following NET$SEARCHPATH_LOCAL.NCL script creates
              typical naming and backtranslation search paths. In this
              script ABCDE represents the namespace nickname. Your
              namespace nickname will appear in your NCL script:

              SET NODE 0 SESSION CONTROL NAMING SEARCH PATH -
                      ([DIRECTORY SERVICE = LOCAL, TEMPLATE = "*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = LOCAL, TEMPLATE = "local:*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = LOCAL, TEMPLATE = "LOCAL:.*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DECDNS, TEMPLATE = "*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DECDNS, TEMPLATE = "ABCDE:*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DECDNS, TEMPLATE = "ABCDE:.xyz.*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DECDNS_SYNONYM, TEMPLATE = "ABCDE:.DNA_NodeSynonym.*"
                      ], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DOMAIN, TEMPLATE = "*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DOMAIN, TEMPLATE = "*.xyz.ABCDE.com"])
                      SET NODE 0 SESSION CONTROL BACK SEARCH PATH -
                      ([DIRECTORY SERVICE = LOCAL, TEMPLATE = ""], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DECDNS, TEMPLATE = "ABCDE:.DNA_BackTranslation"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DOMAIN, TEMPLATE = ""])

        7.3 Domain Synonyms

              Support for the Domain Name System (DNS/BIND) provides
              for the use of node synonyms. This allows for backward
              compatibility with older applications that cannot use long
              domain names.

              There are two ways to configure node synonyms for use with
              DNS/BIND:

              o  By constructing an appropriate set of naming search path
                 templates

              o  By defining local aliases

        7.3.1 Search Path Naming Template Support for Domain Synonyms

              You can provide synonym support for entire domains by
              constructing an appropriate set of search path templates.
              Note that excessively long search paths (search paths with
              many entries) can increase the time it takes to look up
              node addresses. See Section 7.2 for general information on
              name service search paths.

              Entering the following NCL command sets up a search path
              for a system using DNS/BIND:

               $ mcr ncl set session control naming search path =                 -
                   { [Directory Service = Domain, Template = "*"],                -
                     [Directory Service = Domain, Template = "*.finbar.com"],     -
                     [Directory Service = Domain, Template = "*.abc.finbar.com"], -
                     [Directory Service = Domain, Template = "*.xyz.finbar.com"]}

              This NCL command results in the following DNS/BIND naming
              templates:

                *
                *.finbar.com
                *.abc.finbar.com
                *.xyz.finbar.com

              When DECnet-Plus receives a connection from node
              koi.abc.finbar.com, it determines that koi is a usable
              synonym for this node, and DECnet-Plus will return the name
              koi to applications that require Phase IV style node names.

              Using search path naming templates for synonym support
              allows the user to enter any of the following node names:
              koi, koi.abc, or koi.abc.finbar.com for node koi.

        7.3.2 Local Aliases

              Another way to define a node synonym for a particular node
              is by adding DNS/BIND alias names to the local host's
              database. The following is an example using Digital TCP
              /IP Services for OpenVMS:

              $ ucx set host koi.abc.finbar.com/address=aa.bb.cc.dd/alias=koi

              DECnet-Plus now returns the node synonym koi to
              applications that require Phase IV-style node names.

        7.4 Node Synonym Directories

              The default node synonym directory is .DNA_NodeSynonym.
              If you plan to use a node synonym directory other than
              this default directory, you must define the logical
              name DECNET_MIGRATE_DIR_SYNONYM to the synonym directory
              name you want to use in sys$manager:net$logicals.com.
              (If you do not have a sys$manager:net$logicals.com
              procedure on your system, you can create one using
              sys$manager:net$logicals.template.) This makes the
              definition permanent (that is, it will not be deleted when
              you reboot the system).

        7.4.1 Defining an Alternate Node Synonym Directory

              Use the following format to define an alternate node
              synonym directory:

              $ define decnet_migrate_dir_synonym "alt-directory-name"

              If you use a synonym directory name that includes special
              characters or three or more dots, the system might produce
              an error. To avoid this, enclose the synonym directory name
              in quotes. For example:

              $ define/system decnet_migrate_dir_synonym ".ch.noun.synonym"

              The net$configure procedure needs this logical name to be
              defined at all times if you wish to use a synonym directory
              other than .DNA_NodeSynonym. Be sure to add this definition
              to net$logicals.com to ensure that the definition of the
              synonym directory will be permanent.

        7.4.2 When to Use the Logical Name

              You can use the logical name described in Section 7.4.1 for
              either the BASIC or the ADVANCED configuration option.

              You must define this logical name before you use any of
              following procedures:

                 net$configure.com
                 decnet_register.exe
                 decnet_migrate.exe

        Managing Name Services
        7.4 Node Synonym Directories


              If synonym lookup fails in the namespace, the software does
              one of the following:

              o  The startup procedure defines SYS$NODE, SYS$CLUSTER_
                 NODE, or both to be the first six characters of the last
                 simple name of the respective node full name or cluster
                 full name.

              o  The configuration procedure defines SYS$NODE to be the
                 node synonym name that was entered during configuration.

              The system displays a message that it has redefined the
              logical names.

        7.5 Using a DNS Version 1 Namespace with DECdns Version 2

              If you are already using a namespace created with Version
              1 of the VAX Distributed Name Service (DNS) (running on
              DECnet Phase IV), you can continue to use the namespace
              when you upgrade your networking software to DECnet-Plus
              for OpenVMS. However, because of differences in the way
              that DNS Version 1 and DECdns Version 2 handle access
              control, you must prepare your DNS Version 1 namespace
              for use by DECnet-Plus. DNS Version 1 and DECdns Version
              2 interpret principal specifications in access control
              entries (ACEs) differently.

              In DNS Version 1, servers recognize principals only
              in the form nodename::username. In DECdns Version 2,
              servers recognize principals primarily in the form
              nodename.username. For DECdns Version 2 clerks and servers
              to interpret and process existing DNS Version 1-style
              access control entries in the namespace, you need to create
              a backtranslation directory (.DNA_BackTranslation) and
              a node synonym directory (.DNA_NodeSynonym) in the root
              directory of the namespace. You must then populate these
              directories by registering all the nodes participating in
              the Version 1 namespace.

                7.5 Using a DNS Version 1 Namespace with DECdns Version 2


        7.5.1 Preparing a DNS Version 1 Namespace for Use by DECdns
              Version 2

              To prepare a namespace created with DNS Version 1 for use
              by DECnet-Plus, follow these steps:

              1. Install and configure DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS on any
                 node in your namespace that is not currently functioning
                 as a DNS Version 1 server. Configure the node as a
                 DECdns Version 2 clerk. See Chapter 3 and Chapter 5
                 in this book if you plan to use the BASIC configuration
                 option, or the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS Applications
                 Installation and Advanced Configuration guide if you
                 plan to use the ADVANCED configuration option.

              2. From any node running DNS Version 1 server software,
                 use the DNS Version 1 control program (DNS$CONTROL) add
                 access command to grant the following DNS Version 1-
                 style access on behalf of the SYSTEM account on the new
                 Version 2 clerk node that you configured in Step 1:

                 o  Read, write, delete, test, and control access to the
                    root directory of the namespace

                 o  Read, write, delete, test, and control access to the
                    clearinghouse that stores the master replica of the
                    root directory

                 For example, if the DECnet-Plus full name of the new
                 clerk is .pastry, and the master replica of the Version
                 1 namespace is stored in the .paris_ch clearinghouse,
                 enter the following two commands:

                 DNS> add access pastry::system directory . /rights=(r,w,d,t,c)

                 DNS> add access pastry::system clearinghouse .paris_ch /rights=(r,w,d,t,c)

                 You need to grant this access to ensure that the SYSTEM
                 account on the new Version 2 clerk has sufficient access
                 to run the decnet_register utility. The Version 2 clerk
                 must also have permission to create and populate a
                 backtranslation directory (.DNA_BackTranslation) and
                 node synonym directory (.DNA_NodeSynonym) in the root
                 directory of the namespace during the next step of this
                 procedure.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If the node you configured as a Version 2 clerk in
                Step 1 is a new node, or is being assigned a new
                DECnet Phase IV-compatible address, you should update
                the DECnet node databases on all Version 1 servers in
                the namespace to include the new address before you
                proceed.

                ______________________________________________________

              3. Log in to the new Version 2 clerk node under the SYSTEM
                 account and invoke the sys$manager:decnet_register_
                 decdns.com utility. Do the following:

                 a. Choose Option 3 on the decnet_register_decdns.com
                    menu to create and populate a backtranslation
                    directory (.DNA_BackTranslation). Choose Option 2 to
                    create a node synonym directory (.DNA_NodeSynonym).

                 b. Choose Option 2 on the decnet_register menu to
                    register the new Version 2 clerk node (the node
                    you are logged in to) and to register all other
                    DECnet Phase IV nodes in the namespace including all
                    nodes that are currently functioning as DNS Version 1
                    servers.

              Refer to the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS Network Management
              guide for complete information on how to use the decnet_
              register utility and the decnet_register_decdns.com utility
              to perform these steps.

        7.5.2 Using the DNS Version 1 Namespace

              When you have completed this step, the DNS Version 1
              namespace is ready for use by other nodes running DECdns
              Version 2 on DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS software.

              Perform this procedure only once to prepare a DNS Version 1
              namespace for use with DECnet-Plus. After the node synonym
              and backtranslation directories are populated, you can
              configure new DECdns clerks, new DECdns servers (for VAX
              only) into an existing namespace, or convert existing
              DNS Version 1 servers to DECdns Version 2 format in the
              normal manner. Refer to the DECnet-Plus DECdns Management
              guide for information on how to convert a DNS Version 1
              clearinghouse to DECdns Version 2 format.

        7.6 Registering a Node in the Namespace

              The net$configure.com procedure creates an Export/Import
              file to register your node in the appropriate namespace.
              If your node is already registered, the decnet_register

        7.6.1 Export/Import File Format

              The decnet_register Export/Import file is a text file
              that has the following format where <synonym> is the node
              synonym name you selected during configuration:

              sys$manager:decnet_register_import_file_<synonym>.TXT

              If net$configure.com cannot access the DECdns namespace you
              have selected, it is most likely because:

                   This node could not be registered in one or more of the directory
                   services you have chosen.  When this procedure completes you or your
                   network manager will have to manually register this node in the directory
                   service(s) for which the error occurred.  See the DECnet-Plus Installation
                   and Configuration guide for more details, or contact your network manager.

                   Once the problem has been rectified, you or your namespace manager can
                   use the following decnet_register command(s) to register your node in the
                   appropriate directory service(s):

                      For the DECdns directory service:
                      DECNET_REGISTER IMPORT DIRECTORY DECDNS FILE -
                          DECNET_REGISTER_IMPORT_FILE_ELMER.TXT

                      For the LOCAL directory service:
                      DECNET_REGISTER IMPORT DIRECTORY LOCAL FILE -
                          DECNET_REGISTER_IMPORT_FILE_ELMER.TXT

                   Once the node has been successfully registered in the appropriate
                   directory service(s), invoke option 2 of NET$CONFIGURE.COM (Change
                   node name/namespace name) to complete the node's network configuration
                   and startup.

        Managing Name Services
        7.6 Registering a Node in the Namespace


              o  Your primary Local node full name does not have the
                 proper access necessary to look up or register your
                 secondary DECdns node full name.

                 If this is the case, you or your namespace manager need
                 to perform the following steps on the node that has the
                 DECdns server in order for your primary Local node to
                 obtain this access to the DECdns namespace:

                 1. Make sure the .WorldRead_Group is created on the
                    DECdns server node. If the .WorldRead_Group has not
                    been created yet, use the decnet_register manage
                    command to invoke decnet_register_decdns.com (located
                    in sys$manager:) to create the .WorldRead_Group. For
                    more details, refer to the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
                    Network Management guide.

                 2. Once you or your namespace manager knows that the
                    .WorldRead_Group has been created, invoke the
                    DNS$CONTROL utility on the node with the DECdns
                    server and enter the following commands:

                    $ mcr dns$control
                    DNS> add group <ns>:.worldread_group member local:.*...
                    DNS> add clear <ns>:.<ch_name> access <ns>:.worldread_group as group for r,t

                    where <ns> is the DECdns namespace name to which you
                    want your LOCAL node to have access and <ch_name> is
                    the clearinghouse name of the DECdns namespace you
                    are using.

              These commands will give your primary Local full name the
              proper access it needs to look up information regarding the
              secondary DECdns full name you have chosen.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you use DECDNS for the primary directory service
                and LOCAL for the secondary directory service, these
                steps are not necessary.

                             The POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility


              The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility replaces
              VMSINSTAL as the method of installing layered products
              for OpenVMS such as the OSI applications for DECnet-Plus
              for OpenVMS, and X.25 for OpenVMS Alpha. It allows you to
              install several software products with a single command.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Before installing DECnet-Plus using the POLYCENTER
                Software Installation utility for the first time
                on OpenVMS VAX Version 7.1, you should execute the
                following DCL command:

                $ product register product vms/version=v7.1/source=sys$update

                This needs to be done only once in the life of the
                OpenVMS system; it makes a permanent entry in the
                POLYCENTER Software Installation utility database, so
                it remains effective across system boots and for all
                future software upgrades.

                If you do not perform this operation before installing
                DECnet-Plus, the installation recommends termination
                due to the failure to locate the product "DEC VAXVMS
                VMS Version 7.1." Answer YES to the question Do you
                want to terminate? and perform the product register
                command as in the above example.

                ______________________________________________________

              Additional details for using the POLYCENTER Software
              Installation utility to install, manage, and remove
              software products on your system are provided in the
              OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference Manual.

        A.2 Creating and Using a Product Configuration File

              Some software products require you to make a set of choices
              when you install the product. For example, if you are
              installing a tool that checks spelling, you might choose
              which languages you want to include. When you use the
              POLYCENTER Software Installation utility, you can configure
              a product in one of three ways:

              o  By responding to questions asked during the installation
                 procedure

              o  By modifying your choices after you install a product

              o  By creating a product configuration file (PCF) before
                 you install the product

                             The POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility
                      A.2 Creating and Using a Product Configuration File


              By saving your answers in a PCF and using the file for
              subsequent installations, you can reduce or eliminate the
              questions asked when you install a product. You can also
              create multiple PCFs for each product. This allows you
              to customize software installations for unique hardware
              situations or for different usage patterns within a group.

              If you create a PCF as a separate operation, rather than
              as part of the installation procedure, you can determine
              how your choices are recorded in the PCF. You have the
              following options:

              o  Save your answer.

                 You can specify that your response to an installation
                 question (rather than the current default value) be
                 stored in the PCF.

              o  Use your answer only once.

                 You can answer a question without recording your
                 answer in the PCF. This is useful for responding to
                 questions that are specific to a single system (such as
                 a DECnet-Plus node name) or installation (such as a time
                 setting).

              o  Defer a question so that it is asked again during a
                 future installation.

                 For example, you might want an installer to verify that
                 a particular response is still valid for the systems on
                 which each installation is being performed.

              o  Prevent a question from being asked again.

                 If you do not defer a question when you create a PCF,
                 the default response recorded in the PCF is used during
                 future installations. The installer is not prompted for
                 the information. This reduces the length and complexity
                 of the actual installation procedure.

        The POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility
        A.2 Creating and Using a Product Configuration File


        A.2.1 Responding to Installation Questions

              The following are valid responses to questions asked during
              an installation:

              o  Enter your own value and press Return.

              o  Press Return to accept a default value.

              o  Press the defer key F17 or ~D to ask the same question
                 during future installations.

              o  Press F18 or ~W if you do not want to record the answer
                 as the default value in the PCF.

              o  Press the noexpand key F19 to accept default values for
                 a subset of options.

              To get help on using the POLYCENTER Software Installation
              utility script, at the DCL prompt type the following
              command:

              $ help product

        A.3 Verifying Pre-installation Tasks

              The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility verifies that
              any or all of the following are true, depending on your
              product:

              o  You are logged in to a privileged account.

                 It is good practice to install software from the system
                 manager's account with your default device and directory
                 set to SYS$UPDATE.

              o  Quotas, system parameters, disk space (and memory) are
                 adequate for installation.

                 The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility checks for
                 the quota values specified in Chapter 1. If it does not
                 find sufficient disk space, the installation procedure
                 provides the following options:

                 -  You can restart the installation and specify another
                    disk to use as an alternate working device for the
                    temporary working directory.

                             The POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility
                                     A.3 Verifying Pre-installation Tasks


                 -  You can terminate the installation and then create
                    more disk space on the system disk. The OpenVMS
                    VAX Upgrade and Installation Manual, and OpenVMS
                    Alpha Upgrade and Installation Manual describe how to
                    use tailoring utilities so you can delete files and
                    create more disk space.

                 If you lack sufficient free disk space for installation
                 or have no other disk to use as an alternate working
                 device, the installation procedure terminates.

              o  The minimum version of the OpenVMS operating system
                 supported by this release is installed.

              When the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility detects
              a problem in any of these areas, it asks if you want to
              continue the installation. If you want to continue, type
              YES. If you want to stop the installation, press Return.

        A.4 Resolving Conflicts

              The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility resolves some
              conflicts automatically. For other types of conflicts, the
              POLYCENTER Software Installation utility provides feedback
              on the nature of the conflict, letting you decide how you
              want to proceed.

              For example, if the wrong version of DECnet-Plus is
              installed, the Software Integrator prompts you to install
              the required version.

              Similarly, if the correct version of OpenVMS is installed
              and you elect not to use the default values when installing
              X.25, the Software Integrator warns you that you will need
              to use the RECONFIGURE option if you want to change the
              version of OpenVMS to be used.

        A.5 Determining Installation Progress

              As an installation procedure progresses, the system
              displays a percentage to indicate how much of the
              installation has been completed. For example:

              Percent Done: 0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...80%...90%...100%

              The following product has been installed:
              DEC AXPVMS DECNET_OSI V7.1

                         The POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility A-9

 



        The POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility
        A.5 Determining Installation Progress


              Or, as another example:

              Percent Done: 0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...80%...90%...100%

              The following product has been installed:
              DEC VAXVMS DECNET_OSI V7.1

              If you started the installation using the /LOG qualifier,
              the system displays details of the installation.

        A.6 Possible Installation Errors

              If the installation procedure fails for any reason, an
              error message appears. For example, if the installation of
              X.25 fails, the following message appears:

              %POLYCENTER Software Installation UtilityINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The
              ... installation of X.25 for OpenVMS Alpha Version 1.0 has failed.

              An error can occur during the installation if one or more
              of the following conditions exist:

              o  The operating system version is incorrect.

              o  The prerequisite software version is incorrect.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 inadequate.

              o  Process quotas required by the POLYCENTER Software
                 Installation utility are inadequate (see Chapter 1).

              o  The OpenVMS Help library is currently in use.

              If the installation fails, you must restart the
              installation procedure.

        A.7 Reporting Problems

              If you encounter a problem while using DECnet-Plus for
              OpenVMS or X.25 for OpenVMS Alpha, report it to Digital.
              Depending on the nature of the problem and the type
              of support you have, you can take one of the following
              actions:

              o  If your software contract or warranty agreement entitles
                 you to telephone support, call your Digital support
                 representative.

                    Installing DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS from an InfoServer


        B.1 Steps to Installing the Software from an InfoServer

              The following steps show you how to access the distribution
              kit via an InfoServer and install the software on your
              system.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The InfoServer does not use DECnet-Plus software to
                install software kits over the network.

                ______________________________________________________

              1. Verify that the network hardware is installed and
                 working properly.

              2. Log into the system manager account on your system.

              3. Set your system's SCSNODE SYSGEN parameter to a non-
                 blank value.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The InfoServer requires that the SCSNODE parameter
                be set to a non-blank value even if your system is
                running in a non-clustered environment.

                ______________________________________________________

              4. Check with the InfoServer manager to verify that the
                 DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS distribution kit is available.
                 If necessary, the InfoServer manager can refer to the
                 OpenVMS Layered Products Compact Disc User's Guide that
                 came with the compact disc distribution kit for specific
                 details about the disc that contains the distribution
                 kit.

        Installing DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS from an InfoServer
        B.1 Steps to Installing the Software from an InfoServer


              5. Get the distribution kit service name from the
                 InfoServer manager. For example, CDBIN is used in the
                 commands in this appendix as a kit service name.

              6. Enter the following command to start the InfoServer
                 client software on your system:

                 $ @sys$startup:ess$startup disk tape

              7. Assuming a service name of CDBIN, enter the following
                 command to bind the service containing the distribution
                 kit.

                 $ mcr ess$ladcp bind cdbin

              8. Assuming a service name of CDBIN, enter the following
                 command to mount the kit device (optional):

                 $ mount/override=identification dad$cdbin

        B.2 Install Commands

              To install DECnet-Plus from the CDBIN service, for example,
              you would enter:

              $ product install decnet_osi /source=dad$cdbin:[dnvosi071.kit]
