                                  Using the ADVANCED Configuration Option


              This chapter describes how to configure the DECnet-Plus for
              OpenVMS base components using the ADVANCED configuration
              option so that the system becomes a DECnet-Plus end system
              on a network. The ADVANCED configuration option allows you
              to customize your system's network configuration.

              If you have already configured the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
              software and you want to modify the configuration, see
              Chapter 3.

        1.1 Invoking the ADVANCED Configuration Option

              To invoke the net$configure.com procedure using the
              ADVANCED configuration option, enter the following command:

              $ @sys$manager:net$configure advanced

              The procedure starts:

                 DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS ADVANCED network configuration procedure

              This procedure will help you create or modify the management scripts
              needed to operate DECnet on this machine. You may receive help about
              most questions by answering with a question mark '?'.

              You have chosen the ADVANCED configuration option.  This option enables
              you to do some specific tailoring of your system's network configuration
              by answering some specific questions.  If you do not want to do specific
              tailoring of your system's network configuration but instead want to
              quickly configure your system using most of the default answers, you
              should invoke NET$CONFIGURE.COM with the BASIC configuration option, ie:
                             @SYS$MANAGER:NET$CONFIGURE BASIC

              * Do you want to continue?                             [YES] :

                           1.1 Invoking the ADVANCED Configuration Option


              The following illustrates the main menu options from which
              you can choose:

                      Configuration Options:

                      [0]     Exit this procedure

                      [1]     Perform an entire configuration
                      [2]     Change naming information
                      [3]     Configure Devices on this machine
                      [4]     Configure Transports
                      [5]     Configure Timezone Differential Factor
                      [6]     Configure Event Dispatcher
                      [7]     Configure Application database
                      [8]     Configure MOP Client database
                      [9]     Configure Cluster Alias
                      [10]    Replace MOP Client configuration
                      [11]    Configure satellite nodes
                      [12]    Configure cluster script locations

              * Which configuration option to perform?                 [1] : 1

              If you select Option 1, the procedure informs you that this
              is the first time you are configuring your system to use
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS:

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-SETUPNEW, setting up for new configuration

              If a Phase IV database exists on the system, the following
              message displays:

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-PHASEIVDATA, Phase IV DECnet database found

              You have the option of using the existing Phase IV database
              to generate the Network Control Language (NCL) scripts
              and configure the system. If you do not want to use the
              existing Phase IV database to generate the NCL scripts
              and configure the system, then net$configure configures
              the system based on your answers to the configuration
              questions.

              * Do you want to convert Phase IV databases?             [NO] : yes

              If you answer YES, the procedure prompts you for the Phase
              IV prefix (see Section 1.2.10 for more information):

              * Enter Phase IV Prefix                                [49::] :

        Using the ADVANCED Configuration Option
        1.1 Invoking the ADVANCED Configuration Option


              The net$configure procedure uses the system's existing
              Phase IV database to generate NCL scripts and configure the
              system.

              If you answer NO, the net$configure procedure does not
              use the system's existing Phase IV database to generate
              NCL scripts and proceeds to ask all the configuration
              questions. If you need more information to answer a
              question, you can type a question mark (?) at the prompts.
              To configure DECnet, you need to know your node's full name
              and network address or addresses.

        1.2 Directory Name Services

              DECnet-Plus provides access to the node name and addressing
              information stored in one or more name services. DECnet-
              Plus supports the following directory name services:

              o  Local namespace - A discrete, nondistributed namespace
                 that stores name and address information locally in
                 database files, the Local namespace replaces the DECdns
                 Local Naming Option (LNO). It also has the ability to
                 hold 100,000 nodes, and can scale beyond that number.
                 The actual number of nodes that the Local namespace can
                 hold depends on the space available on your system.
                 For more detailed information on namespaces, see
                 Section 2.1.

              o  DECdns distributed namespace - DIGITAL's Distributed
                 Name Service, DECdns is a distributed, global name
                 service. For more information, see Section 2.1.2.

              o  Domain Name System - The Domain Name System (DNS/BIND)
                 is supported for storage of IP addresses. For more
                 information see Section 2.1.3.

              If you choose to enter more than one directory name
              service for your system, enter them in order of priority.
              The ordering of this list is very important: the first
              directory service entered in this list is considered the
              primary directory service to use on the system. The primary
              directory service is considered the first choice to use
              when looking up naming information for the system.

                                  Using the ADVANCED Configuration Option
                                              1.2 Directory Name Services


              Enter an ordered list of the directory services you want
              to use on the system. If you enter more than one directory
              service, separate each service with a comma.

              * Enter the directory services to use on the system [LOCAL,DECDNS,DOMAIN] :

              For example, if you enter LOCAL,DECDNS,DOMAIN at the
              prompt, this means the following:

              o  You want to use the name services DECdns, Local, and
                 DNS/BIND.

              o  The primary name service is DECdns.

              o  The secondary name services are Local and DNS/BIND, in
                 that order.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If your node is also a DECdns server, the primary name
                service must be DECdns.

                ______________________________________________________

        1.2.1 Node Full Name

              Enter a node full name for each directory service chosen.
              The node full name is the name of your system's node
              object in the directory service. It includes the namespace
              nickname and the full list of directories leading to the
              node object name. Examples of node full names include:

               Local namespace -  LOCAL:.TomThumb
               DECdns          -  ACME:.wabbit.Elmer
               Domain          -  elmer.wabbit.acme.edu

              For the Local namespace, the namespace nickname LOCAL is
              prepended to the full name and is terminated with a colon
              (:). The namespace nickname LOCAL means that the Local
              namespace is used. The node object name must begin with
              a dot (.), and no element of the name (namespace name,
              directory, or node object name) can be a null string.
              Note that the namespace nickname LOCAL is reserved, and
              indicates that the Local namespace is used on this system.
              For example, if you enter "Local, DECdns, Domain" at the
              previous prompt, you will be asked for a DECdns full name,
              a Local full name, and a fully qualified host name for
              DNS/BIND.

        Using the ADVANCED Configuration Option
        1.2 Directory Name Services


              * Enter the full name for directory service LOCAL   : LOCAL:.ELMER

              * Enter the full name for directory service DECDNS  : ACME:.WABBIT.ELMER

              * Enter the fully qualified host name for DNS/BIND  : ELMER.WABBIT.ACME.EDU

        1.2.2 Node Synonym

              The node synonym is an alphanumeric character string
              between one and six characters long. The first character
              must be an alphabetic character; after the first character,
              the string can contain either alphabetic or numeric
              characters.

              If this system had previously been running DECnet Phase IV
              software, then you should use the old Phase IV node name as
              the synonym. If this system is joining a DECnet network for
              the first time, you can use any name for the synonym, as
              long as it meets the criteria listed above, and is unique
              within the network.

              * What is the synonym name for this node?            [ELMER] :

              For more information on node synonym directories, see
              Section 2.4.

        1.2.3 Naming Cache Timeout Value

              A naming cache is used to improve the performance of node
              name address resolution. This cache supersedes the existing
              DECdns cache and is used when looking for addresses in the
              Domain and Local services, in addition to DECdns. Note that
              other applications that directly use DECdns continue to use
              the DECdns cache.

              The naming cache includes a mechanism to "time out"
              old entries. In this way, these entries are refreshed
              periodically to accurately reflect the actual network
              environment.

              You have the option to set a value for the naming cache
              timeout interval. Enter any legal OpenVMS delta time value
              (the default is 30 days).

        1.2.4 Session Control Address Update Interval

              The session control address update interval is the
              time, in seconds, between updates of local tower address
              information.

              To choose a ten second interval, press Return. Otherwise,
              enter your own interval and press Return.

        1.2.5 Naming Cache Checkpoint Interval

              Periodically, DECnet-Plus saves a snapshot of the in-
              memory naming cache to disk. This allows systems, during
              startup, to have a naming cache that is already populated
              with entries, thereby preserving the contents of the naming
              cache across system reboots.

              * Naming cache checkpoint interval?               [08:00:00] :

              You have the option of setting the naming cache checkpoint
              interval. Enter any legal OpenVMS delta time value (the
              default is 8 hours).

        1.2.6 Specifying the Node Type

              Prior to DECnet-Plus Version 7.1, DECnet-Plus systems were
              end nodes. Dedicated routers on the network performed
              routing functions for the end nodes as necessary. With
              the Version 7.1 release, DECnet-Plus allows a system to
              run Integrated IS-IS, thus providing host-based routing
              functionality. The default is to be an end node.

              * What type of node (Endnode or Router)?           [ENDNODE] :

        1.2.7 Configuring Time Zone Differential Factors

              The UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is calculated
              automatically by using the OpenVMS UTC. The procedure
              displays the following message:

              Determining DTSS timezone rules from OpenVMS information...

              After the initial system configuration, you can choose to
              reconfigure the system's time zone rule (TZR) by selecting
              Option 5 in the top-level net$configure menu in either the
              BASIC or ADVANCED configuration procedure.

        1.2.8 Specifying Routing Information

              This section only applies if your DECnet-Plus system is a
              router.

              * Type of routing node (L1 or L2)?                      [L1] :

              Enter L1 if your DECnet-Plus system will provide intra-area
              level 1 routing capability. Enter L2 if your DECnet-Plus
              system will provide inter-area level 2 routing capability.
              The default is to be a level 1 router.

              * Maximum path splits                                    [2] :

              This specifies the maximum number of equal cost paths to
              split between.

              * PhaseIV Maximum Address                             [1023] :

              Specifies the maximum node number within a Phase IV area.

              * PhaseIV Maximum Area                                  [63] :

              This question only applies if your DECnet-Plus system is
              a level 2 router. It indicates the maximum Phase IV area
              number.

        1.2.9 Specifying a Phase IV-Compatible Address

              If you want your system to communicate with Phase IV
              nodes, you must specify a Phase IV address and a Phase
              IV prefix. These will be used to construct a DECnet Phase
              IV-compatible address.

              A DECnet Phase IV-compatible address is a DECnet-Plus
              address (NSAP) that conforms to the Phase IV area and node
              limits; that is, the area number is from 1 to 63, and the
              node number is from 1 to 1023.

              If there are no Phase IV systems on your network or you do
              not want to communicate with Phase IV systems, you do not
              need a Phase IV-compatible address. Entering a Phase IV
              address of 0.0 at configuration time indicates that this
              DECnet-Plus system will not have a Phase IV-compatible
              address, and will not communicate with Phase IV nodes.

              * Enter PhaseIV Address                              [15.27] :

              Enter the Phase IV address you want to use, or enter 0.0 if
              you do not want to communicate with Phase IV nodes.

        1.2.10 Specifying a Phase IV Prefix

              The default value for the Phase IV prefix is 49:: which
              represents the private network initial domain part (IDP).
              This is appropriate for a Phase IV DECnet network that
              contains some DECnet-Plus systems. All nodes within a
              single addressing domain contain the same IDP in their
              network addresses.

              If you are using a Phase IV prefix other than 49::, it
              must be assigned by an authorized standards organization,
              such as ANSI, or you must construct a Phase IV prefix that
              you know will be globally unique (based on your telephone
              number, for instance). If your organization has allocated
              its own Phase IV prefix, you can enter that value instead
              of 49::. The <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_PLANNING) contains a
              detailed description of how to construct an IDP and how
              to apply to a standards organization for an IDP.

        1.2.11 Specifying End Node Information

              This section applies only if your DECnet-Plus system is an
              end node.

        1.2.11.1 Configuring Network Addresses

              Your system must have at least one unique network address
              in order to use DECnet-Plus communications features.
              DECnet-Plus systems can be multihomed; that is, they can
              have more than one network address. You can assign up to
              three network addresses to your system.

              Having multiple addresses allows you to have both a DECnet-
              Plus extended address and a Phase IV-compatible address,
              so you can communicate with both Phase IV and DECnet-Plus
              systems on the same network. It also allows you to belong
              to more than one OSI network. This feature is particularly
              useful when you want to combine two (or more) networks.
              Rather than assign new addresses to all systems in both
              networks to reflect the new combined network, those systems
              that participate in both networks can have an address in
              each one.

              Network addresses are sometimes referred to in OSI
              terminology as network entity titles (NETs). NETs
              are network service access points (NSAPs) with a
              selector of 00. There are two ways to configure NETs:

              by autoconfiguring addresses or by manually configuring
              addresses.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you have an OSI router from a supplier other
                than Digital Equipment Corporation adjacent to your
                system, do not choose autoconfiguration unless you
                know that the router uses NETs with a selector of
                00. This restriction applies even if you have a
                Digital Equipment Corporation WANrouter as well as
                another supplier's OSI router on the same LAN. OSI
                routers that specify NETs differently can cause you to
                autoconfigure your network addresses incorrectly.
                If you have such a router, you must choose to
                manually configure your NETs by answering NO to the
                autoconfiguration question.

                ______________________________________________________

              Choice 1: Autoconfiguring Addresses

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                To use this option, you must be using only Phase V
                (OSI) addressing.

                ______________________________________________________

              If you want to have your network address autoconfigured for
              you, answer YES to the following question during network
              configuration when using the net$configure tool:

              * Autoconfigure network addresses?                     [YES] :

              Choice 2: Manually Configuring Addresses

              You can assign a maximum of three network addresses to the
              system including the Phase IV network address.

              To create a NET manually, you need to know your system's
              network IDP, network local area, and node ID.

              For example, given the following information:

                 A network IDP of 41:45436192:
                 A network local area of 43
                 A node ID of 258

              The NET is constructed as follows:

              IDP and selector    = 41:45436192:local-area:node-id:00
              43 decimal          = 2B    hexadecimal (local area)
              (43 * 1024) + 258   = 44290 decimal
              44290 decimal       = AD02  hexadecimal
              AD02 swapped        = 02AD  hexadecimal (node ID)

              The resulting NET is 41:45436192:00-2B:AA-00-04-00-02-AD:00

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                NETs can be entered in OSI format, DNA format, or
                hexadecimal format. Make sure you include the 00
                selector when you manually specify a NET.

                ______________________________________________________

              For more information on how to construct DNA and OSI
              NETs, see the chapter on NSAPs in the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_
              PLANNING).

        1.2.11.2 DNA Address Format

              You have the option of setting the value of the routing
              characteristic "DNA Address Format" to either TRUE or
              FALSE.

              * DNA Address Format                                  [TRUE] :

              The DIGITAL Network Architecture (DNA) Address Format
              attribute controls the interpretation of address
              structuring. It does not control autoconfiguration. To
              control autoconfiguration, you need to use the Manual
              Network Entity Titles attribute by manually adding or
              removing NETs.

        1.2.11.3 Segregated Mode Routing and Integrated Mode Routing

              You have the option of using integrated mode routing or
              segregated mode routing. If you answer NO to this question,
              you will default to integrated mode.

              * Do you want to use segregated mode routing?           [NO] :

              Integrated mode routing works in the following way: It
              sends DECnet Phase IV messages across the network using
              DECnet Phase V Network layer protocols. Routers receiving
              DECnet Phase IV packets translate them to OSI CLNP format
              before forwarding them. Messages destined for DECnet Phase

                             Using the ADVANCED Configuration Option 1-11

 



        Using the ADVANCED Configuration Option
        1.2 Directory Name Services


              IV systems are translated to Phase IV format only on the
              last hop of their journey. Integrated mode routing allows
              routers to route both DECnet Phase IV and Phase V traffic
              while storing a single network topology in their internal
              databases.

              Under integrated mode, DECnet-Plus systems attempt to
              send packets in DECnet Phase V format unless one of the
              following is true:

              o  They are communicating directly to an adjacent DECnet
                 Phase IV system.

              o  No DECnet Phase V routers exist on the network to
                 forward the packets.

              Integrated mode routing is the only mode supported on
              OpenVMS systems preceding DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS Version
              6.0.

              Segregated mode routing handles DECnet Phase IV and Phase V
              as independent protocols. Routers do not translate messages
              between DECnet Phase IV and Phase V formats. The routers
              must maintain separate network topologies in their internal
              databases to handle each type of protocol.

              Under segregated mode, DECnet-Plus end systems transmit
              messages in the Phase IV address format if they have a
              DECnet Phase IV translatable destination address. All other
              messages are sent in DECnet Phase V format. If you use non-
              DIGITAL routers that do not support DIGITAL's technique of
              translating DECnet Phase V addresses to DECnet Phase IV,
              you may want to use segregated mode routing.

              On OpenVMS systems, integrated mode is the default routing
              mode. Use integrated routing mode in an integrated routing
              environment where the routers can handle Phase-IV-to-Phase-
              V or Phase-V-to-Phase-IV packet format conversions. Use
              segregated routing mode when the adjacent router(s) cannot
              perform Phase-IV-to-Phase-V or Phase-V-to-Phase-IV packet
              conversions.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If your OpenVMS system is running cluster alias, you
                must use integrated mode.

              its hello. This interval multiplied by 3 is the amount of

              configures them. If the procedure finds that you have WANDD
              or X.25 installed but not configured, you will see the
              following information:

              You have installed wide area device support, but it has not been
              configured.  You may configure it now if you want.

              The following applies only if your DECnet-Plus is a routing
              node.

              For each data link and routing circuit pair entered,
              specify the circuit cost and router priority at level 1.
              If your node is also a level 2 router, you will be asked
              for level 2 cost and router priority.

              Cost indicates the cost of traffic on a particular circuit.

        1.3.3 Enabling Phase IV Addressing on Routing Circuits

              If you previously specified a Phase IV-compatible address
              in order to communicate with Phase IV nodes (as in
              Section 1.2.6), entering YES to the following question
              allows Phase IV messages to be transmitted on the circuit.
              Answering NO to this question means that no Phase IV
              messages will be transmitted on the circuit.

        1.3.4 FDDI Large Packet Support

              If you have an FDDI-type circuit on your system, you have
              the option of enabling FDDI large packet support. (A large
              packet is 4 KB in size, where an Ethernet packet is 1500
              bytes in size.) FDDI large packet support allows you to
              fully use the bandwidth of FDDI. (A DECnet-Plus router
              on the LAN, preferably on the FDDI, is required to enable
              large packet support.)

                                  Using the ADVANCED Configuration Option
                                                  1.3 Configuring Devices


              If you choose not to enable FDDI large packet support on
              the system, the FDDI circuit uses the bandwidth of Carrier
              Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA-CD)
              instead.

              If there is an FDDI-type circuit on the system, the
              procedure displays the following message:

              An FDDI-type circuit has been found on the system.  You have the
              option of enabling FDDI large packet support on the system.  Note
              that a DECnet-Plus router on the LAN (preferably on the FDDI) is
              required in order to use FDDI large packet support.

              * Enable FDDI large packet support?                     [NO] :

              If you want to enable FDDI large packet support, answer
              YES.

        1.3.5 Configuring an Alpha System

              1. For an Alpha system, the procedure displays the
                 following information:

                 DEC X.25 software has been installed on this system.  You have
                 the option of configuring DECnet to run over X.25.

                 * Do you want to configure DECnet over X.25?            [NO] :

                 Answer YES if you want to configure DECnet over X.25.

                 If you answer YES, you will see a list of choices for
                 the type of X.25 circuit to use:

                      Types of X.25 circuits:

                      [1] - X.25 Dynamic Assigned (DA)
                      [2] - X.25 Static Incoming (IN)
                      [3] - X.25 Static Outgoing (OUT)
                      [4] - X.25 Permanent (PVC)

                 * Which type of X.25 circuit do you want to use?             : 4

                 This prompt allows you to select the type of routing
                 circuit you want to use over X.25. The menu offers four
                 choices:

                 o  A dynamically assigned routing circuit (menu option
                    1) operates over a number of X.25 switched virtual
                    circuits (SVCs), both incoming and outgoing.

        Using the ADVANCED Configuration Option
        1.3 Configuring Devices


                 o  A static incoming routing circuit (menu option 2)
                    operates over a single incoming X.25 switched virtual
                    circuit (SVC).

                 o  A static outgoing routing circuit (menu option 3)
                    operates over a single outgoing X.25 switched virtual
                    circuit (SVC).

                 o  A permanent routing circuit (menu option 4) uses a
                    permanent virtual circuit (PVC) instead of an SVC.

                 Enter the number for the type of circuit you want.

              2. The procedure then asks for information about the
                 routing circuit.

                 * Routing Circuit Name to use?                   [X25-PVC-0] :

                 Specify the simple name you want to use for the routing
                 circuit. You can use the default or you can supply a
                 name (for example, X25-PSI-0).

              3. The procedure then asks for a template name to use for
                 the circuit you just specified.

                 * Template name?                                 [X25-PVC-0] :

                 Specify the simple name of an X25 Access template. A
                 default name is provided or you may enter your own name
                 (for example, X25-DA-1).

                 All X.25 routing circuits use an X25 Access template to
                 either make or accept a network connection.

                 o  For a static outgoing (OUT) circuit, the X25 Access
                    template must specify DTE class, destination DTE
                    address, and call data. The X25 Access template can
                    also specify other call characteristics to make the
                    outbound network connection.

                 o  For a static incoming (IN) routing circuit, the X25
                    Access template can specify call characteristics to
                    accept the inbound network connection.

                 o  For a dynamically assigned (DA) routing circuit, the
                    X25 Access template must specify DTE class and call
                    data. The X25 Access template can also specify other
                    call characteristics to make the outbound or accept
                    the inbound network connections.

                 Use the X.25 configuration program to configure X25
                 Access templates.

              4. If you chose to configure an X.25 dynamically assigned
                 (DA) circuit or an X.25 static incoming (IN) circuit,
                 the procedure asks for a filter name.

                 * Filter name?                                    [X25-DA-0] :

                 Specify the simple name of an X25 Access filter. You may
                 accept the default or you may enter your own name (for
                 example, X25-IN-0).

                 Static incoming and dynamically assigned X.25 circuits
                 use an X25 Access filter to receive inbound network
                 connections.

                 For a static incoming circuit, the X25 Access filter
                 must specify inbound DTE class, sending DTE address,
                 call data value, and call data mask.

                 For a dynamically assigned circuit, the X25 Access
                 filter must specify inbound DTE class, call data value,
                 and call data mask.

                 Use the X.25 configuration program to configure X25
                 Access filters.

              5. If you choose to configure an X.25 dynamic assigned (DA)
                 circuit, the procedure displays this prompt:

                 * Do you want to configure any reachable addresses?     [NO] :

                 If you answer NO, the procedure skips to the question,
                 "Configure another PSI routing circuit for DECnet?".

                 If you want to configure any reachable address
                 subentities, answer YES. The procedure displays the
                 following prompt:

                 * Reachable address name?                                    :

                 Specify the simple name of the reachable address
                 subentity that you want to create (for example,
                 ACCOUNTS_DEPT).

              6. The procedure then asks for the reachable address
                 prefix:

                 * Reachable address prefix                                   :

        Using the ADVANCED Configuration Option
        1.3 Configuring Devices


                 The reachable address subentity name is used to select
                 the remote DTE address to where a routing packet is
                 sent. The selection is done by finding a reachable
                 address subentity that has an address prefix matching
                 the beginning of the remote NSAP in the routing packet.

                 Specify the address prefix for this reachable address
                 entity. The address prefix is a string of characters
                 that is a valid beginning of an NSAP (for example,
                 41:45436192:). The address prefix matches all NSAPs.

              7. The procedure then prompts for the reachable address
                 data terminal equipment (DTE) list:

                 * Reachable address dte list?                                :

                 You can configure a reachable address subentity with one
                 or more DTE addresses. If more than one DTE address is
                 configured, then only one is selected each time a packet
                 is sent. All the remote DTE addresses must be accessible
                 by the DTE class configured in the X25 Access template
                 already configured for the associated dynamic assigned
                 circuit.

                 Specify the list of remote DTE addresses for this
                 reachable address entity. A DTE address consists of 1
                 to 15 decimal characters. The DTE addresses in the list
                 should be separated by commas (for example, 2,3,4).

              8. The procedure then prompts for additional reachable
                 addresses:

                 * Any more reachable addresses you wish to configure?   [NO] :

                 If you want to configure another reachable address
                 subentity for this circuit, answer YES.

              9. When you have entered the circuit, template, and filter
                 names and you have specified the appropriate reachable
                 address information, the procedure asks if you want to
                 configure any other circuits.

                 * Configure another PSI routing circuit for DECnet?     [NO] :

                 If you do not want to configure any other PSI routing
                 circuits, press Return for the default ([NO]). The
                 configuration procedure continues with the next series
                 of questions (such as FDDI large packet support or
                 transports, for example).

                 If you answer YES, the net$configure procedure invokes
                 the SYSMAN IO AUTO command to find devices on the
                 system. If you answer NO, there are no devices to
                 configure.

              system, the procedure displays the following information:

              * Do you want to configure Wide Area devices?          [YES] :

              Answer YES if you want to configure DECnet over P.S.I.

                       VAX Wan Device Drivers for DECnet/OSI for VMS
                       =============================================

                The Wide Area Network Datalinks and Drivers are  a  prerequisite
                for  DECnet/OSI.  They  also  provide  synchronous  datalinks in
                systems that do not use DECnet/OSI for networking.

                Access to DECnet/OSI datalinks (created by NCL) is  possible via
                the QIO interface to the WAN pseudo-driver, WANDRIVER.   Layered
                products  that use synchronous devices  do not  normally require
                programming  access to WANDRIVER.  For  further information, see
                the "DECnet/OSI for VMS WANDD Programming" guide.

              Do you wish to use WANDRIVER [N] ? y
              Will you use DEC HDLC [Y] ?
              Will you use LAPB/E (VAX P.S.I. requires LAPB/E) [Y] ?

                The DSV11 (Q-bus), DIV32 (Q-bus), DSB32 (BI-bus), DSF32 (MI-bus) and
                DSW devices are soft-loadable. The WANDD startup procedure will load
                the microcode for these devices if required.

              Do you have any soft-loadable microcode devices on this system [N] ?
              Will you use the VAXft DSF32 device driver [N] ? y

        1.3 Configuring Devices


                The  VAXft  DSF32  software  supports the  pairing  of  physical
                controllers to  provide  a fault-tolerant  configuration. Such a
                pairing  is  called  a  Failover Set. The  DSF32 device does not
                automatically create the failover sets, so you will need to pair
                controllers using the Failover Set Manager software.

                This  management  software can be  invoked during system startup
                from within the command procedure WANDD$STARTUP_SF.COM, which is
                placed  in  the SYS$STARTUP  directory  by the  kit installation
                procedure. If you want to have these Failover Sets automatically
                configured  when  the system  starts up  you will need to modify
                WANDD$STARTUP_SF.COM to include  Failover Set Manager commands
                that you require.

              Are you satisfied with the answers you have given [Y] ?

                If you have already started up the  WAN  Drivers  and  Datalinks
                (that    is,    if    you    have   already   successfully   run
                SYS$STARTUP:WANDD$STARTUP.COM  since  your   system   was   last
                booted),  then  you will need to reboot your system for your new
                configuration to take effect.

              possible responses you can enter.

              If no devices are found on the VAX system, the procedure

              nodes, answer YES to the following question.

              * Configure the NSP Transport?                         [YES] :

              If you answer NO, the procedure still loads the NSP
              Transport image. However, NSP Transport is not configured
              or usable until you run the net$configure procedure and
              answer YES to the question, "Configure the NSP Transport?"

              To determine the maximum number of active transport
              connections allowed at any one time to this transport,
              the procedure displays the following prompt:

              * Maximum number of logical links?                     [200] :

              You are then prompted to set the following values:

              * Maximum transmit and receive window?                 [20] :

              * Maximum receive buffers?                           [4000] :

              DIGITAL recommends setting a value of 20 for the maximum
              transmit and receive window option. The recommended value
              to set the maximum receive buffers is no more than maximum
              window multiplied by maximum transport connections for
              normal network operation in a typical network environment.

              Selecting other values than these can significantly alter
              the behavior of your system and network and should only be
              done after a thorough analysis of your network traffic and
              application requirements.

              High values of maximum receive buffers may require
              considerable buffering capacity on your node; therefore,
              a non-paged pool should be allocated accordingly. If your
              node does not have enough non-paged pool, maximum receive
              buffers should be set to a smaller value than maximum
              window multiplied by maximum transport connections.

              The transport receiver's window is determined by a
              combination of maximum transport connections, maximum
              receive buffers, and maximum window. During the life of
              the connection, the receiver quota fluctuates according to
              the value of maximum receive buffers divided by currently
              active connections. The credit window sent to the remote
              transmitter may or may not be this quota value, depending
              on the value of maximum window. If maximum window is set to
              less than the determined receiver quota, this value is used
              instead for the credit granted to the remote transmitter.

              The transmitter of a transport connection uses the credit
              sent by the remote receiver as its transmit window, unless
              its maximum window is a lower value. In that case, maximum
              window is used for the transmitter window.

        1.5 Configuring the OSI Transport

              If you want the system to communicate with DECnet-Plus
              nodes, OSI nodes of other vendors, or if you plan to
              install the OSAK, FTAM, or VT software, answer YES. If you
              want to use the DECnet over TCP/IP and/or OSI applications
              over TCP/IP, answer YES.

              * Configure the OSI Transport?                         [YES] :

              If you answer NO, the procedure still loads the OSI
              transport images. However, OSI transport is not configured
              or usable until you run the net$configure procedure and
              answer YES to the OSI transport question.

              To determine the maximum number of active transport
              connections allowed at any one time to this transport,
              the procedure displays the following prompt:

              * Maximum number of logical links?                     [200] :

              You are then prompted to set the following values:

              * Maximum transmit and receive window?                 [20] :

              * Maximum receive buffers?                           [4000] :

              DIGITAL recommends setting a value of 20 for the maximum
              transmit and receive window option. The recommended value
              to set the maximum receive buffers is no more than maximum
              window multiplied by maximum transport connections for
              normal network operation in a typical network environment.

              buffers should be set to a smaller value than maximum
              window multiplied by maximum transport connections.

              The transport receiver's window is determined by a
              combination of maximum transport connections, maximum
              receive buffers, and maximum window. During the life of
              the connection, the receiver quota fluctuates according
              to the value of maximum receive buffers divided currently
              active connections. The credit window sent to the remote
              transmitter may or may not be this quota value, depending
              on the value of maximum window. If maximum window is set to
              less than the determined receiver quota, this value is used

              its maximum window is a lower value. In that case, maximum
              window is used for the transmitter window.

              You are then prompted:

              * Run OSI Applications over TCP/IP?                    [YES] :

              Answer YES to this question if you want to run any of your
              OSI applications over TCP/IP. This causes the configuration
              utility to build the appropriate RFC 1006 template and
              establish a listener port for port 102.

              * Run DECnet over TCP/IP?                             [YES] :

              Answering YES to this question enables DECnet-Plus to
              run over a TCP/IP network to any system that has enabled
              this same feature. The configuration utility builds the
              appropriate RFC 1859 template and establishes a listener
              port for Port 399. (The default name for the RFC 1859
              template is osit$rfc1006plus.)

        1.5.1 Congestion Avoidance

              One feature of OSI transport is the ability to use the
              Congestion Experienced field in the Connectionless-mode
              Network Service (CLNS) routing header, and to implement a
              Congestion Avoidance scheme in heavily congested networks.
              The CLNS Congestion Experienced field is used by routers
              that support this feature (such as DECNIS) to give an early
              indication of congestion. When OSI transport receives data
              that passed through a network path where the Congestion
              Experienced bit is set, OSI transport reduces the transmit
              rate of the sending end system to help alleviate network
              congestion.

              This feature works well in networks where all protocols
              support Congestion Avoidance mechanisms. However, it
              has been noted that in some heavily congested multi-
              protocol networks, this feature can negatively impact the
              performance of DECnet compared to other protocols.

              DIGITAL recognizes that most of its customers have multi-
              protocol networks. In this environment, not all network
              protocols have Congestion Avoidance mechanisms. Therefore,
              the default of this characteristic is disabled.

              If you operate in an environment where you can take
              advantage of Congestion Avoidance mechanisms, DIGITAL
              recommends that you enable the feature again.

              You are asked a new question about multi-protocol networks:

              * Is this system operating in a multi-protocol network? [YES] :

              If you take the default answer of YES, then the OSI
              transport Congestion Avoidance characteristic is set to
              FALSE.

              A NO answer to this question sets the characteristic to
              TRUE.

              To change transport Congestion Avoidance values, you must
              invoke net$configure in ADVANCED mode and use Option 4
              (Configure Transports) and answer NO to the question.

        1.5.2 Setting Up the OSI Loopback Test Application Account

              If you answered YES to the "Configure the OSI Transport?"
              question described earlier, the procedure displays the
              following prompt:

              * Username for OSI loopback test application to use? [SYSTEST] :

              Press Return to accept the default user name for the
              application loopback test account. The procedure displays
              a message stating that the default OSI templates have been
              created.

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-CREDEFOSITEMPLATE, created default OSI templates

        1.5.3 Creating Additional OSI Templates

              If you configure OSI transport, net$configure automatically
              creates the default OSI templates required by the OSAK and
              FTAM installation and verification procedures (IVPs).

              * Do you want to create additional OSI templates?       [NO] :  yes

              If you answer YES to the previous prompt, the procedure
              displays prompts to obtain the information required to
              configure the OSI template; otherwise, the procedure skips
              to the Event Dispatcher question (see Section 1.6).

              * Type of network service (CLNS/CONS/RFC1006)?  [CLNS] :

              If you want to use Connectionless-mode Network Service
              (CLNS), press Return. If you want to use Connection
              Oriented Network Service (CONS), enter CONS. If you want
              to use DECnet over TCP/IP and/or OSI applications over
              TCP/IP enter RFC1006.

              For more information about types of network service, refer
              to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_NET_MGMT) guide or type a
              question mark (?) at the prompt.

              Depending on which network service you select, you will see
              one of the following prompts:

              * Name of the OSI template?               [OSIT$CLNS_Default0] :

              * Name of the OSI template?               [OSIT$CONS_Default0] :

              Enter the name you want to use for the OSI template (for
              example, OSI_TEMPLATE_1) or press Return to accept the
              default OSI template name.

              * Will this template be used for inbound packets?              :

              If you want this template to be used for inbound
              connections, enter YES. If you want this template to be
              used for outbound connections, enter NO.

              * Transport Classes to support?                       [4] :

              Enter the number of the transport protocol class you
              want to use for this template. DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
              supports three transport protocol classes: 0, 2, and
              4. If you select CONS as the network service type, the
              default is 0, 2, 4. If you select CLNS, the default
              is 4. If you select RFC 1006, the default is 0, 2. You
              can also configure multiple OSI templates. For more
              information about transport protocol classes, refer to the
              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_NET_MGMT) guide or type a question
              mark (?) at the prompt.

        1.5.3.1 CLNS Network Service

              If you select the network service CLNS, you will see the
              following prompt:

              * Use full CLNP or Null Internet?            [Full CLNP] :

              A CLNS OSI transport template can specify use of
              Internet/ES-IS routing protocols or Null Internet routing
              protocol. The Null Internet protocol only operates over LAN
              routing circuits.

              A CLNS OSI transport template for use with Internet/ES-IS
              routing protocols can use any routing circuits configured;
              the Routing module determines the most suitable circuit
              to use. A CLNS OSI transport template for use with Null
              Internet routing protocol can only use one routing circuit;
              routing circuit selection is based on its inactive area
              address.

              If you want to create additional OSI templates and you
              answer Null Internet to the "Use full CLNP or Null
              Internet?" prompt, the procedure displays the following
              prompt:

              * Which routing circuit is this Null Internet template for?  [CSMACD-0] :

              Enter the routing circuit you want to use for the CLNS
              OSI transport template (for use with Null Internet routing
              protocol).

              * Which CLNS Inactive Area to use?                   [49::FF-00] :

              A CLNS OSI transport template that specifies the Null
              Internet routing protocol selects the routing circuit based
              on the inactive area address of the routing circuit.

              If you plan to support Null Internet routing, you must
              configure an inactive area address for the circuit. The
              inactive area address for the circuit must be different
              than any area addresses used by DECnet-Plus routers on
              the same LAN. If you plan to configure more than one LAN
              routing circuit on this system, and you need Null Internet
              on each circuit, then each circuit should have a different
              inactive area address.

              The CLNS inactive area must be the same as the inactive
              area set in routing for Null Internet to be used.

        1.5.3.2 CONS Network Service

              If you selected CONS as the network service type, the
              procedure displays the following prompt:

              * CONS template name?                                        :

              Enter the CONS template name you want to use.

              The CONS template name must be the same as the name used
              for the X25 Access template for you to make any CONS
              connections.

              If the CONS template is used for inbound packets, you will
              see the following prompt:

              * CONS filter name?                                          :

              Enter the CONS filter name you want to use. The CONS filter
              name should be the same as the name being used for the X25
              Access filter. If it is not, you will not be able to make
              any CONS connections.

              * Allow use of expedited data?                         [YES] :

              If you want to support the use of expedited data, answer
              YES.

              * Allow use of Checksums?                              [YES] :

              If you want to use the error correction feature, answer
              YES.

        1.5.3.3 RFC 1006 Network Service

              If you select the network service RFC 1006, you will see
              the following prompt:

              * Local RFC1006 port number?                           [102] :

              Enter the outgoing port number to use when establishing a
              transport connection at the TCP level. For pure RFC 1006,
              use 102 as the port number. If you want to use DECnet over
              TCP/IP, use 399 as the port number.

              If the RFC 1006 template is used for inbound packets, you
              will see the following prompt:

              * RFC1006 listener port number?                        [102] :

              Enter the incoming port number to use when establishing a
              transport connection at the TCP level. This number must be
              the same as the local RFC 1006 port number for the template
              to be used for inbound traffic.

              * Do you want to create additional OSI templates?       [NO] :

              This prompt allows you to create additional customized OSI
              templates. If you answer YES to this prompt, the template
              questions are repeated. If you answer NO, the procedure
              proceeds to the Event Dispatcher question.

        1.6 Configuring an Event Dispatcher

              The Event Dispatcher is a utility to receive and display
              event messages. You can either take the default Event
              Dispatcher configuration, or you can choose to customize
              the Event Dispatcher configuration.

              * Do you want to customize the Event Dispatcher?      [NO] :

              Answer YES if you want to customize the Event Dispatcher
              configuration. Answer NO if you want the default Event
              Dispatcher configuration only.

              If you answer YES, the procedure displays prompts that
              allow you to customize the Event Dispatcher. The specific
              prompts are listed and explained in Section 3.8.

              If you answer NO, the procedure displays:

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-EVDDEFAULT, providing default Event Dispatcher configuration

              If you chose the default Event Dispatcher configuration,
              you have the option of displaying the events that are
              logged to the console of this machine. If you do not want
              to see the events logged to the console of this machine,
              net$configure will block the events for you.

              * Display the events logged to the console of this machine? [YES] :

        1.7 Configuring an Application Database

              The following questions determine if you want to set up
              and use a default account for application objects. You can
              create default accounts for the following applications:
              FAL, CML, MAIL, VPM, MIRROR, and PHONE.

              * Do you want to use a default account for the 'FAL' application? [NO] :

              File access listener (FAL) is an image that provides
              authorized access to the file system of a DECnet node on
              behalf of processes executing on any DECnet node in the
              network. FAL communicates with the initiating node by means
              of the Data Access Protocol (DAP). If you want an account
              set up or used for FAL, answer YES.

              * Do you want to use a default account for the 'CML' application? [YES] :

              CMIP Management Listener (CML) is the DECnet-Plus
              management module that implements the Common Management
              Information Protocol (CMIP). It is a utility that provides
              access to CMIP. If you want an account set up and used for
              CML, answer YES.

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-MAKEACCOUNT, this procedure creates user account CML$SERVER

              * Do you want to use a default account for the 'MAIL' application? [YES] :

              If you want to use the OpenVMS MAIL utility, answer YES.

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-MAKEACCOUNT, this procedure creates user account MAIL$SERVER

              * Do you want to use a default account for the 'VPM' application? [YES] :

              If you want the system to be an OpenVMS Cluster node,
              answer YES. The VMScluster Performance Monitor (VPM) needs
              an account on your system to support the OpenVMS Monitor
              utility command monitor cluster. Answer NO if the system is
              to be a non-cluster end system.

              If you answer YES, you will see the following message:

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-MAKEACCOUNT, this procedure creates user account VPM$SERVER

              * Do you want to use a default account for the 'MIRROR' application? [YES] :

              MIRROR is used for some forms of loopback testing. If you
              want to use MIRROR, answer YES.

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-MAKEACCOUNT, this procedure creates user account MIRRO$SERVER

              * Do you want to use a default account for the 'PHONE' application? [YES] :

              The PHONE utility allows users on the same or different
              OpenVMS systems to communicate interactively. If you intend
              to use the OpenVMS PHONE utility, answer YES.

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-MAKEACCOUNT, this procedure creates user account PHONE$SERVER

        1.8 Configuring a Cluster Alias

              The following steps describe how to configure a cluster
              alias.

              1. If the node is an OpenVMS Cluster member or if
                 net$configure finds an alias NCL script on the system,
                 the procedure prompts you to enter the full name of a
                 cluster alias.

                                         1.8 Configuring a Cluster Alias


                 * Full name of Cluster Alias                         : ACME:.WABBIT.HELP

                 If you do not want the node to participate in a cluster
                 alias, press Return.

                 If you want the node to participate in a cluster alias,
                 specify the full name that uniquely identifies the
                 cluster alias node (for example, ACME:.WABBIT.HELP).

              2. If you entered a cluster alias full name in response
                 to the previous prompt, the procedure displays the
                 following prompt:

                 * Cluster Alias Phase IV Address (aa.nnnn OR AA-00-04-00-xx-xx) : 12.139

                 Specify either the DECnet Phase IV node address or
                 Ethernet physical address of the alias.

                 The Phase IV node address has the format area-
                 number.node-number (for example, 12.139).

                 The Ethernet physical address has the format AA-00-
                 04-00-xx-xx, where xx-xx is calculated from the Phase
                 IV node address. To determine the Ethernet physical
                 address, proceed as follows:

                 a. Convert the Phase IV node address to its decimal
                    equivalent as follows:

                    (area-number * 1024) + node-number = decimal equivalent
                    (For example, (12 * 1024) + 139 = 12427 decimal)

                 b. Convert the decimal node address to its hexadecimal
                    equivalent and reverse the order of the bytes to form
                    the hexadecimal node address. For example:

                    (12427 decimal = 308B hex, reversed = 8B30 hexnodeaddress)

                 c. Incorporate the hexadecimal node address in the
                    following format:

                    AA-00-04-00-hexnodeaddress
                    (For example, AA-00-04-00-8B-30)

              3. If you entered a cluster alias full name and a Phase IV
                 address, the procedure displays the following prompt:

                 * Selection weight for this cluster node [0 for satellites]  :

        Using the ADVANCED Configuration Option
        1.8 Configuring a Cluster Alias


                 The selection weight determines the number of sequential
                 incoming connects passed to this alias member node in
                 the round-robin sequence before proceeding to the next
                 member node in the sequence. A value of zero means this
                 node is not eligible to receive incoming connections to
                 this alias address. Selection weight apportions incoming
                 alias connections according to the capacity of each
                 alias member. For example, nodes with greater capacity
                 should have larger values of selection weight, while
                 OpenVMS Cluster satellites should generally have a value
                 of zero. Specify a nonzero selection weight if this node
                 is connected locally to a dual-ported disk, or if it
                 will be serving any multihost disks, such as RFxx or
                 HSC-connected disks, to other cluster members. DIGITAL
                 recommends values between 0 and 10.

              If this is the first time you are configuring the DECnet-
              Plus for OpenVMS software on your system, the information
              in this chapter further explains some of the topics that
              appear as you run the configuration procedure.

        2.1 Names Services Overview

              While configuring DECnet-Plus, the system administrator
              specifies one or more of the following directory name
              services to use on the node: the Local namespace, DECdns,
              or Domain Name System (for DNS/BIND).

              o  Local namespace - A discrete, nondistributed namespace
                 that stores name and address information locally in
                 database files. DECnet-Plus includes a Local namespace.

              o  DECdns - DIGITAL's Distributed Name Service, a
                 distributed, global name service.

              o  Domain Name System - The Domain Name System (DNS/BIND)
                 supported for storage of IP addresses.

              For more information on name services, refer to the
              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_PLANNING).

        2.1.1 The Local Namespace

              DECnet-Plus includes a Local namespace, independent of
              DECdns, that is designed to scale to at least 100,000
              nodes.

              The Local namespace is a discrete, nondistributed namespace
              that exists on a single node and provides that node with
              a local database of name and address information. The
              prefix LOCAL: (or local:) is reserved to indicate that the
              information for the node is stored in the Local namespace.

                                               Managing Name Services 2-1

 



        Managing Name Services
        2.1 Names Services Overview


              DECnet-Plus recognizes that when a node full name begins
              with LOCAL:, information for that node is stored in a Local
              namespace.

              Unlike DECdns, the Local namespace does not employ
              backtranslation directories for address-to-node-name
              translation.

        2.1.1.1 Creating a Local Namespace

              If you want to create a Local namespace, enter
              LOCAL:.DirectoryPath.NodeObject at the following prompt:

              * Enter the full name for directory service LOCAL:

              The directory path identifies the namespace subdirectory
              (if any). The node object is the system's node name.
              The following are typical node full names properly
              formatted for the Local namespace: LOCAL:.xyz.abc and
              local:.maximum.

        2.1.1.2 Managing the Local Namespace

              The DECdns distributed namespace is not a requirement
              for DECnet-Plus, and the Local namespace does not depend
              on DECdns. However, the DECdns clerk software is still
              required on each node. You cannot use the DECdns Control
              Program (DNSCP) to manage information stored in the Local
              namespace. Instead, use decnet_register. The decnet_
              register tool is described in the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_
              NET_MGMT) guide.

        2.1.2 The DIGITAL Distributed Name Service (DECdns)

              DECdns is a networkwide service that makes it possible
              to use network resources without knowing their physical
              location. Users and applications can assign DECnet-Plus
              names to resources such as nodes. The creator of a name
              also supplies other relevant information for DECdns to
              store, such as the resource's network address. Users then
              need to remember only the name, and DECdns acts as a lookup
              service, providing the rest of the data when necessary.

        2.1.2.1 Creating a New Namespace

              You need to create a new DECdns namespace only if you are
              configuring the first DECdns server for the network or if
              you are creating an additional namespace. If you already
              have a DECdns namespace, you do not need to create a new
              namespace to be able to run DECnet-Plus. However, if this
              is the first system in a network where no namespace exists
              and you do not intend to use the Local namespace, you must
              create (and populate) a DECdns namespace.

              If you are unsure whether you need to create a new
              namespace or configure your system as a server, see your
              network manager. For information about namespace planning,
              refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_PLANNING).

              To create a new namespace while configuring a DECnet-Plus
              for OpenVMS system:

              o  The DECdns server software must be installed on the
                 system.

              o  DECdns must be specified as one of the naming services
                 configured on the system.

              When you create a namespace, you need a namespace nickname
              and clearinghouse name. The namespace nickname is part of
              the full name of every subsequent system in the network and
              should be unique to your network. The namespace nickname
              that you specify becomes the actual name of the namespace.
              A clearinghouse is a collection of directory replicas that
              contains the names and addresses of objects (for example,
              servers, clerks, files).

              DIGITAL recommends that you create namespace
              directories before using the configuration procedure
              (net$configure.com) to create the namespace. Follow these
              steps to create namespace directories:

              1. Invoke decnet_register and select option 10 ("Manage the
                 directory service").

              2. Follow directions. Be sure to specify DECdns as the
                 directory service to manage (the Local namespace is
                 the default). The decnet_register procedure invokes
                 sys$manager:decnet_register_decdns.com to create the
                 namespace directories.

        2.1 Names Services Overview


              3. When finished, invoke the configuration procedure to
                 create the new namespace.

              For more information on decnet_register, refer to
              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_NET_MGMT).

        2.1.2.2 Creating a DECdns Namespace

              If you select DECdns as a directory service, net$configure
              prompts you for the full name you want to use:

              * Enter the full name for directory service DECDNS:   new_ns:.mrv042 <Return>

              If this is a new DECdns namespace, net$configure prompts
              you for more information once the configuration procedure
              completes and you have started the network. The startup
              information will be similar to the following:

              %NET$STARTUP-I-OPERSTATUS, DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS operational status is RUNNING-
              MAJOR

              The namespace you specified was NEW_NS.

              %DNS-E-NOMATNS, The specified namespace is not being served on your LAN.
                      please choose from the following list

               [ 1]  BB_NS
               [ 2]  DOMAIN
               [ 3]  LOCAL
               [ 4]  X500

               [ 0]  - Reject this list -

                Pick a number from the list: 0  <Return>

              Because you are creating a new namespace, the namespace
              you specified at the prompt, "What is the full name of this
              node ?" does not appear in the list. To continue, enter 0
              and press Return to reject the list.

                     If you are installing DECnet-Plus for VMS for the first time
                     and you want to create a namespace, type Y.  If you want to
                     attempt a WAN connection to a remote DECdns server,
                     type N (default) at the following prompt:

              Do you want to proceed with creating a new namespace [n]: y  <Return>

              At this point, the configuration procedure needs to
              determine whether you intend to configure your system
              as a clerk on a WAN (connect to an off-LAN server), or
              create a new namespace. Since you cannot create a new
              namespace unless you have installed DECdns server software
              on the system, the procedure first verifies that the server
              software has been installed.

              If you want to create a new namespace, type YES at the
              prompt and press Return. The procedure continues prompting
              you for information necessary to create the namespace
              and the appropriate directories. The procedure displays
              information about the namespace, the directories, and other
              network parameters, then tells you when the configuration
              is complete.

                     Your next input will determine the name of the clearinghouse
                     in your namespace new_ns.  Enter the clearinghouse name as
                     alphanumeric and/or underscore characters.

              Enter a simple name for the clearinghouse: .mrv042_new_ns_ch  <Return>

              The DECdns namespace groups and directories will now be created.  This might
              take up to 6 minutes or more, depending on the speed of the DECdns
              server system and the amount of traffic on the network.

              Creating the NEW_NS:.DTSS_GlobalTimeServers directory.

              DECdns namespace initialization for DECnet use is complete.

              If this is the first time you have initialized the namespace for DECnet
              use, use SYS$SYSTEM:DECNET_REGISTER.EXE to:

                - Create a command file to automatically register previously defined
                  Phase IV nodes.  Execute this command file before you manually
                  register any other nodes using SYS$SYSTEM:DECNET_REGISTER.EXE.

                - Create any directories you need for node names that should be registered
                  immediately, according to your namespace design.  This includes the node
                  you are currently running on.

                - Be sure to add backtranslation directories for any non PhaseIV areas/IPDs.
                  Failure to do so will lead to Backtranslation Failures.  Once you've added
                  the necessary backtranslation directories, you may need to use the
                  ncl flush session control naming cache entry "*" command.

                - Change the local node's registered name from its default name to its
                  final full name.  The local node will be registered as a Phase IV node
                  with a default name when you execute the Phase IV node registration
                  command file above.

                - Change the currently registered names of other nodes from their default
                  names to their final full names when appropriate (for example, when they
                  are upgraded to run DECnet-Plus software).

              Continue to use SYS$SYSTEM:DECNET_REGISTER.EXE to:

                - Create any additional directories you need for node names, as new nodes
                  are brought up on the network.

                - Register new nodes as they are brought up on the network.

                - Add members to the NEW_NS:.DNA_Registrar access control group.

              Additionally, you can use the DECdns control utility to:

                -  Add specific access control to individual directories, objects, and
                   soft links.

        2.1.4 Namespace Management

              DECnet-Plus includes an in-memory naming cache to improve
              performance of name and address resolution for all
              supported name services. Refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_
              OVMS_NET_MGMT) guide for more information.

              DECnet-Plus includes several features to ease namespace
              management including decnet_register (a namespace
              management tool), several Network Control Language (NCL)
              commands, and Common Trace Facility (CTF) support for
              monitoring node name and address resolution.

              The decnet_register tool, an executable image located
              in SYS$SYSTEM:, centralizes and simplifies namespace
              management tasks by replacing functionality previously
              provided by both the decnet_dns_register and decnet_
              loc_register command procedures, which were located in
              SYS$MANAGER:. The decnet_register tool manages information
              in both the DECdns distributed name service and the Local
              namespace. The decnet_register manage command assists with
              setting up tasks for the DECdns Name Service. For example,
              it creates namespace directories and access groups, and
              enables autoregistration. Refer to the section on decnet_
              register in the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_NET_MGMT) guide for
              more information.

        2.2 Name Service Search Path

              The name service search path applies systemwide and
              allows DECnet-Plus to search a list of name services in
              a predetermined order when looking up names or addressing
              information. The search path includes naming templates
              that tell DECnet-Plus how to interpret any abbreviated node
              names entered by users.

              The ordering of the name services is very important. The
              first name service listed is the primary name service
              to use on the system. The primary name service is the
              first choice used when looking up names and addressing
              information. The remaining name services listed are the
              secondary name services used on the system.

              The search path contains a list of name service keywords,
              each followed by a naming template that specifies a
              "defaulting rule" so users can enter shorter node names.

                                             2.2 Name Service Search Path


        2.2.1 Configuring the Search Path Information

              During DECnet-Plus configuration, the system administrator
              uses net$configure.com to set up one, two, or three name
              services on each node.

              From the information provided by the system administrator,
              net$configure creates NET$SEARCHPATH_STARTUP.NCL, the
              standard search path NCL startup script which contains
              the name service search path information for the node.

              The system administrator supplies one or two properly
              formatted DECnet-Plus node full names (in the case of the
              Local namespace and the DECdns distributed name service)
              and one fully qualified host name for DNS/BIND (if DNS/BIND
              is to be used on the node).

              The first full name is specified in the proper format for
              the name service to be searched first. The second and third
              node names are properly formatted for the name services to
              be searched second and last.

              If more than one name service is to be used on the node,
              the name services are searched in the order specified
              by the system administrator. For example, if the system
              administrator specifies Local, DECdns and Domain for the
              name services to use on the system, the Local namespace is
              searched before the DECdns namespace and DNS/BIND.

              The following configuration example illustrates how to
              upgrade to DECnet-Plus Version 7.1 and use the new name
              service access features. Invoke net$configure.com and
              select Option 2 ("Change node name/namespace name"). The
              following prompt is displayed:

              * Enter the directory services to use on the system [LOCAL,DECDNS,DOMAIN]:

              At the prompt, you can choose the following name services
              for the system: LOCAL, DECDNS, and DOMAIN. If you enter
              more than one name service, separate each name with a
              comma.

              For example, entering DECDNS,LOCAL,DOMAIN at the prompt,
              means the following:

              o  You want to use the name services DECdns, Local, and
                 DNS/BIND.

              o  The primary name service is DECdns.

        2.2 Name Service Search Path


              o  The secondary name services are Local and DNS/BIND.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If your node is also a DECdns server, the primary name
                service must be DECdns.

                ______________________________________________________

        2.2.1.1 Naming Search Path in a Cluster

              All members in a cluster should have identical naming
              search paths configured. This will help to ensure that
              nodes are recognized in the various services you have
              identified.

              For example, if you receive mail on one node in the
              cluster, the "from" node name would be LOCAL:.NODE::SMITH.
              If you attempt to reply to this node from a node in the
              cluster that does not have Local configured, the system
              would indicate that there is no such node.

        2.2.2 Displaying the Search Path Information

              The system maintains two separate search paths:

              o  One search path supports forward translation or naming
                 (node-name-to-address translation).

                 $ mcr ncl show session control naming search path

              o  Another separate search path supports backtranslation
                 (address-to-node-name translation).

                 $ mcr ncl show session control backtranslation search path

        2.2.3 Modifying the Search Path Information

              DIGITAL recommends that you rerun net$configure.com to
              revise the standard search path NCL script (NET$SEARCHPATH_
              STARTUP.NCL) whenever it is necessary to reorder access
              to the name services on the node. To modify the standard
              search path startup script, run net$configure.com and use
              Option 2 ("Change node name/namespace name").

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Whenever you directly edit an existing NET$SEARCHPATH_
                STARTUP.NCL script, or when you use the NCL set
                command to change the script (rather than changing

                the script by rerunning net$configure.com), your
                edits are overwritten by any new NET$SEARCHPATH_
                STARTUP.NCL scripts you subsequently generate by
                rerunning net$configure.com.

                ______________________________________________________

        2.2.4 Creating a Site-Specific Search Path NCL Script

              DIGITAL recommends that you allow net$configure.com (and in
              some cases net$startup.com) to create and use the standard
              NCL search path script (NET$SEARCHPATH_STARTUP.NCL).

              However, if you need to make site-specific changes to your
              search path NCL script and do not want net$configure to
              overwrite these changes, you can create a site-specific
              search path NCL script by renaming the standard search
              path script (NET$SEARCHPATH_STARTUP.NCL) to NET$SEARCHPATH_
              LOCAL.NCL and making your changes to the new file.

              For example, you might want to use the NCL set command
              described in Section 2.2.6 to create site-specific naming
              templates in NET$SEARCHPATH_LOCAL.NCL.

              The net$configure.com and net$startup.com procedures check
              for the presence of a site-specific search path script
              (NET$SEARCHPATH_LOCAL.NCL) on the node. If NET$SEARCHPATH_
              LOCAL.NCL is present on the node, it is invoked instead of
              the standard script. A message similar to the following is
              displayed:

                 **************************************************************
                 A site-specific searchpath NCL script has been found on the
                 system (SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR]NET$SEARCHPATH_LOCAL.NCL;). The
                 configuration procedure will use this script to set the
                 searchpath instead of using the standard searchpath script
                 that is created by NET$CONFIGURE (NET$SEARCHPATH_STARTUP.NCL).

              The net$configure.com and net$startup.com procedures do
              not modify the site-specific search path NCL script;
              rather, they invoke the site-specific search path script
              as it currently exists. Therefore, when using a site-
              specific search path NCL script, you must modify it prior

              to invoking net$configure.com whenever you change any of
              the following name service information:

              o  The number of name services used on the node

              o  The order of the name services used on the node

              o  The specific name services used on the node

        2.2.5 Using the Search Path to Ease Migration

              A search path can be used to simplify migration from one
              name service to another. The system administrator can
              create a search path designating the currently used name
              service as the primary name service (to be searched first)
              and the new name service as the secondary name service
              (to be searched second after the primary name service is
              searched).

              As the secondary name service becomes populated with node
              and addressing information, the system administrator can
              rerun net$configure.com and select Option 2 to reverse the
              positions of the name services in the search path. This
              causes the current secondary service to become primary, to
              be searched first for node and addressing information.

        2.2.6 Setting Up Naming Templates

              In each template, the user-supplied portion of the name
              (usually the node's terminating name or rightmost simple
              name) is indicated with an asterisk (*). For example, if
              the DECdns template is: "ABCDE:.xyz.*" and a user supplies
              the name fin, then the full name ABCDE:.xyz.fin is looked
              up in DECdns namespace ABCDE.

              You should specify only one asterisk per template. Only
              the first occurrence of an asterisk (*) in the template is
              substituted with the user-supplied name. Any additional
              asterisks are passed to the name service as part of
              the full name. When you specify a template without an
              asterisk, the template string is passed to the name service
              unchanged.

              If the user-supplied name should be passed to the name
              service as entered by the user, the template should be
              specified as follows: "*".

                                             2.2 Name Service Search Path


              DECnet-Plus provides an NCL set command for modifying
              the naming templates associated with the naming and
              backtranslation search paths. Do not use the NCL set
              command to modify aspects of the search path other than the
              naming templates. The following NET$SEARCHPATH_LOCAL.NCL
              script creates typical naming and backtranslation search
              paths. In this script ABCDE represents the DECdns namespace
              nickname. Your namespace nickname will appear in your NCL
              script:

              SET NODE 0 SESSION CONTROL NAMING SEARCH PATH -
                      ([DIRECTORY SERVICE = LOCAL, TEMPLATE = "*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = LOCAL, TEMPLATE = "local:*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = LOCAL, TEMPLATE = "LOCAL:.*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DECDNS, TEMPLATE = "*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DECDNS, TEMPLATE = "ABCDE:*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DECDNS, TEMPLATE = "ABCDE:.xyz.*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DECDNS_SYNONYM, TEMPLATE = "ABCDE:.DNA_NodeSynonym.*"
                      ], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DOMAIN, TEMPLATE = "*"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DOMAIN, TEMPLATE = "*.xyz.ABCDE.com"])
                      SET NODE 0 SESSION CONTROL BACK SEARCH PATH -
                      ([DIRECTORY SERVICE = LOCAL, TEMPLATE = ""], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DECDNS, TEMPLATE = "ABCDE:.DNA_BackTranslation"], -
                      [DIRECTORY SERVICE = DOMAIN, TEMPLATE = ""])

        2.3 Domain Synonyms

              Support for the Domain Name System (DNS/BIND) provides
              for the use of node synonyms. This allows for backward
              compatibility with older applications that cannot use long
              domain names.

              There are two ways to configure node synonyms for use with
              DNS/BIND:

              o  By constructing an appropriate set of naming search path
                 templates

              o  By defining local aliases

        Managing Name Services
        2.3 Domain Synonyms


        2.3.1 Search Path Naming Template Support for Domain Synonyms

              You can provide synonym support for entire domains by
              constructing an appropriate set of search path templates.
              Note that excessively long search paths (search paths with
              many entries) can increase the time it takes to look up
              node addresses. See Section 2.2 for general information on
              name service search paths.

              Entering the following NCL command sets up a search path
              for a system using DNS/BIND:

               $ mcr ncl set session control naming search path =                 -
                   { [Directory Service = Domain, Template = "*"],                -
                     [Directory Service = Domain, Template = "*.finbar.com"],     -
                     [Directory Service = Domain, Template = "*.abc.finbar.com"], -
                     [Directory Service = Domain, Template = "*.xyz.finbar.com"]}

              This NCL command results in the following DNS/BIND naming
              templates:

                *
                *.finbar.com
                *.abc.finbar.com
                *.xyz.finbar.com

              When DECnet-Plus receives a connection from node
              koi.abc.finbar.com, it determines that koi is a usable
              synonym for this node, and DECnet-Plus will return the name
              koi to applications that require Phase IV style node names.

              Using search path naming templates for synonym support
              allows the user to enter any of the following node names:
              koi, koi.abc, or koi.abc.finbar.com for node koi.

        2.3.2 Local Aliases

              Another way to define a node synonym for a particular
              node is by adding DNS/BIND alias names to the local host's
              database. The following is an example using DIGITAL TCP/IP
              Services for OpenVMS:

              $ ucx set host koi.abc.finbar.com/address=aa.bb.cc.dd/alias=koi

              DECnet-Plus will now return the node synonym koi to
              applications that require Phase IV-style node names.

        2.4 Node Synonym Directories

              The default node synonym directory is .DNA_NodeSynonym.
              If you plan to use a node synonym directory other than
              this default directory, you must define the logical
              name DECNET_MIGRATE_DIR_SYNONYM to the synonym directory
              name you want to use in sys$manager:net$logicals.com.
              (If you do not have a sys$manager:net$logicals.com
              procedure on your system, you can create one using
              sys$manager:net$logicals.template.) This makes the
              definition permanent (that is, it will not be deleted when
              you reboot the system).

        2.4.1 Defining an Alternate Node Synonym Directory

              Use the following format to define an alternate node
              synonym directory:

              $ define decnet_migrate_dir_synonym "alt-directory-name"

              If you use a synonym directory name that includes special
              characters or three or more dots, the system might produce
              an error. To avoid this, enclose the synonym directory name
              in quotes. For example:

              $ define/system decnet_migrate_dir_synonym ".ch.noun.synonym"

              The net$configure procedure needs this logical name to be
              defined at all times if you wish to use a synonym directory
              other than .DNA_NodeSynonym. Be sure to add this definition
              to net$logicals.com to ensure that the definition of the
              synonym directory will be permanent.

        2.4.2 When to Use the Logical Name

              You can use the logical name as described in Section 2.4.1
              for either the BASIC or the ADVANCED configuration option.

              You must define this logical name before you use any of
              following procedures:

                 net$configure.com
                 decnet_register.exe
                 decnet_migrate.exe

        2.4 Node Synonym Directories


              If synonym lookup fails in the namespace, the software does
              one of the following:

              o  The startup procedure defines SYS$NODE, SYS$CLUSTER_
                 NODE, or both to be the first six characters of the last
                 simple name of the respective node full name or cluster
                 full name.

              o  The configuration procedure defines SYS$NODE to be the
                 node synonym name that was entered during configuration.

              The system displays a message that it has redefined the
              logical names.

        2.5 Using a DNS Version 1 Namespace with DECdns Version 2

              If you are already using a namespace created with Version
              1 of the VAX Distributed Name Service (DNS) (running on
              DECnet Phase IV), you can continue to use the namespace
              when you upgrade your networking software to DECnet-Plus
              for OpenVMS. However, because of differences in the way
              that DNS Version 1 and DECdns Version 2 handle access
              control, you must prepare your DNS Version 1 namespace
              for use by DECnet-Plus. DNS Version 1 and DECdns Version
              2 interpret principal specifications in access control
              entries (ACEs) differently.

              In DNS Version 1, servers recognize principals only
              in the form nodename::username. In DECdns Version 2,
              servers recognize principals primarily in the form
              nodename.username. For DECdns Version 2 clerks and servers
              to interpret and process existing DNS Version 1-style
              access control entries in the namespace, you need to create
              a backtranslation directory (.DNA_BackTranslation) and
              a node synonym directory (.DNA_NodeSynonym) in the root
              directory of the namespace. You must then populate these
              directories by registering all the nodes participating in
              the Version 1 namespace.

                2.5 Using a DNS Version 1 Namespace with DECdns Version 2


        2.5.1 Preparing a DNS Version 1 Namespace for Use by DECdns
              Version 2

              To prepare a namespace created with DNS Version 1 for use
              by DECnet-Plus, follow these steps:

              1. Install and configure DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS on any
                 node in your namespace that is not currently functioning
                 as a DNS Version 1 server. Configure the node as a
                 DECdns Version 2 clerk. Refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_
                 OVMS_INSTALL_BASIC) guide if you plan to use the BASIC
                 configuration option. If you plan to use the ADVANCED
                 configuration option, see Section 1.1.

              2. From any node running DNS Version 1 server software,
                 use the DNS Version 1 control program (DNS$CONTROL) add
                 access command to grant the following DNS Version 1-
                 style access on behalf of the SYSTEM account on the new
                 Version 2 clerk node that you configured in Step 1:

                 o  Read, write, delete, test, and control access to the
                    root directory of the namespace

                 o  Read, write, delete, test, and control access to the
                    clearinghouse that stores the master replica of the
                    root directory

                 For example, if the DECnet-Plus full name of the new
                 clerk is .pastry, and the master replica of the Version
                 1 namespace is stored in the .paris_ch clearinghouse,
                 enter the following two commands:

                 DNS> add access pastry::system directory . /rights=(r,w,d,t,c)

                 DNS> add access pastry::system clearinghouse .paris_ch /rights=(r,w,d,t,c)

                 You need to grant this access to ensure that the SYSTEM
                 account on the new Version 2 clerk has sufficient access
                 to run the decnet_register utility. The Version 2 clerk
                 must also have permission to create and populate a
                 backtranslation directory (.DNA_BackTranslation) and
                 node synonym directory (.DNA_NodeSynonym) in the root
                 directory of the namespace during the next step of this
                 procedure.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If the node you configured as a Version 2 clerk in
                Step 1 is a new node, or is being assigned a new

                DECnet Phase IV-compatible address, you should update
                the DECnet node databases on all Version 1 servers in
                the namespace to include the new address before you
                proceed.

                ______________________________________________________

              3. Log in to the new Version 2 clerk node under the SYSTEM
                 account and invoke the sys$manager:decnet_register_
                 decdns.com utility. Do the following:

                 a. Choose Option 3 on the decnet_register_decdns.com
                    menu to create and populate a backtranslation
                    directory (.DNA_BackTranslation). Choose Option 2 to
                    create a node synonym directory (.DNA_NodeSynonym).

                 b. Choose Option 2 on the decnet_register menu to
                    register the new Version 2 clerk node (the node
                    you are logged in to) and to register all other
                    DECnet Phase IV nodes in the namespace including all
                    nodes that are currently functioning as DNS Version 1
                    servers.

              Refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_NET_MGMT) guide for
              complete information on how to use the decnet_register
              utility and the decnet_register_decdns.com utility to
              perform these steps.

        2.5.2 Using the DNS Version 1 Namespace

              When you have completed this step, the DNS Version 1
              namespace is ready for use by other nodes running DECdns
              Version 2 on DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS software.

              Perform this procedure only once to prepare a DNS Version 1
              namespace for use with DECnet-Plus. After the node synonym
              and backtranslation directories are populated, you can
              configure new DECdns clerks, new DECdns servers (for VAX
              only) into an existing namespace (see Section 3.4.5),
              or convert existing DNS Version 1 servers to DECdns
              Version 2 format in the normal manner. Refer to the
              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_DNS_MGMT) guide for information on how
              to convert a DNS Version 1 clearinghouse to DECdns Version
              2 format.

        2.6 Registering a Node in the Namespace

              The net$configure.com procedure creates an Export/Import
              file to register your node in the appropriate namespace.
              If your node is already registered, the decnet_register
              Export/Import file is not created.

        2.6.1 Export/Import File Format

              The decnet_register Export/Import file is a text file
              that has the following format where <synonym> is the node
              synonym name you selected during configuration:

              sys$manager:decnet_register_import_file_<synonym>.TXT

        2.6.2 Problems Registering a Node

              If you encounter problems registering your node in the
              Local namespace or in the DECdns namespace, you will see
              information similar to the following:

              .
              .
              .
              Updating nodes listed in SYS$MANAGER:DECNET_REGISTER_IMPORT_FILE_ELMER.TXT

              Error - Node registration was unsuccessful
                      Please correct any problems and re-register the node
                  LOCAL:.elmer

                The specified node name is already in use as a synonym
                      Used by node: LOCAL:.WABBIT.ELMER
                      Synonym:      elmer

              You can choose to stop processing this command, continue executing this
              command until completion or until the next error, or ignore further errors
              and continue to completion.

        2.6 Registering a Node in the Namespace


                   This node could not be registered in one or more of the directory
                   services you have chosen.  When this procedure completes you or your
                   network manager will have to manually register this node in the directory
                   service(s) for which the error occurred.  See the DECnet-Plus Installation
                   and Configuration guide for more details, or contact your network manager.

                   Once the problem has been rectified, you or your namespace manager can
                   use the following DECNET_REGISTER command(s) to register your node in the
                   appropriate directory service(s):

                      For the LOCAL directory service:

                              SYS$MANAGER:DECNET_REGISTER_IMPORT_FILE_ELMER.TXT

                   Once the node has been successfully registered in the appropriate
                   directory service(s), invoke option 2 of NET$CONFIGURE.COM (Change
                   node name/namespace name) to complete the node's network configuration
                   and startup.

                   **********************************************************************

              If net$configure.com cannot access the DECdns namespace you
              have selected, it is most likely because:

              o  The namespace is not available at the moment.

              o  Your node does not have proper access to the DECdns
                 namespace.

              o  The namespace you are using is new and the directories
                 have not been created yet.

              When this happens, you will see the following message
              (this example uses ACME: as the namespace that is not
              accessible):

                   NET$CONFIGURE.COM cannot access the ACME: namespace, either because
                   the namespace is not available at the moment, your node does
                   not have proper access to the namespace, or because the namespace
                   you are using is new and the directories have not been created yet.
                   Therefore, the DECNET_REGISTER tool cannot attempt to look up or register
                   your node into the ACME: namespace.

                   When the problem is rectified, please use the DECNET_REGISTER import file

        2.6 Registering a Node in the Namespace


                 If this is the case, you or your network manager need
                 to perform the following steps on the node that has the
                 DECdns server in order for your primary Local node to
                 obtain this access to the DECdns namespace:

                 1. Make sure the .WorldRead_Group is created on the
                    DECdns server node. If the .WorldRead_Group has not
                    been created yet, use the decnet_register manage
                    command to invoke decnet_register_decdns.com (located
                    in sys$manager:) to create the .WorldRead_Group. For
                    more details, refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_
                    NET_MGMT) guide.

                 2. Once you or your namespace manager knows that the
                    .WorldRead_Group has been created, invoke the
                    dns$control utility on the node with the DECdns
                    server and enter the following commands:

                    $ mcr dns$control
                    DNS>add group <ns>:.worldread_group member local:.*...
                    DNS>add clear <ns>:.<ch_name> access <ns>:.worldread_group as group for r,t

                    where ns is the DECdns namespace name to which you
                    want your LOCAL node to have access and ch_name is
                    the clearinghouse name of the DECdns namespace you
                    are using.

              These commands will give your primary Local full name the
              proper access it needs to look up information regarding the
              secondary DECdns full name you have chosen.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you use DECDNS for the primary directory service
                and LOCAL for the secondary directory service, these
                steps are not necessary.

                                        Modifying a Current Configuration


              This chapter describes the steps necessary to modify a
              current configuration.

        3.1 Steps for Changing the Configuration

              If your system has already been configured, you can modify
              it with the net$configure basic configuration option (the
              default) or with the net$configure advanced configuration
              option.

              Table 3-1 provides some guidelines for making your
              configuration choice.

              If you prefer to use the BASIC configuration option,

                  You are upgrading or reconfiguring DECnet-Plus.

                  You need to access a DECdns server for network
                  addresses.

                  You want to run DECnet over TCP/IP (RFC 1859) and/or
                  OSI applications over TCP/IP (RFC 1006).

                  You only have one communications device, or you
                  have multiple devices, all of which will be used for
                  DECnet-Plus communications.

                  You want to use the default names for all devices and
                  routing circuits.

                  You want to autoconfigure your network addresses only.

                  You want to configure both the NSP and OSI transports
                  and only want to create default OSI templates. You want
                  to enable both DECnet over TCP/IP or OSI applications
                  over TCP/IP.

                  You do not want to enable FDDI large packet support (if
                  you have an FDDI-type circuit).

                  You want to set the routing characteristic DNA
                  address format to TRUE (this attribute controls the
                  interpretation of address structuring).

                  You want to use integrated mode routing.

        3.2 Steps for Changing a Current Configuration

              Changing your DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS configuration with
              the ADVANCED option involves the following steps:

              1. Run net$configure procedure using the ADVANCED
                 configuration option with the following command:

                 $ @sys$manager:net$configure advanced

                 The procedure starts:

                    DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS ADVANCED network configuration procedure

                 This procedure will help you create or modify the management scripts
                 needed to operate DECnet on this machine. You may receive help about
                 most questions by answering with a question mark '?'.

                 You have chosen the ADVANCED configuration option.  This option enables
                 you to do some specific tailoring of your system's network configuration
                 by answering some specific questions.  If you do not want to do specific
                 tailoring of your system's network  configuration but instead  want  to
                 quickly  configure your  system using most  of the default answers, you
                 should invoke net$configure.com with the BASIC configuration option, ie:
                             @SYS$MANAGER:NET$CONFIGURE BASIC

                 * Do you want to continue?                             [YES] :

              2. Answer YES if you want to continue. You will now see the
                 date that the checksum file was last modified:

                    Checksum file updated last by SYSTEM on 18-SEP-1995 16:04:24.19

                If this is the first time you are invoking the
                net$configure procedure, or if you have deleted the
                checksum file, the following menu is not displayed.
                Instead, the prompts shown in Section 6.1 of the

                  * Which configuration option to perform?            [1] :

              3. Choose the option you want. Selecting an option allows
                 you to modify either the entire configuration or a
                 particular portion.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                To select Options 10 or 11, you must have already
                configured the system using the ADVANCED configuration
                option, and net$configure is executing on a cluster
                system. See Section 3.14 and Section 3.15 for more
                information.

                ______________________________________________________

              4. After you have completed the configuration dialog, the
                 system displays the following question:

                 * Do you want to generate NCL configuration scripts [YES] :

                 If you answer YES, the configuration program uses the
                 information you entered to generate modified NCL scripts
                 and, in some cases, automatically modify the system's
                 configuration. The configuration program then returns
                 to the Configuration Options menu. If you answer NO,
                 the configuration procedure returns to the Configuration
                 Options menu and does not generate any modified NCL
                 scripts.

        Modifying a Current Configuration
        3.2 Steps for Changing a Current Configuration


              You can use the net$configure procedure to modify the
              current configuration. Depending upon which menu option
              you select, net$configure either modifies the configuration
              automatically or produces modified NCL scripts which you
              can use to modify the system's configuration.

              You can execute modified NCL scripts in two ways:

              o  Rebooting the system

              o  Disabling the entity to which the script applies and
                 executing the modified script

              To execute the NCL script, use the format ncl> do script-
              file. For example:

              ncl> do sys$manager:net$nsp_transport_startup.ncl

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The net$configure procedure does not automatically
                execute the modified NCL scripts for you. However,
                it will execute the search path NCL script
                (NET$SEARCHPATH_STARTUP.NCL).

                ______________________________________________________

              To customize your system beyond what the net$configure
              procedure provides, you must edit the NCL scripts produced
              by net$configure.com (refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_
              OVMS_NET_MGMT) guide). DIGITAL recommends that you use the
              net$configure procedure for major modifications involving
              an entire entity.

        3.3 Changing an Entire Configuration

              To make changes to the entire configuration, proceed as
              follows:

              * Which configuration option to perform?             [1] :

              Select Option 1.

              The system displays the same prompts that were displayed
              for the initial configuration. The prompts show the current
              configuration values as the default. If you do not want to
              change the current values, accept the default value. Refer
              to Section 1.1 for an explanation of the prompts shown
              for a net$configure ADVANCED configuration. Refer to the

                                     3.3 Changing an Entire Configuration


              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_INSTALL_BASIC) guide, Chapter 6,
              for an explanation of the prompts shown for a net$configure
              BASIC configuration.

              At the end of the procedure, you see the following prompt:

              * Do you want to generate NCL configuration scripts? [YES] :

              If you answer YES, the configuration program uses the
              information you entered to generate modified NCL scripts.
              If you answer NO, the configuration procedure does not
              generate NCL scripts.

              If you generate NCL scripts, the procedure displays another
              prompt:

              * Do you want to start the network?               [YES] :

              Answer YES to start the network and to complete the network
              configuration. To implement the NCL scripts, reboot the
              system.

        3.4 Changing the Node Name/Namespace Name

              To change the directory name services used on the system,
              the system's full names or the fully qualified host name,
              the namespace that the system uses, or the system's node
              synonym, proceed as follows:

              * Which configuration option to perform?            [1] :2

              Select Option 2 and press Return.

              If you are using either the BASIC or ADVANCED configuration
              option, you will see the following prompt:

              * Enter the directory services to use for the system   [LOCAL,DECDNS,DOMAIN]:

        3.4.1 Changing Directory Name Services

              Enter the directory name services you want to use. (The
              first service you enter is considered your primary name
              service; the default is the name service you entered for
              the previous configuration.)

              Depending on the directory services you choose, you may see
              one or more of the following prompts:

        Modifying a Current Configuration
        3.4 Changing the Node Name/Namespace Name


              * Enter the full name for directory service LOCAL:
              * Enter the full name for directory service DECDNS:
              * Enter the fully qualified host name for DNS/BIND:

        3.4.2 Changing Node Name or Namespace

              To change the node name or the namespace that it uses,
              enter the node's new full name. The format is:

              NamespaceNickname:.DirectoryPath.NodeObject

              For DECdns, the namespace nickname is the name that a
              DECdns manager assigns to a namespace when installing and
              configuring DECdns server software. If the namespace has a
              nickname, you must enter the nickname as part of the node's
              full name. However, not all namespaces have nicknames.
              Namespaces are required to have nicknames only if there is
              more than one namespace on the network.

              If you use the Local namespace, the namespace nickname is
              LOCAL:.

        3.4.3 Changing Node Synonym

              Next you will be prompted for the node synonym:

              * What is the synonym name for this node?           [YEWHO1] :

              The synonym name is a Phase IV-compatible node name. It can
              be one to six alphanumeric characters long, must not start
              with a number, and must be unique within the namespace.
              It is required for Phase IV nodes using the namespace and
              DECnet-Plus nodes that need to communicate with Phase IV
              nodes.

              The following display shows the system response to a node
              name change.

              Answer YES to connect to a remote server via a WAN. The
              procedure then prompts you for the remote server's Phase
              IV-compatible address (if it has one) or its network
              service access point (NSAP). The NSAP is the network entity
              title (NET) with a valid transport selector. To find this
              information, contact the server's system administrator. The
              server system probably has a number of different NSAPs. You
              can use any of these NSAPs to connect to the server system,
              but you must enter the NSAP in the format in which it is
              displayed.

              After you enter the server's address (for example, 4.456),
              your system connects to the server.

              You then receive a confirmation message listing your
              namespace nickname and its namespace creation timestamp
              (NSCTS), as in the following:

                If you are joining a Distributed Name Service (DNS)
                Version 1.1 namespace, make sure you have access to
                the remote server's sys$library:dns$ns_def_file.dat
                file.

                Invoke the procedure sys$manager:dns$configure.com
                and use Option 2 on the DECdns configuration menu
                to connect to a remote DNS Version 1 server. Make
                sure the SYSTEM account on your DECdns Version 2
                clerk has DECnet_FAL access or proxy access to the
                sys$library:dns$ns_def_file.dat file on the remote
                Version 1 server. These accounts need this access to
                successfully copy the Version 1 server information
                contained in the sys$library:dns$ns_def_file.dat file.

                under a privileged account other than SYSTEM, the
                account still requires the appropriate access.

                ______________________________________________________

              If you cannot connect to the remote server, the procedure
              displays the following message:

        3.4.5 Configuring a DECdns Server System in an Existing Namespace

              To configure additional DECdns servers into an existing
              namespace, you must use the DECdns configuration program,
              sys$system:dns$configure.exe. Be sure to refer to the
              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_DNS_MGMT) guide for DECdns access
              control information and for complete information about
              using the DECdns configuration program to configure a
              DECdns server into an existing namespace.

        3.4.5.1 Configuring a DECdns Server in a DNS Version 1 Namespace

              If you are already using a DNS Version 1 namespace (a
              namespace created with Version 1 of the Distributed Name
              Service), you can configure one or more DECdns Version 2
              servers into that namespace. Before you try to configure
              a DECdns server into a DNS Version 1 namespace, make sure
              that the namespace has been prepared for use by DECnet-
              Plus (see Section 2.5). For complete information on how to
              prepare a DNS Version 1 namespace for use by DECnet-Plus,
              refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_DNS_MGMT) guide for DECdns
              access control information.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The DECdns configuration program allows you to convert
                your DNS Version 1 clearinghouses to DECdns Version 2
                format. By doing so, you get the improved performance
                offered by the DECdns Version 2 server while using
                your existing DNS Version 1 namespace. If you intend
                to convert your DNS Version 1 clearinghouses to DECdns
                Version 2 format, DIGITAL strongly recommends that
                you do not configure DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS on any
                of your DNS Version 1 server nodes until you have
                prepared your DNS Version 1 namespace for use by
                DECnet-Plus.

        3.5 Reconfiguring Devices

              To reconfigure the devices, proceed as follows from the
              Configuration Options menu:

              * Which configuration option to perform?            [1] :3

              Select Option 3 and press Return.

              Before proceeding with this menu option, the procedure
              determines whether the system has network devices that are
              supported by net$configure.

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-SCANCONFIG  scanning device configuration - please wait

              If no supported network devices are found or new devices
              are found that were not detected the last time you ran
              the net$configure procedure on this system, the procedure
              displays the following prompt for Alpha systems:

              * Should a SYSMAN IO AUTO be executed?                       :

              For VAX systems, you will see the following prompt:

              * Should a SYSGEN AUTOCONFIGURE ALL be executed?       :

              If you answer YES, the net$configure procedure invokes
              the SYSMAN IO AUTO or the SYSGEN AUTOCONFIGURE ALL command
              to find devices. If you answer NO, then there will be no
              devices to configure and the procedure exits.

              The BASIC configuration automatically configures your
              devices and asks no further questions concerning device
              configuration. If you choose the ADVANCED configuration,
              the procedure prompts you for data link names and routing
              circuit names to use for each device.

              * Data Link name to use for ESA0 (DESVA)            [CSMACD-0] :

              Specify the simple name you want to use for the data link
              device or accept the system-supplied default. If you do not
              want this device configured for DECnet-Plus, enter NONE.

              * Routing Circuit Name for Data Link 'CSMACD-0'     [CSMACD-0] :

              Specify the simple name you want to use for the routing
              circuit or accept the system-supplied default. DIGITAL
              recommends that you use the default name even if you
              configure multiple lines of the same type.

              * Level 1 Cost for Routing Circuit 'CSMACD-0'?           [8] :
              * Level 1 Router Priority for Routing Circuit 'CSMACD-0'? [64] :

              If your DECnet-Plus system is a router, then you will
              be asked for this information for the routing levels
              supported.

              Cost indicates the cost of traffic on a particular circuit.
              Priority refers to the priority for becoming a designated
              router on a LAN at level 1 or level 2.

              * Enable Phase-IV Addressing on Routing Circuit 'CSMACD-0'? [YES] :

              If you previously specified a Phase IV-compatible address
              in order to communicate with Phase IV nodes (as in
              Section 1.2.6), entering YES to the question above allows
              Phase IV messages to be transmitted on the circuit.
              Answering NO to this question means that no Phase IV
              messages will be transmitted on the circuit.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Phase-IV addressing can be enabled on only one routing
                circuit. If you are using large packet support with
                FDDI, you must ensure that Phase-IV addressing is
                enabled on an FDDI routing circuit.

              Option 4 from the Configuration Options menu and press
              Return.

              * Which configuration option to perform?             [1] : 4

              The BASIC configuration automatically configures the
              NSP and OSI transports. If you choose the ADVANCED
              configuration option, the procedure asks if you want to
              configure the NSP and OSI transports.

              The following sections describe the prompts that are
              required to reconfigure the transports.

              * Configure the NSP Transport?                         [YES] :
              *   Maximum number of logical links ?                  [200] :
              *   Maximum Transmit and Receive Window ?               [20] :
              *   Maximum Receive Buffers  ?                        [4000] :
              * Configure the OSI Transport?                         [YES] :
              *   Maximum number of logical links ?                  [200] :
              *   Maximum Transmit and Receive Window ?               [20] :
              *   Maximum Receive Buffers  ?                        [4000] :
              *   Run OSI Applications over TCP/IP ?                 [YES] :
              *   Run DECnet over TCP/IP ?                           [YES] :
              * Is this system operating in a multi-protocol network? [YES] :
              * Do you want to replace the existing NSP transport script? [NO] :
              * Are the point-to-point lines utilizing line speeds less than 9600 BPS? [NO]
              * Do you want to replace the existing OSI transport script? [NO] :

              * Configure the NSP Transport?                         [YES] :

              If you want to communicate with any DECnet Phase IV nodes,
              answer YES.

              To determine the maximum number of active NSP transport
              connections allowed at any one time to this transport, the
              procedure displays the following prompt:

              * Maximum number of logical links?                     [200] :

              You are then prompted to set the following values:

              * Maximum transmit and receive window?                  [20] :

              * Maximum receive buffers?                            [4000] :

              DIGITAL recommends setting a value of 20 for the maximum
              transmit and receive window option. The recommended value
              to set the maximum receive buffers is no more than maximum
              window multiplied by maximum transport connection for
              normal network operation in a typical network environment.

              Selecting other values than these can significantly alter
              the behavior of your system and network and should only be
              done after a thorough analysis of your network traffic and
              application requirements.

        3.6 Reconfiguring the NSP and OSI transports


              High values of maximum receive buffers may require
              considerable buffering capacity on your node; therefore,
              a non-paged pool should be allocated accordingly. If your
              node does not have enough non-paged pool, maximum receive
              buffers should be set to a smaller value than maximum
              window multiplied by maximum transport connections.

              The transport receiver's window is determined by a
              combination of maximum transport connections, maximum
              receive buffers, and maximum window. During the life of
              the connection, the receiver quota fluctuates according to
              the value of maximum receive buffers divided by currently
              active connections. The credit window sent to the remote
              transmitter may or may not be this quota value, depending
              on the value of maximum window. If maximum window is set to
              less than the determined receiver quota, this value is used
              instead for the credit granted to the remote transmitter.

              The transmitter of a transport connection uses the credit
              sent by the remote receiver as its transmit window, unless
              its maximum window is a lower value. In that case, maximum
              window is used for the transmitter window.

              * Configure the OSI Transport?                         [YES] :

              If you want the system to communicate with DECnet-Plus
              nodes or if you plan to install the OSAK, FTAM, or VT
              software, answer YES. If you want to use the DECnet over
              TCP/IP and/or OSI applications over TCP/IP, answer YES.

              If you answer NO, the procedure still loads the OSI
              transport images. However, OSI transport is not configured
              or usable until you run the net$configure procedure and
              answer YES to the OSI transport question.

              To determine the maximum number of active OSI transport
              connections allowed at any one time to this transport, the
              procedure displays the following prompt:

              * Maximum number of logical links?                     [200] :

              You are then prompted to set the following values:

              * Maximum transmit and receive window?                 [20] :

              * Maximum receive buffers?                           [4000] :

              a non-paged pool should be allocated accordingly. If your
              node does not have enough non-paged pool, maximum receive
              buffers should be set to a smaller value than maximum
              window multiplied by maximum transport connections.

              The transport receiver's window is determined by a
              combination of maximum transport connections, maximum
              receive buffers, and maximum window. During the life of
              the connection, the receiver quota fluctuates according to
              the value of maximum receive buffers divided by currently
              active connections. The credit window sent to the remote
              transmitter may or may not be this quota value, depending
              on the value of maximum window. If maximum window is set to
              less than the determined receiver quota, this value is used
              instead for the credit granted to the remote transmitter.

              The transmitter of a transport connection uses the credit
              sent by the remote receiver as its transmit window, unless
              its maximum window is a lower value. In that case, maximum
              window is used for the transmitter window.

              You are then prompted:

              * Run OSI Applications over TCP/IP?                    [YES] :

              Answer YES to this question if you want to run any of your
              OSI applications over TCP/IP. This causes the configuration
              utility to build the appropriate RFC 1006 template and
              establish a listener port for port 102.

        3.6 Reconfiguring the NSP and OSI transports


              Answering YES to this question enables DECnet-Plus to run
              over a TCP/IP network to any system that has enabled this
              same feature. The configuration utility builds appropriate
              RFC 1859 template and establishes a listener port for port
              399.

              You are then prompted about multi-protocol networks:

              * Is this system operating in a multi-protocol network?  [YES] :

              If you take the default answer of YES, then the OSI
              transport and NSP Congestion Avoidance characteristic are
              set to FALSE. Note that currently NSP does not support the
              Congestion Avoidance attribute.

              A NO answer to this question sets the characteristic to
              TRUE.

              If an NCL script already exists for an NSP transport
              and you answer YES to the "Configure the NSP Transport?"
              prompt, the procedure displays the following prompt:

              * Do you want to replace the existing NSP transport script? [NO] :

              If you reconfigure the NSP transport, you have the option
              of accepting the existing transport script or replacing
              it with a new one. Answer YES if you want to replace the
              existing NSP transport script.

              * Are the point-to-point lines utilizing line speeds less than 9600 BPS? [NO]

              You will be prompted only if you have any point-to-point
              lines (i.e., any synchronous and/or asynchronous lines)
              configured. If you have any point-to-point lines running at
              low line speeds (lower than 9600 bits/s), answer YES. This
              places additional NSP NCL commands into the NSP transport
              NCL script to accommodate the lower line speeds. If you
              do not have any point-to-point lines being utilized at low
              line speeds, answer NO.

              * Do you want to replace the existing OSI transport script? [NO] :

              Answer YES if you want to replace the existing OSI
              transport script.

              If you answer YES to the "Configure OSI Transport?" prompt
              and you want to replace the existing OSI transport NCL
              script, the procedure displays the following prompt
              (ADVANCED configuration option only):

              scripts. The configuration program then returns to the
              Configuration Options menu. To implement the modified
              NCL scripts, reboot the system or disable the transport
              entities and execute the scripts.

              If you answer NO, the configuration procedure returns to
              the Configuration Options menu and does not generate NCL
              scripts.

        3.7 Reconfiguring the Time Zone Differential Factor (DECdts)

              DECdts binary time values are based on Coordinated
              Universal Time (UTC), an international time standard
              that has largely replaced Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) as
              a reference. For most measurement purposes, UTC is the
              equivalent of GMT. However, time zones are still determined
              by their relationship to the prime meridian in Greenwich,
              England. The local time in each time zone or locale is
              determined by its offset, or differential, from the
              Greenwich time zone. This value is commonly expressed as
              a time differential factor (TDF) of a positive or negative
              number of hours.

        3.7.1 Selecting the DECdts Configuration Option

              To reconfigure DECdts, proceed as follows from the
              Configuration Options menu:

              * Which configuration option to perform?            [1] :5

        3.7.2 Configuring Your System's Local Time

              When you are initially configuring a system, you must
              determine its geographical location and designate its time
              zone rule (TZR), which is based on the location. The TZR
              contains the abbreviated name of the system's time zone and
              the applicable TDF, so that DECdts can calculate UTC from
              the system (local) time during the initial configuration of
              the DECdts software. The TZR also contains information on
              any seasonal adjustments to the TDF that normally apply in
              the selected time zone.

              If you want to select the commonly accepted TZR for a
              given area and system, you can use the net$configure
              procedure menus to select the geographical location of
              the system. Based on your selection, the net$configure
              procedure automatically sets the TZR. After you configure
              your system, it displays the local time even though the
              DECdts software uses UTC in the background. Because the

              default value of the DECdts management attribute Automatic
              TDF Change is TRUE, DECdts also changes the displayed local
              time automatically if there is a seasonal adjustment to the
              system's TDF.

              In rare instances, you may want to customize the TZR for
              your system, thereby modifying its TDF from the one that
              normally applies in a given time zone or location. The
              net$configure menus also provide a selection for entering
              a custom TZR for your system, although you must know the
              TZR syntax to enter it. See Section 3.7.2.3 for further
              information on customizing the system's TZR.

              After the initial system configuration, you can reconfigure
              the system's time zone rule (TZR) by selecting Option
              5 in the top-level net$configure menu. For example,
              this may be necessary because you moved the system to
              a different location. To reconfigure the TZR, you must
              know the system's geographical location, or in some cases,
              the time zone. If you do not know the system's time zone
              and the configuration procedure requires you to enter it
              for your locale, refer to the world time zone map in the
              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_DTS_MGMT) guide. Additionally, when you
              reconfigure the DECdts software, you are given the option
              of setting the system's time to UTC time or customizing the
              system's time to any time zone.

        3.7.2.1 Configuring Your System's Local Time Using Menus (Menu
                Option 1)

              Option 1 of the Timezone Options menu allows you to choose
              the geographical region and conventional TZR for the
              system. DECdts uses the TZR to automatically convert UTC
              to the local time whenever the time is displayed. To use
              Option 1, proceed as follows:

              * Enter an option number                           [1] :

              Press Return to select Option 1.

              This completes changes to DECdts configuration using Option
              1.

        3.7.2.2 Configuring Your System's Local Time as UTC (Menu Option
                2)

              If your system is located in the GMT time zone or
              Antarctica, and you do not want to make seasonal
              adjustments to the TDF, you may want to use UTC as your
              system's local time. You can also configure all network
              systems with UTC if you consider local time irrelevant for
              your applications. If you select UTC as the local time and
              later enter the NCL command show dtss current time, the
              local time displayed has a TDF of 0 (zero).

              The following example shows how to select UTC for the
              system's local time.

                       Timezone Options:

                      [0]     Exit Timezone Configuration

                      [1]     Choose a timezone using menus
                      [2]     Use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)
                      [3]     Type in your own timezone rule

              * Enter an option number                            [1] :2

        3.7.2.3 Customizing Your System's Time Zone Rule (Menu Option 3)

              The net$configure procedure allows you to create a
              customized time zone rule (TZR) for your system, rather
              than selecting a location and having the procedure
              configure a TZR for you. When you create a customized TZR,
              you must supply the correct abbreviation for the system's
              time zone, the zone's offset from GMT, and optional
              seasonal time-change information. If you do not know the
              system's time zone or time zone abbreviation, see Table 3-2
              in this book, and the world time zone map in the appendix
              of the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_DTS_MGMT) guide.

              The following example shows the TZR syntax and describes
              the TZR fields; you can also display similar information by
              typing a question mark (?) after you choose Option 3 from
              the Timezone Options menu.

                       Timezone Options:

                      [0]     Exit Timezone Configuration

                      [1]     Choose a timezone using menus
                      [2]     Use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)
                      [3]     Type in your own timezone rule

              * Enter an option number                                 [1] :3

              STDoffset[DSToffset,start[/time],end[/time]]

              STD         Specify three or more characters that are
              DST         the designation for the standard (STD) or
                          summer/daylight-saving time (DST) time zone.
                          The variable STD is required; if DST is
                          missing, then summer time does not apply in
                          this locale. Uppercase and lowercase letters
                          are explicitly allowed. Any characters except a
                          numeral, comma (,), minus (-), plus (+), space,
                          and ASCII NUL are allowed.

              offset      Specifies the value to be added to the local
                          time to arrive at UTC. The offset has the
                          format hh[:mm[:ss]]; the hour (hh) is required
                          and can be a single digit. The minutes (mm) and
                          seconds (ss) are optional. One or more digits
                          can be used; the value is always interpreted as
                          a decimal number. The hour must be between zero
                          and 24; the minutes and seconds (if present)
                          between zero and 59. If preceded by a minus
                          (-), the time zone is east of Greenwich; if
                          preceded by a (+) or not signed, it is west of
                          Greenwich. Note that the signing conventions
                          are based on POSIX rules, which reverse ISO
                          signing conventions.

              start       Indicate when to change to and from summer
              end         time. The variable start describes the date of
                          the change to summer time, and end describes
                          the date of the change back to standard time.
                          The start and end format follows:

                             Jn - The Julian day n (1 < n < 365). Leap
                             days are not counted. That is, in all years
                             (including leap years) February 28 is day 59
                             and March 1 is day 60. It is impossible to
                             explicitly refer to the occasional February
                             29.
                             n - The zero-based Julian day (0 < n < 365).
                             Leap days are counted, and it is possible to
                             refer to February 29.
                             Mm.n.d - The nth d day of month m (1 < n <
                             5, 0 < d < 6, 1 < m < 12). When n is 5 it
                             refers to the last d day of month m. Day 0
                             is Sunday.
                             time - The time field describes the time
                             when, in current time, the change to or
                             from summer time occurs. The variable time
                             has the same format as offset except that
                             no leading sign (- or +) is allowed. The
                             default, if time is not given, is 02:00:00.

              As an example of a typical TZR, if the rule has the value
              EST5EDT4,M4.1.0,M10.5.0, it describes the rule for the
              eastern United States, which became effective in 1987.
              EST is the designation for Eastern Standard Time, which
              is 5 hours behind GMT. EDT is the designation for Eastern
              Daylight-Saving Time, which is 4 hours behind GMT. EDT
              starts on the first Sunday in April and ends on the last
              Sunday in October. In both cases, because the time is not
              specified, the change to and from EDT occurs at the default
              time of 2:00 a.m.

              Since the TZR format is complex, you may want to refer to
              Table 3-2 to copy the rule for your locale onto the command
              line, and then edit the rule as desired.

        3.8 Reconfiguring the Event Dispatcher

              1. To reconfigure the Event Dispatcher, proceed as follows
                 from the Configuration Options menu:

                 * Which configuration option to perform?             [0] : 6

              2. Select Option 6 and press Return.

                 %NETCONFIGURE-I-EVDFND, Event dispatcher NCL script already exists
                 * Replace Event Dispatcher NCL script file?         [NO] :

                 If you want to create a new Event Dispatcher NCL script
                 file, answer YES. If you want to keep the previously
                 generated Event Dispatcher NCL script file, answer NO.

                 The BASIC configuration option automatically creates a
                 default Event Dispatcher configuration for you. You then
                 see the display summary.

              3. With the ADVANCED configuration, you have the option to
                 customize your Event Dispatcher configuration.

                 * Do you want to customize the Event Dispatcher?    [NO] :

                 If you answer NO, the procedure uses the default
                 configuration. You see the following message:

                 %NET$CONFIGURE-I-EVDDEFAULT, providing default Event Dispatcher configuration

                 You then see the following prompt (for the ADVANCED
                 configuration):

                 * Display events logged to the console of this machine?   :

              4. If you answer YES to the "Customize the Event
                 Dispatcher?" question, the procedure displays:

                 * Configure a Sink?                                [YES] :

                 If you want to customize information pertinent to the
                 sink, answer YES (for example, if you want to change
                 where to send the output: a terminal, a printer, or a
                 file). If you answer YES, the procedure displays the
                 following prompt:

                 * Sink name?                                [local_sink] :

                 Specify the name of the sink you want to use for the
                 local node (for example, local_sink).

                 * Maximum buffer size?                                   :

                 Specify the maximum number of octets that the sink
                 allows to process events (for example, 16384).

                 * Object name?                                           :

                 Specify the DECdns full name of the object for which
                 the sink accepts incoming connections. Unless the
                 value of this characteristic is null, the sink employs
                 the Session Control layer's Keep me Here function to
                 maintain the object name in the namespace.

                 * End user specification?                                :

                 Specify the DIGITAL Network Architecture (DNA) Session
                 Control local address for which the sink accepts
                 incoming connections (for example, number=82).

                 * Catch all filter action?                               :

                 Specify the action to take if neither the specific
                 filter setting nor the global filter setting matches
                 an event, or if a filter setting that matches an event
                 is set to ignore. The choices are:

                 o  BLOCK - Discard the event.

                 o  PASS - Report the event.

                 * Description?                                           :

                 Specify an informational string that can be used to
                 describe the sink.

                 * Display UIDs?                                          :

                 Answering YES displays the entity's unique identifier,
                 which is generated when the entity is created.

                 * Client type?                                           :

                 Specify how the application is to accept the events
                 received by the sink. The choices are:

                 o  CONSOLE - Events go the operator's console (OPCOM).

                 o  DEVICE - Events go to a device.

                 o  FILE - Events go to a file.

                 If you answer FILE to the "Client type?" prompt, the
                 procedure displays the following prompt:

                 * File name?                                              :

                 Enter the file specification you want to use to capture
                 events (for example, sys$manager:evd_events.log).

                 If you answer DEVICE to the "Client type?" prompt, the
                 procedure displays the following prompt:

                 * Device name?                                            :

                 Enter the device you want to use to capture events (for
                 example, TWA1:).

                 * Configure another Sink?                            [NO] :

                 If you do not want to configure another sink, press
                 Return to proceed to the next prompt. If want to
                 configure another sink, enter YES and press Return.
                 The procedure returns you to the "Sink name?" prompt and
                 repeats the prompts required to configure another sink.

              5. If you want to configure an outbound stream, answer YES.

                 * Configure an Outbound Stream?                     [YES] :

                 Specify the outbound stream name that you want to manage
                 with this command (for example, local_stream).

                 * Outbound Stream name?                    [local_stream] :

                 Specify the number of octets that the outbound stream
                 allows to process events. This value is derived from
                 (but is not necessarily equal to) the value specified in
                 the maximum buffer size argument of the create command
                 (for example, 16384).

                 * Maximum buffer size?                                    :

                 Specify the number of seconds to wait between connection
                 attempts. The connect retry timer operates continuously
                 from the time the outbound stream is enabled until the
                 stream is disabled or until the connect timer enabled
                 characteristic is set to FALSE. If the outbound stream
                 is already connected to the sink when the timer expires,
                 no connection is attempted at that time. The timer
                 resets and connection attempts continue whenever the
                 timer expires.

                 * Connect retry timer?                                    :

                 Answer YES to have the connect retry timer operational.
                 Answer NO to disable it.

                 * Connect timer enabled?                                  :

                 Specify the number of seconds to wait before shutting
                 down an idle connection. A 0 value indicates that the
                 disconnect timer is not operating and that connections
                 are never disconnected automatically.

                 * Disconnect timer?                                       :

                 Specify the action to take if neither the specific
                 filter setting nor the global filter setting matches
                 an event or if a filter setting that matches an event is
                 set to Ignore. The choices are:

                 o  BLOCK - Discard the event.

                 o  PASS - Report the event.

                 * Catch all filter action?                                :

                 Specify the full DECdns object name of the sink
                 associated with this outbound stream. This object name
                 is used to make the connection with the sink.

                 * Sink object?                                             :

                 Specify the full node name (DECdns namespace name
                 included) of the sink associated with outbound stream.

                 * Sink node?                                               :

                 Specify the sink Session Control end user specification
                 of the sink associated with this outbound stream (for
                 example, number=82).

                 * Sink end user?                                           :

                 Specify the sink address tower of the sink associated
                 with this outbound stream.

                 * Sink address?                                            :

                 If you do not want to configure another outbound stream,
                 press Return to proceed to the next prompt. If you want
                 to configure another outbound stream, enter YES and
                 press Return. The procedure returns you to the "Outbound
                 Stream name?" prompt and repeats the prompts required to
                 configure another outbound stream.

              6. Answer YES to use the Phase IV Relay. This allows you
                 to record and process events that occur on an OpenVMS
                 system running DECnet-VAX Phase IV software. The Phase
                 IV Relay entity receives the events from a Phase IV
                 node, encapsulates them, and posts them in the DECnet-
                 Plus system Event Dispatcher.

                 * Do you want to generate NCL configuration scripts? [YES] :

                 If you answer YES, the configuration program uses the
                 information you entered to create the Event Dispatcher
                 NCL script. The configuration program then returns to
                 the Configuration Options menu. To implement the Event
                 Dispatcher NCL script, reboot the system or disable the
                 entity and execute the script.

                 If you answer NO, the configuration procedure returns to
                 the Configuration Options menu and does not generate NCL
                 scripts.

        3.9 Reconfiguring the Application Database

              To reconfigure the application database, proceed as follows
              from the Configuration Options menu:

              * Which configuration option to perform?                 [1] : 7

              Select Option 7 and press Return.

              * Do you want to ADD or DELETE an Application?         [ADD] :

              Answer ADD to create the application entity on the local
              node, allocate resources for it, and open the service
              interface. Answer DELETE to delete the entity and reclaim
              associated resources. Entering either ADD or DELETE in
              reply to this prompt displays the following prompt. The
              NOTES application is used here as an example.

              * What is the name of the Application?                        : NOTES

              When defining an application, you must identify the
              name of the object. DECnet object names are descriptive
              alphanumeric strings of up to 12 characters.

              application, the procedure skips the next two prompts.

              * Are you sure you want to DELETE this application?      [NO]:

              If you want to delete the application, answer YES.

              * Do you want to generate NCL configuration scripts?   [YES] :

              If you want to generate the NCL configuration scripts,
              answer YES.

              If you are adding an application, the procedure displays
              the following prompt:

              * What is the destination type for 'notes'?           [NAME] :

              The destination type can be either NAME or NUMBER. To
              select NAME, press Return. To select NUMBER, enter NUMBER
              and press Return.

              If you select NAME, the procedure displays the following
              prompt:

              * What is the destination name for 'notes'?                 :

              Your reply to this prompt can be either the application
              name (for example, NOTES) or a destination object name (for
              example, IAF:.SALES.BOSTON). The destination name is the
              DECdns full name of the node that provides the application.

              The application name can be from 1 to 16 characters. The
              destination object name can be a maximum of 512 characters
              and is entered in this format:

              NamespaceNickname:.DirectoryPath.NodeObject

              If you enter NUMBER, the procedure displays the following
              prompt:

              * What is the destination number for 'notes'?                : 33

              DECnet software uses object numbers as unique object
              identifiers. Object numbers have a range of 1 to 255.
              Generic objects such as MAIL and FAL have object numbers
              that are recognized throughout the network. User-defined
              images can have unique object numbers; numbers between 128
              and 255 are reserved for this purpose.

              name matching one of the values in the destination names:
              attribute.

              * Incoming Alias for 'notes' enabled?                 [TRUE] :

              Specify how the specified application responds to incoming
              connect requests directed to the alias node address. If
              you specify FALSE, the application does not accept incoming
              connect requests that have been directed to the alias node
              address.

              * Incoming Proxy for 'notes' enabled?                 [TRUE] :

              Controls whether incoming proxy requests are honored. If
              you specify FALSE, requests to invoke proxies on incoming
              requests are ignored.

              * Outgoing Alias for 'notes' enabled?                 [TRUE] :

              Specify whether a particular object uses the alias node
              identifier in its outgoing connect requests. If you specify
              FALSE, the specified object cannot use the alias node
              address in its outgoing connect requests.

              * Outgoing Proxy for 'notes' enabled?                 [TRUE] :

              Specify the default action to execute when a user does
              not explicitly specify whether to invoke a proxy. If you
              specify FALSE, there will be no default action.

              If you specify TRUE, then by default, the remote node
              name is passed to the application in synonym form. If a
              synonym is not available, the full name is used. If you
              specify FALSE, the full name is passed to the application
              by default.

              * What is the Incoming OSI TSEL for 'notes'?                 :

              Specify the transport service access point (TSAP)
              identifier for which the specified application accepts
              connections.

              * What is the User Name for 'notes'?          [NOTES$SERVER] :

              Enter the user name that you want to use when creating the
              account for the application you are configuring.

              If you do not want to create an account for that
              application, you can either enter NONE and press Return,
              or press the space bar and press Return.

              If you decide to create an account for that application,
              the following two questions appear:

              * What UIC should 'notes' use?         [[200,200]] : [376,377]

              Specify the UIC allocated upon creation of this application
              entity instance.

              * Rights identifiers for 'NOTES$SERVER'?         :net$examine,

              Specify the rights identifiers (if any) needed by the
              application. If there are two or more rights identifiers,
              separate them with commas.

              The procedure then creates the account for the application
              you want configured and displays the following messages:

              If you answer YES, the configuration program uses the
              information you entered to create an application NCL script
              and displays the following information:

                The net$configure procedure only provides checksums of
                those NCL management scripts it creates or modifies.
                It does not provide checksums of user-modified NCL
                scripts.

                ______________________________________________________

              The configuration program then returns to the Configuration
              Options menu. To implement the application NCL script,
              reboot the system or disable the entity and execute the
              script.

              If you answer NO, the configuration procedure returns to
              the Configuration Options menu and does not generate NCL
              scripts.

        3.10 Reconfiguring the MOP Client Database

              To reconfigure the MOP client database, proceed as follows

              Specify the Phase IV node name you want passed as the host
              node name when a client is loaded. This name is passed in a
              load characteristics message; whether it is needed depends
              on the software being loaded.

              * Do you want to generate NCL configuration scripts?   [YES] :

              If you answer YES, the configuration program uses the
              information you have entered to create the MOP client
              NCL script. The configuration program then returns to the
              Configuration Options menu. To implement the MOP client NCL
              script, reboot the system or disable the entity and execute
              the script.

              If you answer NO, the configuration procedure returns to
              the Configuration Options menu and does not generate NCL
              scripts.

        3.11 Reconfiguring Event, MOP Client, Application Entities, and
             the Naming Search Path

              You can use user-defined site-specific NCL scripts for the
              Event Dispatcher, MOP client, application, and search path
              entities. (See Section 2.2.4 for further information about
              creating the site-specific search path script.)

              The network startup procedure calls four site-specific NCL
              scripts (if they exist) when the network is started. These
              scripts must be in SYS$MANAGER. They are called immediately
              after their DIGITAL-supplied counterparts are executed. The
              following table lists the scripts and their counterparts.

              ___________________________________________________________

              NET$MOP_CLIENT_LOCAL.NCL________NET$MOP_CLIENT_STARTUP.NCL_

              These scripts are user-defined and user-maintained and
              thus will not be overwritten or deleted by net$configure.
              DIGITAL recommends that whenever possible, you place your
              site-specific changes in these user-defined NCL scripts.

                name).

                ______________________________________________________

              If you must make changes to the standard NCL scripts
              and you want to retain your modifications after invoking
              net$configure, you can either manually edit the NCL script
              to replace the user modifications or rename the appropriate
              NET$entity_STARTUP.NCL-OLD script back to NET$entity_
              STARTUP.NCL. Be sure to incorporate any new changes
              as well. The net$configure.com procedure flags these
              modifications the next time it checksums the scripts.

        3.12 Reconfiguring the Cluster Alias

              All or some nodes that are OpenVMS Cluster members can be
              represented in the network as a single node by establishing
              an alias for the cluster. The alias allows users access
              to common resources on the OpenVMS Cluster without knowing
              which nodes are members of the cluster. It is not necessary
              for every member of the cluster to join the alias. Refer
              to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_NET_MGMT) guide for more
              information about setting up a OpenVMS Cluster alias.

              To reconfigure the cluster alias, proceed as follows:

              * Which configuration option to perform?                 [1] : 9

              Select Option 9 and press Return.

              * Do you want to ADD or DELETE an alias?               [ADD] :

              Answer ADD to add the specified node to the cluster. Answer
              DELETE to remove the specified node from the cluster.

              * Full name of Cluster Alias                                 :

              Specify the full name that uniquely identifies the cluster
              alias node (for example, IAF:.SALES.BOSTON).

              If you are removing a node from the cluster, the procedure
              displays the following prompt:

              * Are you sure you want to DELETE this alias?            [NO]:

              If you answer YES to this prompt, the node is removed from
              the cluster.

        3.12.1 Specifying an Address

              If you are adding a node to the cluster, the procedure
              displays the following prompt:

              * Cluster Alias Phase IV Address (aa.nnnn OR AA-00-04-00-xx-xx) :

              Specify either the DECnet Phase IV node address or Ethernet
              physical address of the alias. The Phase IV node address
              has the format area-number.node-number (for example,
              63.171). The Ethernet physical address has the format AA-
              00-04-00-xx-xx, where xx-xx is calculated from the Phase IV
              node address. To determine the Ethernet physical address,
              proceed as follows:

              1. Convert the Phase IV node address to its decimal
                 equivalent as follows:

                 (area-number * 1024) + node-number = decimal equivalent
                 (For example, (63 * 1024) + 171 = 64683 decimal)

              2. Convert the decimal node address to its hexadecimal
                 equivalent and reverse the order of the bytes to form
                 the hexadecimal node address.

                 (For example, 64683 decimal = FCAB hexadecimal,
                    reversed = ABFC hexnodeaddress)

              3. Incorporate the hexadecimal node address in the
                 following format:

                 AA-00-04-00-hexnodeaddress
                 (For example, AA-00-04-00-AB-FC)

        3.12.2 Determining Selection Weight

              The selection weight determines the number of sequential
              incoming connects passed to this alias member node in
              the round-robin sequence before proceeding to the next
              member node in the sequence. A value of zero means this
              node is not eligible to receive incoming connections to
              this alias address. Selection weight apportions incoming
              alias connections according to the capacity of each alias
              member.

              For example, nodes with greater capacity should have
              larger values of selection weight, while OpenVMS Cluster
              satellites should generally have a value of zero. Specify
              a nonzero selection weight if this node is connected
              locally to a dual-ported disk, or if it will be serving
              any multihost disks, such as RFxx or HSC-connected disks,
              to other cluster members. Values between 0 and 10 are
              suggested.

              * Selection weight for this cluster node [0 for satellites]  :

              Enter a selection weight and press Return.

        3.13 Replace MOP Client Configuration

              To replace a MOP Client Configuration, select Option 10
              from the ADVANCED Configuration Option menu.

              * Which configuration option to perform?                 [1] : 10

              The following question appears:

              * Load MOP on this system?                             [YES] :

              By default, MOP is not started by NET$STARTUP. In order
              to make this system service MOP requests, NET$STARTUP_
              MOP must be defined to signal NET$STARTUP to load
              the MOP software. This symbol is normally defined in
              SYS$STARTUP:NET$LOGICALS.COM.

              Answering YES to this question will modify
              SYS$STARTUP:NET$LOGICALS.COM for you, to enable MOP service
              on this system. Answering NO will remove the logical name
              definition from SYS$STARTUP:NET$LOGICALS.COM. Note that
              this will have no effect if the NET$STARTUP_MOP is defined
              elsewhere.

              If you answer YES, the following displays:

              %NET$CONFIGURE-I-MOPCLIENTFND, MOP client NCL script already exists

              * Replace MOP Client script file?                       [NO] : yes

              Answer YES to create a new MOP Client NCL script file,
              otherwise press Return.

              The procedure displays the Summary of Configuration and
              asks the following:

              * Do you want to generate NCL configuration scripts?   [YES] :

              If you answer YES, the configuration program uses the
              information you entered to generate modified NCL scripts
              and, in some cases, automatically modify the system's
              configuration. The configuration program then returns to
              the Configuration Options menu.

              If you answer NO, the configuration procedure returns to
              the Configuration Options menu and does not generate any
              modified NCL scripts.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                CAUTION: If your cluster is running mixed versions
                of DECnet, you cannot use this feature. Instead, you
                must configure the nodes independently by running
                net$configure on each system.

                ______________________________________________________

              To select this option, you must have already configured
              the system using the ADVANCED configuration option, and
              net$configure is executing on a cluster system.

              Autoconfigure Phase IV Cluster Nodes (Submenu Option 1)

              If you select Option 1, it scans the system disk for
              evidence of satellite nodes that have not yet been
              configured to run DECnet-Plus. If it finds one, it creates
              sys$specific:[sys$startup]net$autoconfigure.com, causing
              the cluster member to automatically configure DECnet-Plus
              the next time it reboots. The procedure prompts you to
              enter the full name of a cluster alias.

              * Fullname of cluster alias:                                 :

              Supply the full node name of the cluster alias. If none is
              supplied, no cluster alias is configured for the systems
              being upgraded.

              * Device containing system roots            [SYS$SYSDEVICE:] :

              Configuring cluster satellites involves finding the system
              root from which the satellite boots. Normally, this is
              SYS$SYSDEVICE:, although it is possible to install system
              roots to a different volume.

              The device given in response to this question is searched
              for all system roots. Those found that do not contain
              a checksum database are assumed to be Phase IV nodes,
              and are candidates for being flagged for DECnet-Plus
              autoconfiguration.

              * Upgrade Phase IV cluster member FIGS?                [Yes] :

              A system root was found that does not contain a DECnet-
              Plus checksum database, and is therefore assumed to be a
              Phase IV system. Answering YES to this question causes
              that cluster node to be flagged to run a DECnet-Plus
              autoconfiguration on its next reboot.

              * Which configuration option to perform?                 [1] : 2

              If you select Option 2, it prompts for a cluster member
              name (and system root location). Once supplied, all
              net$configure modifications are made to the DECnet
              configuration for that cluster member. Note that this only
              allows a subset of configuration options.

              * Cluster node name to be configured:                        : TPZERO

              This is simply the node name of the cluster member to
              configure. The net$configure procedure attempts to find
              the system root for that cluster member (by scanning
              NET$MOP_CLIENT_STARTUP.NCL) to supply defaults for the
              two questions that follow.

              * Device for TPZERO root:                    [SYS$SYSDEVICE] :

              In configuring a cluster member other than the system on
              which net$configure executes, you must specify the location
              of the member's system root. The location is the disk
              device on which the cluster member's system root resides.

              The default answer to this is either SYS$SYSDEVICE or
              the root device found for that system in NET$MOP_CLIENT_
              STARTUP.NCL

              * Directory for TPZERO root:                                 : SYS2

              In configuring a cluster member other than the system on
              which net$configure executes, you must also specify the
              system root directory. The system root directory is of the
              form "SYSxxxx," where "xxxx" is the hexadecimal root number
              from which that member loads.

              Note that before net$configure returns to the main menu,
              it warns that all subsequent options will be applied to
              the cluster node just specified. Notice also that Option 5
              (Configure Timezones) is not present when configuring other
              cluster members.

              If you select Option 3, it clears the action of Option 2;
              all subsequent net$configure modifications are made to the
              local system (as when net$configure was started).

              * Which configuration option to perform?                 [1] : 3

        3.15 Configuring Cluster Script Locations

              This option allows the system manager to make the network
              startup scripts for NET$APPLICATION_STARTUP, NET$MOP_
              CLIENT_STARTUP, and NET$EVENT_STARTUP to be common for
              all cluster nodes. That is, a single copy of the script
              is shared by all systems in the cluster. This allows
              a single configuration for those scripts to be common
              to all systems, ensuring that all systems have the same
              application, MOP client, and event logging configuration.

              It does this by copying the script from the SYS$SPECIFIC
              directory to the SYS$COMMON directory. Note that when
              it does so, it does not delete the script from the
              SYS$SPECIFIC directories for the other cluster systems.
              You must do this by rerunning the dialog for all cluster
              members.

              To select this option, you must have already configured
              the system using the ADVANCED configuration option, and
              net$configure is executing on a cluster system.

              defaults. Selecting Option 11 allows the manager to delete
              these local overrides so that TPZERO will use the cluster
              common versions.

              The configuration program then returns to the Configuration
              Options menu. To implement the alias NCL script, reboot the
              system or disable the entity and execute the script.

              If you answer NO, the configuration procedure returns to
              the Configuration Options menu and does not generate any
              NCL scripts.

                             Configuring VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access


              This chapter describes how to configure the VAX P.S.I. and
              VAX P.S.I. Access software.

        4.1 Steps in Configuring VAX P.S.I.

              See Figure 4-1 and take the following steps to configure
              your VAX P.S.I. system:

              1. Plan your configuration (see the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_
                 PLANNING) and Section 4.2).

              2. Make a note of the information you need during the
                 configuration program, using Section 4.3.

              3. Run the configuration program (see Section 4.4).

              4. Run the net$configure procedure (in either BASIC or
                 ADVANCED mode) to configure your network.

              5. Carry out the postconfiguration tasks: starting VAX
                 P.S.I. and testing your configuration (see Section 4.5).

        4.2 Planning Your VAX P.S.I. Configuration

              This section introduces the aspects of your proposed
              configuration that you need to consider before you run
              the configuration program.

        4.2.1 Configuring Access, Native, and Multihost Systems

              There are three types of VAX P.S.I. systems:

              o  Access

              o  Native

              o  Multihost

              Refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_PLANNING) for an
              explanation of VAX P.S.I. systems.

              The type(s) you can configure depends on the license(s)
              that you have installed. Table 4-1 summarizes the various
              possible configurations.

        4.2.2 The VAX P.S.I. Configuration Program

              The VAX P.S.I. configuration program has many sections,
              but not all sections are relevant to all types of systems.
              Table 4-2 shows the sections that apply to each type of
              system.

        4.2 Planning Your VAX P.S.I. Configuration


              ___________________________________________________________

              The VAX P.S.I. configuration program automatically skips
              sections that do not apply to your type of system.

        4.2.3 Sections in the VAX P.S.I. Configuration Program

              This section explains the purpose of each section in the
              P.S.I. configuration program.

              Lines and DTEs

              Choose a line on your system to configure for X.25
              communications. You must configure at least one synchronous
              line unless you intend to use LLC2 exclusively.

              PVCs

              Your DTE can communicate with a remote DTE using either an
              SVC (switched virtual circuit) or a PVC (permanent virtual
              circuit). A PVC is a permanent association between two
              specific DTEs.

              Two DTEs connected by a PVC can communicate without the
              need for call clearing or call setup.

              Complete this section if you have requested this facility
              from your PSDN.

              Groups

              If your DTE belongs to a closed user group (CUG), it can
              communicate freely with remote DTEs that are also members
              of that CUG. Its communications with other DTEs may be
              restricted, depending on your PSDN subscription options.

              You must complete this section if you have requested this
              facility from your PSDN.

              LLC2

              LLC2 is a data link protocol used on LANs, over which the
              X.25 Packet-Level Protocol (PLP) is run.

              You must set up an LLC2 DTE for each remote system to which
              you want to connect on the LAN. You can set up one or more
              LLC2 DTEs per LAN connection.

              Remote DTE Classes

              Use this section to specify the connector system(s) that
              your Access system uses.

                               4.2 Planning Your VAX P.S.I. Configuration


              X.29 and P.S.I. Mail

              This section allows you to add support for X.29
              communications and for P.S.I. Mail.

              You need X.29 support if your VAX P.S.I. system is to
              communicate with character-mode terminals.

              P.S.I. Mail is an extension of OpenVMS Mail that lets
              you send mail messages to and receive them from other VAX
              P.S.I. systems across a PSDN.

              Gateway Clients

              You must create gateway clients to allow your multihost
              system to pass incoming calls to the correct client system.
              A gateway client identifies a client system or group of
              client systems that use this multihost system to receive
              incoming calls.

              In this section, you also set up filter(s) for gateway
              clients. You must set up at least one filter for each
              gateway client. See filters for more about filters.

              Filters

              Filters are sets of characteristics that can be matched
              to fields in an incoming call request packet. If
              the characteristics in an incoming call match the
              characteristics you set in a filter, then the call is
              passed to the gateway client or the application associated
              with that filter.

              You must supply a filter name and a priority for each
              filter. You may leave all the other parameters unspecified.

              The more parameters you specify in a filter, the more
              specific is that filter. For example, you could create a
              filter with most of its parameters unspecified and with a
              low priority to act as a "catchall" for unexpected calls.

              Applications

              You must specify any X.25 or X.29 applications on your
              system to allow incoming calls for those applications to
              succeed.

              You must supply the name of the command file that starts
              the application. You may also supply a user name for the
              application.

              Do not specify any applications that do not receive calls.

              In this section, you also set up filter(s) for
              applications. You must set up at least one filter for each
              application. See filters for more about filters.

              Declaring a Network Process

              X.25 and X.29 programs on your system can issue $QIO(IO$_
              ACPCONTROL) calls to declare themselves as network
              processes. Each
              $QIO(IO$_ACPCONTROL) specifies a filter used to determine
              which calls are able to access the program.

              The filter specified by $QIO(IO$_ACPCONTROL) can be one of
              two types:

              o  Static

                 In this case, $QIO(IO$_ACPCONTROL) names a filter that
                 already exists on your system. Complete this section if
                 you want to create static filters for use by $QIO(IO$_
                 ACPCONTROL).

              o  Dynamic

                 In this case, the filter characteristics are specified
                 in the $QIO(IO$_ACPCONTROL) call. The filter created
                 in this way by the $QIO(IO$_ACPCONTROL) call ceases to
                 exist when the program exits. Complete this section
                 if you want to name the dynamic filters created by
                 $QIO(IO$_ACPCONTROL).

              If your programs issue only $QIO(IO$_ACPCONTROL) calls that
              use unnamed dynamic filters, you do not need to complete
              this section.

              Templates

              Your system uses a template to make outgoing calls. A
              template sets various parameters for each call made using
              that template.

              A template called "default" is created automatically on
              your system.

              Security

              Set up security to prevent unauthorized use of your VAX
              P.S.I. system. There are six security sections:

              o  X.25 Security

                 This allows you to choose whether to set up X.25
                 security. If you do not set up X.25 security, any remote
                 DTE can make a call to your system (provided it matches
                 one of your filters), and any user on your system can
                 make outgoing calls to any remote DTE. If you choose not
                 to set up X.25 security, you do not see the following
                 five security sections.

              o  Incoming Security for Applications

                 You see this section only if you have an Access,
                 Native, or Multihost system on which you have set up
                 applications.

                 Complete this section if you want your applications to
                 be able to receive calls from remote systems.

              o  Outgoing Security for Local Processes

                 Complete this section if you want users on your system
                 to be able to make calls to remote systems.

              o  Incoming Security for Network Processes

                 Complete this section if you have X.25 or X.29 programs
                 that issue $QIO(IO$_ACPCONTROL) calls to declare
                 themselves as network processes.

              o  Incoming Security for Gateway Clients

                 You see this section only if you have a Multihost system
                 on which you have set up gateway clients.

                 Complete this section if you want your system to be able
                 to pass incoming calls to client systems.

              o  Outgoing Security for Accessing Systems

                 You see this section only if you have a Multihost
                 system.

                 Complete this section if you want your system to be able
                 to make outgoing calls on behalf of client systems.

              NCL Script

              When you are satisfied that all the information you entered
              is complete and correct, the configuration program creates
              two NCL scripts using the information you provided.

              When the NCL scripts have been created, you are asked
              if you want to run a command file called psi$security_
              identifiers.com.

              This file is created by the configuration program to add
              certain rights identifiers to the system rights database on
              your system. The rights to be added depend on the security
              information you have supplied.

              You can run the command file from within the configuration
              procedure, or you can exit from the configuration program
              and run the command file later. Note that you cannot start
              VAX P.S.I. until you have run this command file. This is
              true even if you have selected not to set up X.25 security
              for your system.

              If you edit the command procedure before running it, you
              must make corresponding changes to the NCL scripts before
              attempting to start VAX P.S.I.

        4.4 Running the VAX P.S.I. Configuration Program

              To configure your VAX P.S.I. system, you need to run the
              psi$configure.com command procedure.

              This procedure allows you to set up the VAX P.S.I. system's
              permanent configuration database.

        4.4.1 Starting the VAX P.S.I. Configuration Program

              To start the program, log in to any account that has OPER
              and SYSPRV privileges and enter the command:

              $ @sys$manager:psi$configure

        Configuring VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access
        4.4 Running the VAX P.S.I. Configuration Program


        4.4.2 Using the VAX P.S.I. Configuration Program

              The configuration program consists of a number of sections,
              each corresponding to a logical group of information.
              Each section consists of one or more screens on which you
              can enter data. All sections (with the exception of the
              X.29 and Mail support section) also have an introductory
              information screen.

              Most sections are optional. These sections begin with a
              question of the form: "Do you want to set up X?" If you
              select Yes, you go through the rest of the section. If
              you select No, you go directly to the next new section,
              although you can decide at a later stage to complete that
              section (See Section 4.4.3).

        4.4.2.1 Entering Information

              The program prompts you for information in two ways:

              o  For some questions, you choose your answer from a menu
                 by using the arrow keys and pressing Return.

              o  For other questions, you type data into a field and
                 press Return.

              Horizontal Scrolling

              Usually, when you type data into a field, you can see the
              entire field on the screen. However, in some cases, the
              maximum length of the data you are allowed to type is
              too long to fit into the field shown on the screen; for
              example, a node name, which may be up to 400 characters.
              In such cases, the field scrolls horizontally as you enter
              data.

              Note that horizontal scrolling works only if the keyboard
              is in Insert mode, not if it is in Overstrike mode. The
              words Insert or Overstrike appear in the upper right-hand
              corner of the screen to indicate which mode you are using.
              Press Ctrl/A to change from one mode to the other.

              When you have entered all the required information on a
              screen, a new screen appears automatically. You cannot move
              forward until you have completed the required fields.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The configuration program indicates it is processing
                input by flashing the message working in the bottom
                left-hand corner of the screen.

                ______________________________________________________

        4.4.2.2 Moving Within a Section

              To move backward within a section, press the Prev Screen
              key. You are allowed to move backward within a section
              whether you have finished it or not. However, you can move
              backward only as far as the first screen of the section.
              To reach another section, use the Sections Menu (see
              Section 4.4.3).

              If you have moved back to look at completed screens, you
              can move forward again by pressing the Next Screen key. Do
              this until you reach an incomplete screen. Then complete
              the required fields on that screen before moving on.

        4.4.3 Options Menu

              When you leave the last screen in a section, an Options
              menu appears.

              Generally, the Options menu for a section provides the
              following choices:

              o  Continue to new section

              o  Add an x

              o  Modify an x

              o  Delete an x

              o  Go to Sections menu

              where x is the item you created in that section.

              For example, the PVC Options menu provides the following
              choices:

              o  Continue to a new section

              o  Add a PVC

              o  Modify a PVC

              o  Delete a PVC

        4.4 Running the VAX P.S.I. Configuration Program


              o  Go to Sections menu

              These options are described here.

              Continue

              Choose this option when you finish entering or amending
              information in the current section. The configuration
              program then displays the first screen in the next unseen
              section.

              Add

              Choose this option to add another item in this section.

              For example, when you finish entering data for a PVC and
              you want to add another PVC, choosing this option takes you
              back to the first data entry screen for PVCs.

              Modify

              Choose this option to modify some or all of the information
              you provided previously about an item.

              For example, if you choose this option from the PVC Options
              menu, the next screen lists all the PVCs defined so far.
              You select one of these (PVC1, for example), and then go
              back to the first data entry screen for PVCs. The fields
              contain the information you provided when you first set up
              PVC1. You can modify any of this information. Use the Next
              Screen key and the Prev Screen key to move between screens
              that you do not want to alter.

              Delete

              Choose this option to delete an item in this section.

              For example, if you choose this option from the PVC Options
              menu, a list of all PVCs defined on your system so far
              appears on the screen. Select one of these (PVC2, for
              example), and you are asked for confirmation that this
              is the one you want to delete.

              Go to Sections Menu

              Choose this option to go to the Sections menu. From there
              you can go on to the Options menu of a different section.

        4.4.4 Creating NCL Script

              The final section in the configuration program is Create
              the NCL Script. You are asked if you want to create the NCL
              script.

              o  If you answer YES, the configuration program uses the
                 information you have entered to create two files of NCL
                 commands.

              o  If you answer NO, you see a Sections menu, showing all
                 the completed sections. At this point, you can return
                 to any of these sections and modify, add, or delete
                 information. When you want to create an NCL script, go
                 to the Sections menu from any of the Options menus, and
                 select Create the NCL Script.

              o  After the NCL scripts are created, you are asked if
                 you want to run a command file called psi$security_
                 identifiers.com.

                 This file is created by the configuration program, to
                 add certain rights identifiers to the system rights
                 database on your system. The rights to be added depend
                 on the security information you have supplied.

                 You can run the command file from within the
                 configuration procedure, or you can exit from the
                 configuration program and run the command file later.
                 Note that you cannot start VAX P.S.I. until you have
                 run this command file. This is true even if you have
                 selected not to set up X.25 security for your system.

                 If you edit the command procedure before running it,
                 you must make corresponding changes to the NCL scripts
                 before attempting to start VAX P.S.I.

        4.4.5 Exiting the Program

              Once it has created the NCL scripts, the program returns to
              the main menu. You can then choose the Exit option to exit
              the program.

              If, for some reason, the program cannot create the NCL
              script, an error message appears at the foot of the screen
              and the cursor stays on the question, "Do you wish to
              create the NCL scripts now?" You must correct the problem
              before you answer YES to this question.

        4.4 Running the VAX P.S.I. Configuration Program


              To quit the program, without creating a set of NCL scripts,
              press the F8 key; however, this deletes all the information
              you entered so far.

        4.4.6 Requirement to Complete VAX P.S.I. Configuration

              You cannot leave the configuration program unfinished.
              That is, you cannot retain the data you entered if you exit
              before you create a valid configuration.

              If you quit prematurely by pressing F8, you receive a
              warning message, asking for confirmation. If you confirm
              that you want to quit, everything you have entered so far
              is lost.

        4.4.7 Getting Help

              You can get help at any time during the program by pressing
              the Help key.

        4.4.7.1 Getting Help on a Specific Field or Menu Choice

              If you press the Help key while the cursor is on a
              particular field or menu choice, three lines of text
              appear near the bottom of the screen. These lines tell
              you what sort of value is expected in that field, or what
              the implications are of making that choice.

              If you press the Help key again, the screen is replaced
              by additional information about that field or menu choice.
              Press the F10 key to leave help and return to the screen
              from which you pressed the Help key originally.

        4.4.7.2 Getting General Help

              If you press the Help key while on any of the introductory
              screens, the screen is replaced by general information
              about that section. For example, pressing the Help key
              while on the PVC introduction screen brings up general
              information on PVCs.

              You can also reach this section help from the Options menu
              for any particular section.

              You can get help on the configuration program (for example,
              which keys you can use, how to navigate between screens)
              by pressing the Help key while you are on any other Help
              screen.

        4.5 Testing VAX P.S.I.

              This section explains how to run the VAX P.S.I.
              configuration test program.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Before you can test the VAX P.S.I. configuration, you
                must run the net$configure.com configuration procedure
                (in either BASIC or ADVANCED mode) to configure the
                system on the network.

                ______________________________________________________

              You use the configuration test program (CTP) to check any
              synchronous DTEs (and associated PVCs) that your system
              uses to make or receive calls.

              You can operate the CTP in one of three modes:

              o  Send/Receive

              o  Receive Only

              o  Send Only

              In Send/Receive mode, you can do two types of testing:

              o  Loopback testing, in which calls are sent to the PSDN
                 and then looped back to your system. The PSDN used for
                 the CTP must allow loopback from the network to your
                 system.

              o  Testing to a remote DTE, in which calls are sent to and
                 received from a remote DTE.

              In Receive Only and Send Only modes, you can only test to a
              remote DTE.

                 must be up and running. To check, enter the following
                 commands.

                 Native or Multihost:

                 ncl> show x25 protocol dte dte-name state

                 Access:

                 ncl> show node connector-node-id -
                 _ncl> x25 protocol dte dte-name state

                 If the status of your DTE is not shown as RUNNING, wait
                 for 2 minutes and try again. If your DTE is still not
                 RUNNING, refer to the X.25 Problem Solving guide.

              Remote System

              o  The remote system must have VAX P.S.I. V4.3 or later
                 configured and running.

              o  You must know the DTE address and subaddress of the
                 remote system.

        4.5.2 Running the CTP

              You can run the CTP either interactively or as a network
              object. When the CTP is set up as a network object, it can
              only handle incoming calls (either from a remote system or
              calls that have been looped back from the PSDN).

        4.5.2.1 Running the CTP Interactively

              Enter the following command:

              $ run sys$test:psi$ctp

              After some introductory screens, you are asked if you want
              to run the CTP in Send/Receive mode, Receive Only mode, or
              Send Only mode.

              o  If you run the CTP in Send/Receive mode, you can
                 test your system's ability to communicate with a PSDN
                 (loopback testing) or with remote systems.

              o  If you run the CTP in Receive Only mode or Send Only
                 mode, you can test your system's ability to make calls
                 to or receive calls from remote systems.

        4.5.2.2 Running the CTP as a Network Object

              Enter the following command:

              $ mcr ncl @sys$test:psi$ctp_add_netobj

              To run the CTP as a network object automatically when
              you start VAX P.S.I., you should add the above line to
              psi$startup.com.

              To remove the CTP as a network object, enter the following
              command:

              $ mcr ncl @sys$test:psi$ctp_rem_netobj

        4.6 Changing Your VAX P.S.I. Configuration

              To modify an existing configuration:

              o  Run psi$configure.com (Section 4.4.1).

              o  At the main menu, choose Modify.

              o  The next screen is the Sections Menu, from which you can
                 modify, add to, or delete any of the information entered
                 previously.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                When you run the configuration program to modify your
                existing configuration, the configuration program
                retrieves the information you supplied the last time
                you ran the program.

                If you manually changed the NCL script produced by
                the configuration program, or if you dynamically
                changed your configuration by issuing NCL commands
                interactively, this changed information is lost when
                you select Modify, unless you quit the program (by
                pressing the F8 key) before asking it to create the
                NCL script.

                ______________________________________________________

        4.7 Creating a New VAX P.S.I. Configuration

              To delete your existing configuration and create a new set
              of NCL scripts:

              o  Run psi$configure.com (Section 4.4.1).

              o  At the main menu, choose Create.

                               Planning to Install X.25 for OpenVMS Alpha


        5.1 Product Description

              X.25 for OpenVMS Alpha enables appropriately configured
              systems to connect to an X.25 packet switched data network
              (PSDN) via an X.25 relay node on the same local area
              network (LAN), via an X.25 connector node, or directly
              using a synchronous communications device. Full details of
              the features and facilities provided by X.25 for OpenVMS
              Alpha are provided in the Software Product Description.
              For more conceptual information on PSDNs, refer to the
              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_USER).

              Throughout the rest of this section, the product X.25 for
              OpenVMS Alpha is referred to as X.25.

        5.2 Required Hardware

              To install X.25, you need the following hardware:

              o  A CD reader (if installing an Alpha version)

              o  A CD reader, magnetic tape drive, or TK50 tape drive (if
                 installing a VAX version)

              o  A terminal

              You can use either a hardcopy or video terminal to
              communicate with the operating system and respond to
              prompts from the installation procedure.

              If you intend to access a PSDN directly, an appropriate
              synchronous interface card is required. For details of the
              synchronous communications devices supported, refer to the
              System Support Addendum (SSA). The SSA is supplied with the
              X.25 Software Product Description (SPD) on the Media CD.

        5.3 Required Software


        5.3 Required Software

              X.25, Version 1.1-B, requires Version 7.1 of the OpenVMS
              operating system. Future X.25 releases may require higher
              versions of the operating system, as described in the
              online release notes associated with each product release.

              During the installation of X.25, a check is made for the
              required DECnet-Plus and WANDD software. If the DECnet-Plus
              software is not present, you are prompted to install it
              before proceeding. If the WANDD software is not present,
              the X.25 installation procedure automatically installs it.
              Note that X.25 cannot be run without the DECnet-Plus for
              OpenVMS software.

              You must install the following X.25 installation kits using
              the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility:

              o  DEC-AXPVMS-X25-V0100-B-1.PCSI

              o  DEC-AXPVMS-WANDD-V0100-B.1.PCSI

        5.4 Kit Location

              To obtain the directory location of the X.25 kit on the CD,
              refer to the OpenVMS Layered Products Compact Disc User's
              Guide that accompanies the CD distribution kit, or before
              starting installation, complete the following steps:

              1. To determine whether the CD drive is already mounted
                 (mount command), enter the following command:

                 $ show device device-name

              2. If it is not mounted, enter the appropriate mount
                 command to mount the CD (omit the /FOREIGN qualifier).

              3. To obtain the save-set name, use a directory command
                 specifying the directory file from the previous command:

                  $ directory dka400:[kits]*.pcsi

              If you are installing from a magnetic tape or a TK50, refer
              to the appropriate user guide for further instructions.

                              Preparing to Install X.25 for OpenVMS Alpha


              This chapter details the tasks you need to complete or
              consider before installing X.25.

        6.1 Inspecting the Distribution Kit

              The software bill of materials (BOM) included with your
              distribution kit shows the components of the kit. Compare
              the items you received against the BOM. Report any damaged
              or missing components to DIGITAL before continuing with the
              installation.

        6.2 Logging In to a Privileged Account

              To install X.25, you must be logged into an account that
              has SETPRV or at least the following privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

              The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility turns off
              BYPASS privilege at the start of the installation.

              To determine the default privileges of the installing
              account, log in and enter the following DCL command:

              $ show process/privileges

              If the account lacks the SETPRV privilege, do one of the
              following:

              o  Ask your system manager to use the AUTHORIZE utility to
                 modify the default privileges of the account to include
                 the SETPRV privilege

        Preparing to Install X.25 for OpenVMS Alpha
        6.2 Logging In to a Privileged Account


              o  Run the AUTHORIZE utility and make the changes yourself
                 if your account has the SYSPRV privilege:

                 $ set default sys$system
                 $ run authorize
                 UAF> modify account-name/privileges=(setprv)
                 UAF> exit

              To activate the change in privileges, log out and then log
              in again.

        6.3 Accessing the Online Release Notes

              You should review the release notes for a description of
              new features, differences between multiple versions of
              X.25, and changes in the installation procedure.

              To access the release notes, issue the following command:

              $ product extract release_notes x25 /source=dka400:[kits]
                        /file=filename

              In the above example, the directory on the CD in which
              the installation kit is located is referred to as
              dka400:[kits]. You should substitute this directory name
              with the actual directory location of the X.25 kit. Details
              on how to determine the directory location of the X.25 kit
              are provided in Section 5.4.

              The product selected is displayed and you are prompted
              whether to continue with the extraction.

              To extract the release notes, type YES and press Return.
              The release notes are written to the specified file, which
              you can display or print.

              If you do not use the /FILE qualifier to define
              the required location of the extracted release
              notes, the release notes are extracted into the file
              DEFAULT.PCSI$RELEASE_NOTES in the current directory.

              To cancel the extraction, type NO and press Return.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                After X.25 and WANDD are installed, the release notes
                file is located in SYS$HELP in the form of:

                   X25*RELEASE_NOTES.*

        6.4 Determining Process Account Quotas

              The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility requires that
              the installation account has, as a minimum, the quotas
              shown in Table 6-1.

              Table_6-1_Process_Quotas_for_the_Installing_Account________

              FILLM_____100______________________________________________

              Use the OpenVMS Authorize utility to verify and change
              process quotas for the installation account in the user
              authorization file (SYSUAF.DAT). (Some sites may restrict
              the use of the OpenVMS Authorize utility to certain
              accounts or people.)

              For example, to verify and then change the BYTLM quota for
              the account-name installation account, enter the following
              command sequence:

              ___________________________________________________________

              After you verify and change the quotas for the installation
              account, log out of the installation account and log in
              again. The new quotas will take effect and you can proceed
              with the installation.

              User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT. For
              more information about modifying account quotas, see the
              description of the Authorize utility in the OpenVMS system
              management documentation subkit.

        6.5 Determining Disk Space

              Installing X.25 and WANDD on your system requires
              approximately 12000 blocks of free disk storage space.
              This figure includes space to store the Release Notes in
              SYS$HELP.

              To determine the number of free disk space on the current
              system disk, enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

              $ show device sys$sysdevice

              If necessary, create enough free disk space to accommodate
              the installation of X.25.

                                        Installing X.25 for OpenVMS Alpha


              This chapter describes the tasks necessary for installing
              X.25. It also describes how to display a list of the files
              installed on your system during X.25 installation.

              Refer to Figure 7-1 as a guideline when installing X.25 for
              OpenVMS Alpha. Section 7.4 provides annotated examples of
              typical prompt and response sequences that are displayed
              during X.25 installation.

        7.1 Registering the X.25 Software License

              Before you run X.25 on a newly licensed node, you must
              first register a License Product Authorization Key (License
              PAK) using the License Management Facility (LMF). The
              License PAK may be shipped along with the kit if you
              ordered the license and media together; otherwise, it is
              shipped separately to a location based on your license
              order. If you are installing X.25 as an update on a node
              already licensed for this software, you have already
              completed the License PAK registration requirements.

        7.1 Registering the X.25 Software License


              A DECnet-Plus license allows the use of:

              o  X.25 over LLC2 for DECnet routing over X.25 or to
                 provide Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS) for
                 OSI transport

              o  DECnet routing over DEC HDLC (High-level Data Link
                 Control) over a synchronous communications line

              The X.25 product can now be installed and used on a system
              using the PAK associated with the X.25 Client product.
              If you are installing the X.25 product on such a system,
              remove the X.25 Client product before installing the X.25
              product.

              Full details of the licensing requirements are provided in
              the Software Product Description (SPD) on the media CD.

        7.2 Installing X.25 Using the DCL Interface

              For a description of all the features you can request when
              starting an installation (such as purging files and using
              a product configuration file), refer to DCL help for the
              product install command.

              To install X.25, enter the following command:

              $ product install x25 /source=dka400:[kits]

              If you do not use the /SOURCE qualifier, the
              system attempts to read the installation kit from
              pcsi$source:[kits].

              In the above example, the directory on the CD in which
              the installation kit is located is referred to as
              dka400:[kits]. You should substitute this directory name
              with the actual directory location of the X.25 kit. Details
              on how to determine the directory location of the X.25 kit
              are provided in Section 5.4.

        7.3 Files Installed on Your System

              The X.25 installation procedure installs a number of files
              on your system. To list the files, enter the following
              command:

              $ product show object /product=x25

        7.4 X.25 Installation and De-Installation Sample

              This section provides two annotated examples that show the
              prompt and response sequence presented when the POLYCENTER
              Software Installation utility is run to install X.25.

              This section also provides an annotated example that
              shows the prompt and response sequence presented when
              the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility is run to
              de-install X.25.

              In all examples, numbered callouts (1, 2, 3, . . . )
              indicate parts of the prompt and response sequence for
              which additional explanatory notes are provided. The notes
              are given at the end of each example.

              1  This command invokes the installation procedure for
                 X.25. The SOURCE and DESTINATION qualifiers have been
                 used to define the location of the source files and the
                 required location for the installed software.

              2  To accept the default values for the available
                 installation options, type YES or press Return.

                 To enter values other than the default values, type NO.
                 In this case, the installation procedure prompts you to
                 enter values for each of the installation options.

              3  The X.25 License PAK must be registered and loaded
                 before X.25 can be started. Details about registering
                 the X.25 License PAK are given in Section 7.1. If
                 the X.25 License PAK is not loaded before completing
                 the installation, X25$STARTUP (which is normally run
                 automatically at the end of the installation) must be
                 run manually after loading the License PAK.

              4  Responding YES to this question displays the currently
                 selected values for the installation options and prompts
                 you to verify that the selections are correct. If you do
                 not want to view and confirm the options selected, type
                 NO or press Return.

                           X.25 Post-Installation and Configuration Tasks


              This chapter describes the tasks to complete after X.25 has
              been installed.

        8.1 Configuring X.25

              After X.25 has been installed, you need to configure your
              system.

              You can use the DECnet-Plus configuration procedure
              (net$configure.com) to first configure X.25 and then
              configure DECnet over X.25. You can use either the BASIC
              or ADVANCED configuration option.

              The following steps summarize what you need to do to
              complete an X.25 configuration:

              1. Start the net$configure procedure.

              2. Select "Perform the entire configuration." This steps
                 you through to the X.25 series of configuration steps.

              3. Select the defaults for each of the questions by
                 pressing Return after each one. When you see the
                 question, "Do you want to configure X.25?" type YES
                 and press Return.

              4. Answer YES to the next several questions, then select
                 either the X25 BASIC or X25 ADVANCED configuration.

              5. Provide responses to the questions when prompted by
                 the configurator. This sets up your system using the
                 information given to you by your X.25 provider (the X.25
                 Access service you are using).

              6. When you have entered all the information required to
                 configure your X.25 system, the X.25 configurator saves
                 all your information in a CONFIG.DAT file (for example,
                 sys$startup:x25$basic_config.dat).

        X.25 Post-Installation and Configuration Tasks
        8.1 Configuring X.25


              7. After the X.25 configurator saves your information,
                 that portion of the configuration is complete. The
                 X.25 configurator then returns to the net$configure
                 procedure, which is still in progress.

              8. Enter the appropriate data link and routing circuit
                 names to use as they are requested (you can also use the
                 defaults by pressing Return).

              9. When the net$configure procedure asks, "Do you want to
                 configure DECnet over X.25?" type YES and press Return.

             10. Select the type of X.25 circuit you want to use.

             11. Enter the routing circuit name to use (or press Return
                 for the default).

             12. Enter the template name (or press Return for the
                 default).

             13. The net$configure procedure then continues with other
                 configuration questions for different transports.

              When you have provided answers to all of the configuration
              questions, the procedure displays a summary of
              configuration. It then redisplays the Configuration Options
              menu. At this point, the procedure is complete and you can
              exit.

              For a sample X.25 and DECnet over X.25 configuration, see
              Section 8.5.

              Full details on how to configure the product are provided
              in the X.25 for OpenVMS Alpha Configuration Guide. This
              guide is available in a separate kit. Refer to the SPD for
              appropriate part numbers to use for ordering the X.25 kit.

        8.2 Restart DECnet-Plus

              You must restart DECnet-Plus before starting the X.25
              software. To restart DECnet, enter the following command
              on each node:

              $ @sys$startup:net$startup

        8.3 Rebooting the System

              After you have completed the required post-installation
              tasks, reboot the system.

              X.25 software starts automatically when you reboot the
              system on which it is installed.

              To start the X.25 software manually, enter the following
              command from the SYSTEM account:

              $ @sys$startup:x25$startup.com

        8.4 De-installing X.25

              To de-install X.25, type the following command:

              $ product remove x25

              Invoking this command automatically removes the product
              files. Complete shutdown of X.25 does not occur until the
              system is next rebooted. An annotated example of the de-
              installation prompt and response sequence is provided in
              Section 7.4.

              To invoke the shutdown procedure manually, enter the
              following command from the SYSTEM account:

              $ @sys$startup:x25$shutdown.com

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                You do not have to remove X.25 before re-installing
                the same or a different version. If a version of the
                product exists on the system where you are attempting
                to install the same or another version of the product,
                the Software Integrator warns you that a version of
                the product is already installed. You can then choose
                whether to continue with the installation.

                   Logical channels used for Switched Virtual Circuits and Permane
                   Virtual Circuits are assigned in the following way:

                                <------------------------------------>
                        PVCs      Incoming           Two-way            Outgoing

                   <------------>          <--------------------------------------->

                  If you intend to configure PVCs, select SVC Logical Channel Ranges
                  that leave enough channels free for the required PVCs.

                  Incoming Logical Channel Range(s):  {[1..4095]}
                  Outgoing Logical Channel Range(s):  {[1..4095]}

                                               PVCs

                  A PVC (Permanent Virtual Circuit) is a permanent association
                  between two specific DTEs. Two DTEs connected by a PVC can
                  communicate without the need for call clearing or call setup.

                  Your subscription options will provide details of any PVCs
                  you can set up.

                  Do you wish to set up any PVCs ?  No   Yes

                                         Incoming Call Security

                  This section allows you to configure Incoming Call Security.
                  You can choose to allow all incoming calls, to allow no incoming
                  calls, or to restrict incoming access to particular systems.
                  If you choose to restrict incoming access you will be prompted
                  to enter the remote address prefixes (RAPs) of systems that
                  will be permitted to make calls to the local system.
                  Separate entry screens are presented for RAPs with Remote-
                  Charge, and  All access.

                  Do you want to:
                                    Allow All Incoming Access
                                    Allow No Incoming Access
                                    Restrict Incoming Access

                   This section allows you to configure the local system for
                   X.29 access.

                   X.29 access will allow users to access the local system remotely via
                   an X.25 network and to access remote systems via the X.25 network
                   from the local system.

                   Do you want X.29 support?   Yes   No

                   Your system will be configured for X.29 access, which will allow
                   users to access the local system remotely via an X.25 network
                   and to access remote systems via the X.25 network from the
                   local system.

                   You can specify a Network User Identity (NUI) to identify the
                   party to charge for the outgoing X.29 call.

        9.1 Product Descriptions

              FTAM

              FTAM is an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) product
              that implements the OSI File Transfer, Access, and
              Management standard ISO 8571 developed by the International
              Organization for Standards (ISO). Using FTAM, you can copy,
              append, delete, rename, and inspect the file attributes of
              local files, remote files, or both.

              Virtual Terminal

              DECnet-Plus Virtual Terminal is DIGITAL's implementation
              of the OSI Virtual Terminal standard. Virtual Terminal (VT)
              enables applications and systems supporting different types
              of terminals to interoperate with each other. Using VT, you
              can use your terminal to access any other system running
              VT, regardless of the type of system. You can also use the
              VT gateways for access to and from non-OSI systems.

              OSAK

              Open System Application Kernel (OSAK) is DIGITAL's
              implementation of the OSI upper layers. It provides OSI
              Session, Presentation and Application services. These
              services are used by OSI applications such as FTAM,
              VT, X.400, and X.500. In addition, by using the OSAK
              programming interfaces which provide access to OSI Session,
              Presentation and Application layers, users can develop
              applications that layer on DIGITAL's implementation of the
              OSI stack.

        Planning for the Installation
        9.2 Required Hardware


        9.2 Required Hardware

              The OSI applications installation procedure requires the
              following hardware:

              o  A CD reader (if installing an Alpha version)

              o  A CD reader, magnetic tape drive, or TK50 tape drive (if
                 installing a VAX version)

              o  A terminal

                 You can use either a hard copy or video terminal to
                 communicate with the operating system and respond to
                 prompts from the installation procedure.

        9.3 Required Software

              You must use the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility
              to install the OSI applications installation kit. This
              utility is provided as part of the operating system
              software.

              To install FTAM and VT, you must first install DECnet-Plus,
              and then install OSAK.

              To run the VT/Telnet gateways, you must have the DIGITAL
              TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS installed on your system.

        9.4 Kit Location

              To obtain the directory location of the OSI applications
              kit on the CD, refer to the OpenVMS Layered Products
              Compact Disc User's Guide that accompanies the CD
              distribution kit, or before starting installation, complete
              the following steps:

              1. To determine whether the CD drive is already mounted,
                 enter the following command:

                 $ show device device-name <Return>

              2. If it is not mounted, enter the appropriate MOUNT
                 command to mount the CD.

              3. To obtain the save-set name, use a DIRECTORY command
                 specifying the device name from the previous command.
                 For example:

                 $ directory DKA400:[kits]*.pcsi <Return>

              If you are installing from a TK50 or magnetic tape
              drive, refer to the appropriate user guide for further
              instructions.

        9.5 Time Required to Install

              The time required to install the OSI applications
              depends on the media type, the CPU type, and your system
              configuration. In general, the procedure should require
              less than 15 minutes.

                                Preparing to Install the OSI Applications


              This chapter details the tasks you need to complete
              or consider before attempting to install the OSI
              applications.

        10.1 Inspecting the Distribution Kit

              The software bill of materials (BOM) included with your
              distribution kit shows the components of the kit. Compare
              the items you received against the BOM. Report any damaged
              or missing components to DIGITAL before continuing with the
              installation.

        10.2 Logging In to a Privileged Account

              To install the OSI applications, you must be logged in to
              an account that has the following privileges:

              For FTAM and VT:

              o  SETPRV

              For OSAK:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  SETPRV

              Determine your account privileges as follows:

              1. Determine the default privileges of the installing
                 account. Log in and enter the DCL command:

              2. Do either of the following:

                 o  Ask your system manager to use the Authorize utility
                    to modify the default privileges of the account to
                    include the SETPRV privilege

                 o  Run the Authorize utility and make the changes
                    yourself, if your account has the SYSPRV privilege:

                    $ set default sys$system <Return>
                    $ run authorize <Return>
                    UAF> modify account-name/privileges=(SETPRV) <Return>
                    UAF> exit <Return>

              3. To activate the change in privileges, log out and then
                 log in again.

        10.3 Accessing the Online Release Notes

              The release notes for the OSI applications are provided
              as part of the DECnet-Plus release notes. You should
              review these release notes prior to installation because
              they describe new features and differences among multiple
              versions, as well as changes to the installation procedure.

              To access the release notes, issue the command:

              $ product extract release_notes -
                  decnet_osi/source=DKA400:[kits]/file=filename <Return>

              Note that in this example, the directory on the CD in
              which the installation kit is located is referred to as
              DKA400:[kits]. You should substitute this directory name
              with the actual directory location of your DECnet-Plus kit.

              The product selected is displayed and you are prompted
              whether to continue with the extraction.

              To extract the release notes, type YES and press Return.
              The release notes are written to the specified file, which
              you can display or print.

              To cancel the extraction, type NO and press Return.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                After DECnet-Plus is installed, the release notes file
                is located in:

        10.4 Memory Requirements

              To install and run the OSI applications, you must have
              sufficient free global memory. Table 10-1 shows the global
              memory requirements:

              Table 10-1 Required Global Pages, Global Pagelets and

              _________6_global_sections___13_global_sections____________

              You must first find out your available system resources,
              and then use the AUTOGEN utility if you need to increase
              the global pages, global pagelets, or global sections
              system parameters. Do this as follows:

              1. Use the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical function
                 to find the number of free global pages and global
                 sections. The following example shows how to get
                 this information at your terminal (the default for
                 SYS$OUTPUT):

                 $ write sys$output f$getsyi("contig_gblpages") <Return>
                 15848
                 $ write sys$output f$getsyi("free_gblsects") <Return>

        10.4 Memory Requirements


              2. Compare the values displayed with those required for the
                 OSI applications.

                 o  If the values displayed by the system are greater
                    than the values required for the OSI applications,
                    you do not need to change the system parameter
                    settings.

                 o  If one of the values is less than the value required
                    for OSI applications, you must increase the system
                    parameter setting using the AUTOGEN utility. Proceed
                    to the next section.

        10.4.1 Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN

              Use the AUTOGEN command procedure to change system
              parameters. AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for
              parameters that are associated with the values you reset
              manually.

              For more information about using the AUTOGEN utility, refer
              to your OpenVMS system management documentation.

        10.5 Process Quotas

              The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility requires that
              the installation account has as a minimum the quotas shown
              in Table 10-2.

              The number of available global sections on the system
              limits the number of simultaneous connect requests that
              the OSAK software can support. OSAK buffers store each
              connect request in a global section until the intended
              application has either accepted or rejected it, or does

              not accept an inbound connection within a given period,
              in which case the OSAK software rejects the connection
              on behalf of the application. The process running the
              OSAK software, OSAK$SERVER_V3, is started automatically
              by the installation procedure. Therefore, the installing
              account requires the process quotas shown in Table 10-2,
              as does the SYSTEM account if you start OSAK$SERVER_V3 in
              SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.

              Table 10-3 summarizes the required process account quotas
              for the OSAK$SERVER_V3 process.

              OSAK$SERVER_V3 Process Account Calculation Example

              The following calculations determine the correct process
              account quota values for 20 global sections:

              o  For ASTLM: 20 global sections multiplied by 2 units + 10
                 = 50

              o  For TQELM: 20 global sections multiplied by 2 units + 10
                 = 50

              Table 10-4 summarizes the minimum process account quotas
              required for processes that use the OSAK software.

              Use the OpenVMS Authorize utility to verify and change
              process quotas and user privileges for the installation and
              user accounts in the user authorization file (SYSUAF.DAT).
              (Some sites may restrict the use of the OpenVMS Authorize
              utility to certain accounts or users.)

              After you have changed the quotas for the installation
              account, log out of the installation account and log in
              again for the new quotas to take effect.

              For more information on modifying account quotas, refer
              to the description of the Authorize utility in the OpenVMS
              system management documentation subkit.

        10.6 Determining Disk Space

              Table 10-5 shows the approximate minimum disk space
              required to install the individual OSI applications.

              To determine the number of free disk blocks on the current
              system disk, enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

              $ show device sys$sysdevice <Return>

              If necessary, create enough free disk space to accommodate
              the installation of the OSI applications.

              Chapter 7 describes options the POLYCENTER Software
              Installation utility provides, if there is insufficient
              disk space to complete the OSI applications installation.

        10.7 Notifying Users

              You may want to notify the users on the system that you are
              installing the OSI applications. Log in to an account that
              has OPER privileges.

              The command is:

                                          Installing the OSI Applications


              This chapter describes how to install the optional OSI
              applications. These applications are:

              o  FTAM

              o  Virtual Terminal (VT)

              o  OSAK

              It also includes how to list the files installed on your
              system during the OSI applications installation. See
              Section 11.11 for the list of commands.

              You install these optional components using the POLYCENTER
              Software Installation utility. For information about how
              to run the this utility, refer to <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_
              INSTALL_BASIC), Appendix A.

        11.1 Prerequisite Steps

              Install the OSI applications only after you have installed
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS, rebooted, and configured the
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS base components.

        11.2 Register the OSI Applications Software License

              If you are installing prerequisite or optional software
              along with OSI applications, review the PAK status and
              install the PAKs for any prerequisite or optional software
              before you install the OSI applications.

              The DVNETEND PAK is required to install DECnet-Plus. This
              PAK also allows you to install and run the base FTAM, VT,
              and OSAK applications.

              To use the FTAM and VT gateways, you need the extended
              function license. The PAK names are:

              o  For Alpha: DVNETEXT

              o  For VAX: DVNETRTG

        11.3 Starting the Installation of the OSI Applications

              You install the OSI applications using the POLYCENTER
              Software Installation DCL interface.

              For a description of all the features you can request when
              starting an installation (such as purging files and using
              a product configuration file), refer to DCL help for the
              product install command.

              To install the OSI applications, choose from the following
              commands.

              For OSAK only:

              $ product install osak /source=DKA400:[kits]

              For FTAM and VT:

              $ product install ftam,vt /source=DKA400:[kits]

              For FTAM only:

              $ product install ftam /source=DKA400:[kits]

              For VT only:

              $ product install vt /source=DKA400:[kits]

              If you do not use the /SOURCE qualifier, the default is to
              read the installation kit from PCSI$SOURCE:.

              Note that in the above example, the directory on the CD
              in which the installation kit is located is referred to as
              DKA400:[kits]. You should replace this directory name with
              your actual directory location of the OSI applications kit.

              Details on determining the directory location of the OSI
              applications kit are provided in Section 9.4.

        11.4 Installing the OSI Applications

              To install the OSI applications, log into the SYSTEM
              account and perform the following steps:

              1. If you have previously installed the OSI applications on
                 your system, be sure to shut down any FTAM, VT, or OSAK
                 processes currently running by executing the appropriate
                 shutdown procedures(s).

                 You must shut down FTAM and VT first, before shutting
                 down OSAK.

                 o  $ @sys$startup:osif$stop

                 o  $ @sys$startup:vt_stop

                 o  $ @sys$startup:osak$stop

              2. De-install the OSI applications.

                 If you have previously installed the OSI applications on
                 your system, then de-install the applications, using the
                 product remove command:

                 $ product remove application <Return>

                 application is FTAM, VT, or OSAK.

                 Note that you must de-install FTAM and VT before de-
                 installing OSAK.

              3. Mount the software CD-ROM.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Refer to the OpenVMS Layered Products Compact Disc
                User's Guide for instructions on mounting and removing
                a compact disc.

                ______________________________________________________

              4. Decide which products to install. You must install OSAK
                 before installing FTAM or VT. You can install FTAM and
                 VT either together or separately.

                 See Section 11.3 for the FTAM, VT, and OSAK installation
                 commands.

              5. To install FTAM and VT together, type:

                 $ product install ftam,vt/source=device:[directory] <Return>

                 device:[directory] is the location of the files on the
                 distribution media.

        11.5 Starting Up and Shutting Down OSI Applications

              The installation procedure for each OSI application
              executes the startup procedure automatically.

              To enable automatic restart of the applications once you
              have installed them on your system, edit the system startup
              file (sys$manager:systartup_vms.com) and add the following
              command lines to the file, beginning with the OSAK command:

              $ @sys$startup:osak$start.com ! OSAK startup command file
              $ @sys$startup:osif$startup.com ! FTAM startup command file
              $ @sys$startup:vt_start.com ! VT startup command file

              See Section 11.4, Step 1, for instructions on shutting down
              the OSI applications.

        11.6 The OSAK Installation Verification Procedure

              The OSAK installation verification procedure (IVP) is run
              automatically during the installation. However, you can run
              it at any time by entering the following command:

              $ @sys$test:osak_ivp

              If the IVP runs successfully, you see the following:

              Starting OSAK Installation Verification Procedure ...
              OSAK Installation Verification Procedure completed successfully

                        11.6 The OSAK Installation Verification Procedure


              If the IVP finishes with errors, you see a message similar
              to this:

              OSAK Installation Verification Procedure completed with errors

              In both cases, the OSAK software produces a log file called
              OSAK$IVP.LOG in the default directory, SYS$TEST. If the
              IVP fails during installation, you can check the log file
              to help you identify the source of the problem. You can
              also forward the log file to DIGITAL to assist you when
              discussing the problem.

              When you have finished running the IVP and you are sure
              that the OSAK software is properly installed, back up
              the system disk. Save the distribution kit for future
              installations.

        11.7 Running the OSIF$CONFIGURE.COM Procedure

              Following the FTAM POLYCENTER Software Installation utility
              installation, you should execute the osif$configure.com
              procedure located in SYS$STARTUP. This procedure
              first verifies the existence of the OSIT$DEFAULT and
              OSIGTWY accounts, then asks whether you want to run the
              installation verification procedure (IVP).

              If the procedure finds that either of the OSIT$DEFAULT and
              OSIGTWY accounts are not present, the procedure creates the
              account(s) and prompts for user input. The IVP question is
              asked whether or not it was necessary to create accounts.

              Following is an example of running the script on a system
              where the accounts already exist:

              $ @sys$startup:osif$configure.com
                This setup procedure will verify the existence of the OSIT$DEFAULT
                and OSIGTWY accounts.  If these accounts are not present, you will
                be asked some questions about UIC and default device, as well as
                being required to choose passwords from a computer generated list.

                Do you wish to continue with this procedure [Yes] :

                The OSIT$DEFAULT and OSIGTWY accounts are present.  The OSIT$DEFAULT
                account is useful as an account to specify when running the DECnet-Plus
                FTAM IVP.  The OSIGTWY account is the mechanism by which users may access
                the DAP/FTAM Gateway.  For more information about this Gateway, see the
                FTAM Use and Management Guide.

        11.8 The FTAM Installation Verification Procedure

              You can verify the FTAM installation by running the FTAM
              installation verification procedure (IVP). The IVP is an
              internal test of the FTAM initiator and responder using
              the underlying OSI layers of the local system through the
              Network layer. This testing verifies that your installation
              can set up and accept an application association and its
              underlying presentation and session connections. The IVP
              tests the FTAM DCL commands on the local system and also
              exercises the DAP-FTAM Gateway.

              The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility does not
              automatically run the IVP. You must do this manually.

              The DCL commands tested by the IVP are:

              o  COPY/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM

              o  DIRECTORY/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM

              o  DELETE/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM

              o  RENAME/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM

        11.8.1 Preparing for the FTAM IVP

              Before you run the IVP:

              1. Ensure that the OSI transport is running and enabled.
                 It will be running if you answered YES to the "Configure
                 Transport?" question during the net$configure procedure.

              2. If you are running the IVP for the first time, be sure
                 to run the OSIF$CONFIGURE.COM beforehand. Instructions
                 on running this procedure are in Section 11.7. The last
                 question in the procedure asks if you want to run the
                 IVP. To do so, type YES and press <Return>.

        11.8.2 Running the FTAM IVP

              You can issue the IVP commands from any directory on
              the system. The IVP prompts you for an account and the
              corresponding password. The OSIT$DEFAULT account is a
              reasonable choice since it will be configured correctly.
              However, you may specify any valid account and password.

              $ @sys$test:osif$ivp.com

                DECnet-Plus FTAM Installation Verification Procedure

                It is 20-APR-1995 at 10:50.

                The DECnet-Plus FTAM IVP assigns the LOCAL_FTAM alias to be:

                        :::RMS.FTAM.OSIF.%x21,template=osit$loop_clns:

                The DECnet-Plus FTAM IVP copies a small data file, SYS$TEST:OSIF$IVP.TMP,
                to LOCAL_FTAM::OSIFILE.TMP. The IVP requests a directory listing
                of the new file, before copying it back to SYS$LOGIN:OSIF$IVP.CPY.
                Next, the IVP requests a difference of the original file,
                SYS$TEST:OSIF$IVP.TMP, and the second new file, SYS$LOGIN:OSIF$IVP.CPY.
                The LOCAL_FTAM::OSIFILE.TMP file, that was originally copied is then
                renamed to LOCAL_FTAM::OSIFILE.RNM. The IVP then deletes the two
                new files.

                To perform these actions, a valid username and password with
                the following privileges must be supplied by the user:

                        NETMBX, TMPMBX, SYSNAM, SYSLCK, PRMMBX

              Please enter the USERNAME for use by the IVP: osit$default

              $ @sys$test:vt_ivp

              If the IVP ran successfully, you see the following:

              VT_IVP: Test successful

              %IVP-S-END, IVP ended

              If the IVP finishes with errors, you see a message similar
              to this:

              VT_IVP: <Failure message>

              %IVP-S-END, IVP ended

              In both cases, the VT software produces a log file called
              VT_IVP.LOG in the SYS$SCRATCH directory. You can check the
              log file to help you identify the source of the problem.
              You can also forward the log file to DIGITAL to assist you
              when discussing the problem.

        11.10 De-installing OSI Applications

              To de-install the OSI applications, you must be logged into
              an account with the same privileges required to install
              the OSI applications. See Section 10.2 for this list of
              privileges.

              You may optionally shut down the OSI applications before
              de-installing them. See Section 11.4 for instructions.

        11.10 De-installing OSI Applications


              Note that you must de-install FTAM and VT before you de-
              install OSAK.

              To de-install any of the OSI applications, enter the
              command:

              $ product remove application

              application is FTAM, VT, or OSAK.

              Invoking this command shuts down the application if it is
              running and removes the product files. An example of the
              de-installation response sequence for each application is
              provided in Section 11.13.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                You do not have to remove a product before re-
                installing the same version, or installing a different
                version. If the product is already installed on
                the system, the POLYCENTER Software Installation
                utility removes it automatically before beginning
                the installation.

                ______________________________________________________

        11.11 Files Installed on Your System

              The OSI applications installation procedure installs a
              number of files on your system. To list the files, enter
              the following command:

              $ product show object /product=application

              application is FTAM, VT, or OSAK.

                                         Configuring the OSI Applications


              This chapter describes how to configure FTAM and Virtual
              Terminal (VT) on an OpenVMS system.

        12.1 FTAM and Virtual Terminal Terminology

              o  An initiator, or client, is the program on one system
                 that initiates a request to a program on another system,
                 and awaits a response.

              o  A responder, or server, is the program on a system
                 providing a response to a request initiated on another
                 system.

              o  A listener is a job running on the responding system
                 that fulfills incoming requests from an initiating
                 system.

        12.2 About the OSI Application Entity Database

              The FTAM and VT applications require you to manage the
              OSI application entity database. This database stores
              addressing information for aliases that represent FTAM
              and VT applications and listeners.

              On OpenVMS, the location of this file is:

              sys$system:isoapplications.dat

              The entries in the isoapplications database define aliases
              and contain information about local listeners, remote
              responders, and source addresses for local initiators.
              The aliases are used by local FTAM and VT initiators and
              listeners, and by users who specify these aliases in FTAM
              and VT commands.

        Configuring the OSI Applications
        12.2 About the OSI Application Entity Database


              There are three types of formats you can use in this
              isoapplications database. They are:

              o  Address - Information on local listeners, remote
                 applications, and local initiator source address.

              o  Distinguished Name - X.500 Directory Service fixed
                 entries.

              o  Pattern - X.500 Directory Service variable entries.

              The isoapplications database can contain any combination of
              these formats.

              For detailed information on the Address, Distinguished
              Name and Pattern formats, refer to Chapter 9 in
              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_FTAM_VT_MGMT).

        12.3 Getting Started Configuring Initiating and Responding
             Entities

              This section provides basic configuration task checklist
              items and examples for setting up the initiating and
              responding systems or entities.

              Refer to <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_FTAM_VT_MGMT) for detailed
              information about managing initiating and responding
              systems.

              If you are already familiar with configuring FTAM and VT,
              then you can continue the configuration procedure starting
              at Section 12.4.

        12.3.1 Setting Up Responding Entities

              On OpenVMS, the FTAM and VT installation and startup
              procedures provide default FTAM and VT responders. When
              the vt_start.com and osif$startup.com command procedures
              are run, these responders are started automatically.

        12.3.2 Setting Up Initiating Entities

              A responding entity needs to be defined in the
              isoapplications database before you can access it. To get
              the information you need for an alias, you must contact
              the person responsible for configuring and managing the
              remote OSI system running FTAM or VT. The remote FTAM or VT
              implementation may be from DIGITAL or from another vendor.

      12.3 Getting Started Configuring Initiating and Responding Entities


              Set up the isoapplications database for a specific remote
              FTAM or VT application as follows:

              1. Determine the available transports between your DIGITAL
                 system and the remote OSI system and select one.

              2. Collect the information needed to define an alias.
                 Complete the Address Format Worksheet Form shown in
                 Table 12-3 as follows:

                 a. Choose an alias name for the remote responder. This
                    name is local to your system and can be any name you
                    choose.

                 b. Specify whether the remote application is FTAM or VT.

                 c. Obtain the AP-title and the AE-qualifier that the
                    remote application requires, if any. If they are not
                    required, leave these fields blank.

                 d. Obtain the SAP selectors (PSEL, SSEL, TSEL) that the
                    remote application requires.

                 e. Obtain the NSAP of the remote application. The format
                    of this field depends upon which transport provider
                    you are using.

                    o  For OSI transport: Obtain the remote NSAP.

                    o  For RFC 1006: Obtain the remote Internet address
                       and RFC 1006 daemon port.

                    o  For CONS over X.25: Obtain the remote X.25 NSAP.

                 f. Specify the transport provider you selected in step
                    1.

                 g. Determine the local transport template you want to
                    use.

                    o  For OSI transport: Default template is default.

                    o  For RFC 1006: Default template is osit$rfc1006.

                    o  For CONS over X.25: Use a CONS template.

              3. Define the alias in isoapplications in Address format
                 with the information you collected in the prior steps.
                 You can edit this database using a text editor.

              Once the setup is complete, you can invoke initiator
              requests using the alias.

        Configuring the OSI Applications
        12.3 Getting Started Configuring Initiating and Responding Entities


        12.3.3 Example: Performing An FTAM File Copy

              Use the task list from Section 12.3.2 to configure your
              system to perform an FTAM file copy.

              In this example, you copy remote file system_a_filename on
              System-A, to file system_b_filename on System-B.

              System-A is the responding entity, and System-B is the
              initiating entity. System-A and System-B are OpenVMS
              systems.

              Use the OSI provider and the following account information
              on System-A:

              username: system_a_user <Return>
              password: system_a_pwd <Return>

              Use the default FTAM responder on System-A. There is no
              setup required on System-A.

              Using information collected in Section 12.3.2, perform
              the following steps on initiating entity System-B from a
              privileged account:

              1. Determine available transports and choose one. For this
                 example, use OSI transport.

              2. Perform the following steps:

                 a. Choose an alias. For this example, use system_a_
                    alias.

                 b. Specify FTAM or VT. For this example, the remote
                    application is FTAM.

                 c. Obtain the AP-title and AE-qualifier. For this
                    example, the responder does not require this
                    information.

                 d. Obtain the SAP selectors. The FTAM responder on
                    OpenVMS uses RMS.FTAM.OSIF.

                 e. Obtain the remote NSAP. For this example,
                    the responder's OSI transport NSAP is
                    %X410004AA000400001321.

                 f. Specify transport provider. For this example, use
                    OSI. Note that because OSI is the default provider,
                    you can omit it for this example.

      12.3 Getting Started Configuring Initiating and Responding Entities


                 g. Determine the transport template. For this example,
                    use default. Note that because default is the default
                    template, you can omit it for this example.

              3. Define the alias in isoapplications:

                 system_a_alias  :FTAM:::RMS.FTAM.OSIF. \
                                         %X410004AA000400001321, \
                                         provider=osi,template=default:

              After the setup is complete, you can start the FTAM copy
              command:

              $ copy/application=ftam - <Return>
              system_a_alias"system_a_user system_a_pwd"::system_a_filename - <Return>
              system_b_filename <Return>

        12.3.4 Example: Performing A Virtual Terminal Login

              Use the task list from Section 12.3.2 to configure your
              system to perform a Virtual Terminal login.

              In this example, you perform a VT set host/vtp from System-
              B to System-A.

              System-A is the responding entity, and System-B is the
              initiating entity. System-A and System-B are OpenVMS
              systems.

              Use the RFC 1006 provider and the following account
              information from System-A:

              username: system_a_user <Return>
              password: system_a_pwd <Return>

              Use the default VT responder on responding entity System-A.
              There is no setup required on System-A.

              Using the information from Section 12.3.2, perform the
              following steps on initiating entity System-B from a
              privileged account:

              1. Determine available transports and choose one. For this
                 example, use RFC 1006.

              2. Perform the following steps:

                 a. Choose an alias. For this example, use system_a_
                    alias.

        Configuring the OSI Applications
        12.3 Getting Started Configuring Initiating and Responding Entities


                 b. Specify FTAM or VT. For this example, the remote
                    application is VT.

                 c. Obtain the AP-title and AE-qualifier. For this
                    example, the responder does not require this
                    information.

                 d. Obtain the SAP selectors. The VT responder on OpenVMS
                    uses %x0001.%x0001.%x0002.

                 e. Obtain the remote NSAP. For this example, the
                    responder's RFC 1006 internet address is 16.20.8.42
                    and the daemon port is 102.

                 f. Specify transport provider. For this example, use RFC
                    1006.

                 g. Determine the transport template. For this example,
                    use osit$rfc1006. Note that because osit$rfc1006
                    is the default template, you can omit it for this
                    example.

              3. Define the alias in isoapplications:

                 system_a_alias  :VT:::%x0001.%x0001.%x0002. \
                                        16.20.8.42.102, \
                                        provider=rfc1006:

              After the setup is complete, you can start the VT set
              host/vtp command:

              $ set host/vtp system_a_alias  <Return>

              Username:  SYSTEM_A_USER  <Return>
              Password:  system_a_pwd  <Return>

        12.4 About Responding Entities

              As stated in Section 12.3.1, default FTAM and VT responders
              are provided on OpenVMS. The installation also supplies an
              initial isoapplications file with local aliases used by the
              FTAM and VT responders, gateways, and initiators.

              Table 12-1 shows default addresses (PSEL, SSEL, TSEL) for
              the FTAM and VT responders and gateways:

              VT/LAT Gateway          %x0001.%x0001.%x0003

              VT/TELNET_Gateway_______%x0001.%x0001.%x0004_______________

              Each of these responders and gateways can accept
              connections through all of the transports that FTAM and
              VT support: OSI transport, RFC 1006, and X.25/CONS.

              You can set up your own responder for FTAM in addition to
              or instead of the default one. You cannot set up your own
              responder for VT; however, you can change the aliases and
              change the local addresses (PSEL, SSEL, TSEL) that the VT
              responder and gateways use. For these operations, refer to
              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_FTAM_VT_MGMT), Chapter 10 and Chapter
              11.

        12.5 Configuring Addresses for Remote FTAM and VT Applications

              The primary job of configuring FTAM and VT on OpenVMS is to
              add entries to the isoapplications database for the remote
              FTAM and VT applications on your network. On OpenVMS, you
              add entries to isoapplications by using a text editor.

              Refer to Chapter 9 in <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_FTAM_VT_MGMT)
              for a complete description of managing the isoapplications
              database.

              As mentioned in Section 12.2, every entry in
              isoapplications has one of three formats:

              o  Address format

              o  Distinguished Name format

              o  Pattern format

              If you have the DEC X.500 Directory Service product
              installed, you have the option of adding entries of the
              Distinguished Name format and the Pattern format. You
              have the option of adding entries of the Address format
              regardless of whether X.500 is installed.

        Configuring the OSI Applications
        12.5 Configuring Addresses for Remote FTAM and VT Applications


        12.5.1 Adding Address Format Entries

              Refer to Section 9.2.1 in <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_FTAM_VT_MGMT)
              for a complete description of Address format entries.
              Entries of the Address format take the following form:

              alias   :application:ap-title:ae-qualifier:psel.ssel.tsel.
                                                         nsap,transport_options;
                                                         nsap,transport_options; ...
                                                         nsap,transport_options:

              Use the information you completed in the Address Format
              Worksheet to add the Address format entries. For example,
              an Address format entry for VT could look like the
              following:

              remote1 :VT:::psap.ssap.tsap.%x4145418715004108002B23569821, \
                                           provider=osi,template=default:

              Note that you can enter more than one NSAP per alias.

        12.5.2 Adding Distinguished Name Format Entries

              Refer to Section 9.2.2 in <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_FTAM_VT_MGMT)
              for a complete description of Distinguished Name entries.
              Entries of the Distinguished Name format take the following
              form:

              alias   :application:template_list:x500_distinguished_name:

              Use the information you completed in the configuration
              checklist to add the Distinguished Name format entries. For
              example, a Distinguished Name format entry for FTAM could
              look like the following:

              remote2 :FTAM:template=default:/c=us/o=org/ou=org_unit/cn=remote2/cn=ftam:

        12.5.3 Adding Pattern Format Entries

              Refer to Section 9.2.3 in <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_FTAM_VT_MGMT)
              for a complete description of Pattern format entries.
              Entries of the Pattern format take the following form:

              *   :application:template_list:incomplete_distinguished_name:

              You need only one Pattern format entry in isoapplications
              for each application (FTAM or VT). Use the information you
              completed in the configuration checklist to add the Pattern
              format entries.

           12.5 Configuring Addresses for Remote FTAM and VT Applications


              For example, the aliases passed to the FTAM and VT
              commands could correspond to the value of the common name
              attribute of the application process entries in the X.500
              directory. In this case, you might use the following two
              isoapplications entries:

              *   :VT:template=default:/c=us/o=org/ou=org_unit/cn=*/cn=vt:
              *   :FTAM:template=default:/c=us/o=org/ou=org_unit/cn=*/cn=ftam:

        12.6 Registering Responders To X.500 Directory

              If you have DEC X.500 Directory Service available to you,
              you have the option of storing the addresses of the local
              FTAM and VT responders in the X.500 Directory database.
              Use the information you completed in the configuration
              checklist to register your local responders.

              For example, you could use the following DEC X.500
              Administration Facility (DXIM) command to register your
              local FTAM responder on node srchr, assuming that srchr
              already exists in the database as an application process.

                                     Configuring Asynchronous Connections


              This appendix describes how to configure asynchronous
              connections, which give you the option of connecting your
              OpenVMS system to another system by means of a low-cost,
              low-speed asynchronous line. Asynchronous connections are
              implemented in software and can be run over any directly
              connected terminal line that the OpenVMS system supports.

              The asynchronous protocol provides for a full-duplex
              connection and can be used for remote asynchronous
              communications over a telephone line using a modem.
              Asynchronous connections are not supported for maintenance
              operations or for controller loopback testing.

        A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections

              Normally, the OpenVMS system controls lines connected to
              terminal ports, as in interactive logins. You can, however,
              switch the line so the DECnet-Plus software can use the
              line for an asynchronous connection to another system. You
              can establish two types of asynchronous DECnet connections:

              o  A static asynchronous connection, which creates a
                 permanent DECnet link to a single remote node. Two nodes
                 are connected by either a dialup line or by a physical
                 line attached to a terminal port at each end. Before
                 the DECnet connection is made, the terminal lines must
                 be converted to static asynchronous DDCMP lines. (See
                 Section A.1.1.)

              o  A dynamic asynchronous connection, which provides a
                 temporary DECnet link. A dynamic asynchronous line
                 is normally switched on for network use only for the
                 duration of a dialup connection between two nodes.
                 When the telephone is hung up, the line reverts to
                 being a terminal line. You can establish dynamic

                 connections to different remote nodes at different
                 times. When using a dynamic connection, you can have
                 the terminal line switched automatically to a DECnet
                 line, or you can switch it to a DECnet line manually.
                 (See Section A.1.2.)

              The asynchronous software is optional. You can load
              and configure it by using the net$configure.com,
              net$startup.com, and wandd$startup.com procedures.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The net$configure.com, net$startup.com, and
                wandd$startup.com procedures automatically set up
                static asynchronous connections for you.

                The information in Section A.1.1 is necessary only
                if you want to set up a configuration outside of the
                configuration provided by the procedures.

                The net$configure.com, net$startup.com, and
                wandd$startup.com procedures load all the necessary
                images and NCL files to preconfigure your system for
                dynamic asynchronous connections. The user making the
                dynamic connection needs only to log in and invoke the
                dynamic switch.

                Most of the information in Section A.1.2 is necessary
                only if you want to set up a configuration outside
                of the configuration provided by the procedures.
                Section A.1.2.2 provides information about the dynamic
                switch.

                ______________________________________________________

              The asynchronous software consists of three pieces:

              o  asydriver

              o  asyswitch

              o  asydynswitch

              To switch a terminal line to a DECnet line or a DECnet line
              back to a terminal line, you use DCL set commands such as
              the following:

              o  To switch a DECnet line back to ttdriver:

                 $ set terminal/nonetwork terminal-port

              o  To switch a terminal line to a static asynchronous line
                 (asydriver):

                 $ set terminal/network terminal-port

              o  To switch a terminal line to a dynamic asynchronous line
                 (asydriver):

                 $ set terminal/network/switch=decnet

        Configuring Asynchronous Connections
        A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


              o  To switch a terminal line to a dynamic manual
                 asynchronous line (asydriver):

                 $ set terminal/network/switch=decnet/manual

              Switching the line is only one step in setting up
              asynchronous communications. You must also configure your
              DECnet lines, links, and circuits. Setting up a link and
              circuit for asynchronous connections is the same as when
              you set up a synchronous link and circuit. The difference
              occurs when you configure your line in the Modem Connect
              module. The communications port attribute for the modem
              connect line has special significance.

              To set up a dynamic asynchronous connection, you need to
              preconfigure the protocol stack. This means that you need
              to map a routing circuit to a DDCMP logical station. The
              logical station, in turn, uses a line created with the
              Modem Connect module that specifies a communications port
              with either a "floating" line or an explicit line for your
              dynamic connection. A "floating" line is not tied to a
              specific terminal device, while an explicit line is tied
              to a specific device. You must configure the protocol stack
              (at both ends of the link when using two DECnet-Plus for
              OpenVMS systems) before you set host to the remote system
              and switch the dynamic asynchronous line into operation.

                                      A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Non OpenVMS systems that support OSI standards can
                make asynchronous DECnet-Plus connections to OpenVMS
                systems. The asynchronous connection can be between
                two routers, a router and an end node, or two end
                nodes.

                ______________________________________________________

        A.1.1 Establishing a Static Asynchronous Connection

              A static asynchronous DECnet connection is a permanent
              connection between two nodes. This type of connection can
              be made in one of two ways:

              o  The nodes can be connected by a physical line (a null
                 modem cable) attached to a terminal port at each system.
                 No modems are required. You can communicate with the
                 other system at any time.

              o  The connection can be made over a dialup line using
                 modems at both ends of the line. For example, your
                 OpenVMS system can establish a static asynchronous
                 connection to a remote node over a telephone line.

              Follow the steps outlined in this section to manually
              establish a static asynchronous connection. For the
              connection to be successful, the node with which you are
              creating a DECnet link must also establish an asynchronous
              DECnet connection with your node. (The line speeds at each
              end of the connection must be the same.)

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you use the net$configure.com procedure to
                set up your static asynchronous lines, then the
                net$startup.com and wandd$startup.com procedures load
                asydriver and configure the lines for you.

                ______________________________________________________

              1. Log in to the SYSTEM account on your OpenVMS system.

              2. DECnet must be running on both nodes for the remaining
                 steps. If not already done, you and the remote system
                 manager must start up the network by entering the
                 following command:

        Configuring Asynchronous Connections
        A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


                 $ @sys$startup:net$startup

              3. Load the asynchronous driver, asydriver.

                 Enter the following commands at your terminal (or
                 include them in the sys$manager:systartup_vms.com
                 command procedure before you boot the system):

                 $ run sys$system:sysgen
                 SYSGEN> connect asy0/noadapter/driver=asydriver
                 SYSGEN> exit

                 The asynchronous driver must be loaded before any
                 asynchronous connection can be made.

              4. Next, install the asynchronous shareable images required
                 for a static asynchronous connection. Use the following
                 command:

                 $ install add sys$library:asyswitch.exe/open/head/share

              5. To change a terminal line into a static asynchronous
                 DECnet line, use the DCL command set terminal terminal-
                 port-name with the appropriate qualifiers, where
                 terminal-port-name represents the device where you want
                 to connect the static asynchronous DECnet line (see
                 examples a and b.) If you have more than one terminal
                 attached to your OpenVMS system, you must specify a
                 set terminal command for each terminal line used for a
                 static asynchronous DECnet connection.

                 a. Nondialup line: The following command converts the
                    terminal line connected to the port into a DECnet
                    line with no modem control:

                    $ set terminal/permanent/nomodem/notype_ahead -
                    _$ /network terminal-port-name

                    The terminal-port-name, for instance, could be tta0.

                 b. Dialup line: The following command converts the
                    terminal line connected to the port (which can be
                    used as a dialup line) into a DECnet line with modem
                    control:

                    $ set terminal/permanent/notype_ahead/network/modem -
                    _$ /noautobaud/nohangup terminal-port-name

                    The terminal-port-name, for instance, could be ttb0.

                 You can change the line speed by resetting the line
                 to non-network mode with the set terminal/nonetwork
                 command. After you do this, switch the line back to
                 network mode with the set terminal/network command. You
                 cannot use the set command to change the line speed or
                 any other parameters while the line is in network mode.

                 You can ensure that these set terminal commands execute
                 automatically each time the network is started in
                 the future. Modify your sys$manager:systartup_vms.com
                 command procedure to include all required set terminal
                 commands after the network starts up but before
                 executing the commands in the next step that configure
                 the modem connect line.

              6. Next, configure your line. If the configuration
                 procedures have not already created the Modem Connect
                 module, create it manually before configuring the line.
                 Use the following example to set up the necessary modem
                 connect entities.

                 $ run sys$system:ncl

                 ncl> create modem connect line static_asynch -
                 _ncl> communications port async_port_name 1

                 ncl> set modem connect line static_asynch speed 2400 2

                 ncl> enable modem connect line static_asynch

                 1  For an asynchronous line or circuit, the
                    communications port attribute, (async_port_name),
                    has one of two formats:

                    o  devcu as in txa0:

                    o  dev-c-u as in tx-0-0

                    where dev-c-u is defined as follows:

                    dev  The first two letters of the asynchronous device
                         name (possible values are tt and tx).

                    c    A decimal number (0 or a positive integer)
                         designating a device's hardware controller.
                         If the third letter of the device name is A, c
                         equals 0. If the third letter of the device name
                         is B, c equals 1, and so on.

                    u    The unit number of the device name; u is always
                         equal to 0 or a positive integer.

                    For example, dev-c-u would be tx-0-0 for unit txa0:.

                 2  The line speeds at both sides of the connection
                    should be the same.

              7. Next, configure your data link and routing circuit. For
                 information about configuring your data link and routing
                 circuit, see the chapters on managing network security
                 and network management tasks in <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_
                 NET_MGMT).

              8. For security over a dialup connection, run NCL and
                 establish optional routing initialization passwords.
                 For more information about using verifiers, refer to the
                 <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_NET_MGMT) guide.

        A.1.1.1 Terminating a Static Asynchronous Connection

              Use the following steps to terminate a static asynchronous
              connection:

              1. Use NCL to disable (turn off) and delete the routing
                 circuit and the static asynchronous line, as follows:

                 $ run sys$system:ncl

                 ncl> disable modem connect line static_asynch

                 ncl> disable ddcmp link static_asynch -
                 _ncl> logical station static_asynch

                 ncl> disable ddcmp link static_asynch

                 ncl> disable routing circuit static_asynch

                 ncl> delete modem connect line static_asynch

                 ncl> delete ddcmp link static_asynch -
                 _ncl> logical station static_asynch

                 ncl> delete ddcmp link static_asynch

                 ncl> delete routing circuit static_asynch
                 ncl> exit

              2. The following command switches your asynchronous line
                 back to a terminal line:

                 $ set terminal/permanent/nonetwork/typeahead terminal_port_name

        A.1.1.2 Reasons for Failure of Static Asynchronous Connections

              If the initial set terminal command fails, check that:

              o  WANDD started up.

              o  The asydriver loaded (the asy0 device must be present).

              o  The asyswitch installed.

              If the logical station is in the on-starting state, check
              that:

              o  The line speeds at both ends of the connection are set
                 to the same value.

              o  The modem control characteristic of the modem connect
                 line at both ends of the link are the same.

              o  The routing circuits configured correctly.

              o  The parity is correct. Asynchronous DECnet requires the
                 parity on the asynchronous line be set to none and the
                 terminal line be set to use 8-bit characters. If you
                 are using a system other than OpenVMS, the terminal line
                 must be set to the correct parity.

              If your terminal line cannot be set up as a static
              asynchronous DDCMP line, check whether the following
              condition exists:

              o  If data is stored in a type-ahead buffer, the line
                 appears as a terminal line even if a startup command
                 procedure attempts to set it up as a DDCMP line. This
                 generally occurs when the remote node is running and its
                 asynchronous DDCMP line is on. The DDCMP start messages
                 being transmitted are stored in the type-ahead buffer
                 associated with your terminal line. Before you can start
                 up your line in DDCMP mode, terminate the process that
                 owns your terminal line.

              To verify that the asynchronous line is connected properly,
              check the following:

              o  For local connections, verify that the cable is a null
                 modem cable.

        Configuring Asynchronous Connections
        A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


              o  For modem connections, verify that the cable is a
                 straight-through cable and that if the modem is put
                 in analog loopback, the circuit comes up with the local
                 node as the adjacent node.

              o  For both types of connections, verify that the port
                 is operational by resetting it to terminal-type
                 characteristics and plugging in a terminal and logging
                 in.

              If your connection is timing out or losing DDCMP packets,
              you might not have a sufficient number of receive buffers
              set up on the DDCMP link for the asynchronous line.

              For more information about solving problems in your DECnet-
              Plus network, refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_PROB_SOLV)
              guide.

        A.1.2 Establishing a Dynamic Asynchronous Connection

              A dynamic asynchronous DECnet connection is a temporary
              connection between two nodes, usually over a telephone line
              through the use of modems. You can switch the line at each
              end of the connection from a terminal line to a dynamic
              asynchronous DECnet line. A dynamic asynchronous connection
              is usually maintained only for the duration of a telephone
              call.

              Dynamic switching of terminal lines to asynchronous DDCMP
              lines can occur between DECnet-Plus systems or between a
              DECnet-Plus system and a non DECnet-Plus system. Assuming
              that both the remote node and the local node are OpenVMS
              operating systems, the system manager at each node must
              have loaded the asynchronous driver, asydriver, and
              installed the shareable images asyswitch and asydynswitch.
              (If the local node is a personal computer, there is no need
              to load asydriver and install asydynswitch.) The system
              manager at the remote node must have enabled the use of
              virtual terminals on the system. First, the system manager
              must have enabled virtual terminals by issuing the sysgen
              connect command. The system manager must also have enabled
              virtual terminals on the system. The terminal devices,
              which you plan to use for dynamic connections, should be
              set up with the /disconnect qualifier.

                                      A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Any OpenVMS node that supports DECnet asynchronous
                connections can initiate a dynamic asynchronous
                connection to an OpenVMS node.

                ______________________________________________________

              Setting up a dynamic asynchronous connection involves two
              distinct sets of steps.

              1. At some point, you must configure your dynamic
                 asynchronous line. See Section A.1.2.1 for more
                 information about this.

              2. You dynamically switch the line to a DECnet line. See
                 Section A.1.2.2 for more information about this.

        A.1.2.1 Setting Up Dynamic Asynchronous Connections

              Use the following steps to manually set up your dynamic
              asynchronous line any time prior to the dynamic switch.
              This example assumes the local OpenVMS node is originating
              the connection and switching the terminal line on for
              DECnet use. The connection must be to an OpenVMS node on
              which you have an account with net$decnetaccess rights.

              To set up a dynamic asynchronous connection, you must
              execute the instructions discussed in this section at
              both the local and remote OpenVMS systems. If the remote
              system is a system other than OpenVMS, refer to the remote
              system's documentation for information about setting up a
              dynamic asynchronous connection.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you use the net$configure.com procedure to
                set up your dynamic asynchronous lines, then the
                net$startup.com and wandd$startup.com procedures load
                the asydriver, install the asynchronous shareable
                images, and configure the lines for you.

                ______________________________________________________

              1. Log in to the SYSTEM account on your OpenVMS node.

        Configuring Asynchronous Connections
        A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


              2. DECnet must be running on both nodes for the remaining
                 steps. If not already done, you and the remote system
                 manager must start up the network by entering the
                 following command:

                 $ @sys$startup:net$startup

              3. Load the asynchronous driver, asydriver.

                 Enter the following commands at your terminal (or
                 include them in the sys$manager:systartup_vms.com
                 command procedure before you boot the system):

                 $ run sys$system:sysgen
                 SYSGEN> connect asy0/noadapter/driver=asydriver
                 SYSGEN> exit

                 The asynchronous driver must be loaded before you can
                 make any asynchronous connection.

              4. Next, install the asynchronous shareable images. Use the
                 following command:

                 $ install add sys$library:asyswitch.exe/open/head/share

                 $ install add sys$library:asydynswitch.exe/open/head/share/protected

                 The following commands enable the use of virtual
                 terminals for the terminal line that is to be switched,
                 and set the disconnect characteristic for the terminal
                 line. (The virtual terminal capability permits the
                 process to continue running if the physical terminal
                 you are using becomes disconnected.)

                 $ run sys$system:sysgen
                 SYSGEN> connect vta0/noadapter/driver=ttdriver
                 SYSGEN> exit

                 $ set terminal/eight_bit/permanent/modem/disconnect terminal-port-name:

                 terminal-port-name is the name of the terminal port
                 on the remote node to which the dynamic asynchronous
                 connection is made. The terminal-port-name, for
                 instance, could be txa3.

              5. After you load asydriver and install the asynchronous
                 shareable images, you need to preconfigure the protocol
                 stack for the dynamic asynchronous line. A protocol
                 stack for a dynamic asynchronous connection is a routing
                 circuit that is mapped to a ddcmp logical station. The

                                      A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


                 ddcmp logical station uses a modem connect line created
                 with the communications port attribute specified as
                 either async or async-terminal_name (for example: async-
                 tx-0-3). You must configure the protocol stack before
                 you switch the dynamic asynchronous line into operation
                 by means of the DCL set terminal command. The following
                 steps explain how to do this.

                 If the configuration procedures have not already created
                 the Modem Connect module, create it manually before
                 configuring the line. Use the following example to set
                 up the necessary modem connect entities:

                 $ run sys$system:ncl

                 ncl> create modem connect line dynamic_asynch -
                 _ncl> communications port async_port_name 1

                 ncl> set modem connect line dynamic_asynch speed 2400

                 ncl> enable modem connect line dynamic_asynch

                 1  In dynamic asynchronous connections, you can specify
                    the communications port attribute (async_port_name)
                    in one of two ways when creating the modem connect
                    line entity:

                    o  async - When you specify async, a unique number
                       is given to the modem connect line as an "-n"
                       extension to the async name each time a modem
                       connect line with a communications port attribute
                       of ASYNC is created. This creates a "floating"
                       modem connect line, which is not tied to a
                       specific terminal device or unit. For example:

                       ncl> create modem connect line dynamic_asynch -
                       _ncl> communications port async

                       If you now display information about the port, you
                       will see that the line has a new communications
                       port name of async-n. For example:

                       ncl> show modem connect line dynamic_asynch communications port

                    o  async-dev-c-u - Specifying async-dev-c-u allows
                       you to set up a dynamic protocol tower on an
                       explicit line.

        Configuring Asynchronous Connections
        A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


                       For a dynamic line or circuit, the communications
                       port has one of two formats:

                       o  devcu as in txa0:

                       o  dev-c-u as in tx-0-0

                       where dev-c-u is defined as follows:

                       dev  The first two letters of the asynchronous
                            device name (possible values are tt and tx).

                       c    A decimal number (0 or a positive integer)
                            designating a device's hardware controller.
                            If the third letter of the device name is A,
                            c equals 0. If the third letter of the device
                            name is B, c equals 1, and so on.

                       u    The unit number of the device name; u is
                            always equal to 0 or a positive integer.

                       ncl> create modem connect line dynamic_asynch -
                       _ncl> communications port async-tx-0-3

                 If you request a specific device, txa3 (with the set
                 terminal command; see Section A.1.2.2, step 13), for a
                 dynamic asynchronous connection, the asydriver first
                 searches for an available modem connect line with
                 a communications port attribute of async-tx-0-3. If
                 this search fails, the asydriver then searches for a
                 "floating" modem connect line with a communications port
                 attribute of async-n. If asydriver finds a "floating"
                 line, it uses it. For the duration of this connection,
                 the communications port attribute is modified to async-
                 tx-0-3 so you can tell which terminal devices are
                 actively running dynamic asynchronous connections.

                 If asydriver does not find a "floating" line, the
                 dynamic switch fails. Either you have set up the
                 protocol stack incorrectly, or else all modem connect
                 lines are in use.

              6. Next, configure your data link and routing circuit. For
                 information about configuring your data link and routing
                 circuit, see the chapters on managing network security
                 and network management tasks in the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_
                 OVMS_NET_MGMT) guide.

                 establish optional routing initialization passwords.

        A.1.2.2 Switching on Dynamic Asynchronous Connections

              This section explains how to dynamically switch your line
              for communication.

              Figure A-1 shows a typical configuration in which dynamic
              asynchronous switching occurs over a dialup line. The local
              node in Figure A-1 is a standalone VAXstation 3100 system;
              the remote node is a VAX 8800. After the user at the local
              node dials in to the remote node, he or she can switch the
              lines connected to terminal ports tta2 and txb1 to dynamic
              asynchronous DDCMP.

              1. The following steps can be performed by any OpenVMS
                 user.

              2. Log in to your local OpenVMS system. This login creates
                 a process (identified by Process_L in Figure A-1).

              3. Enter the following DCL command:

                 $ set host/dte terminal-port-name:

                 terminal-port-name is the name of your local terminal
                 port that is connected to the modem. If both systems use
                 modems with autodial capabilities (for example, DF03,
                 DF112, or DF224 modems), you can optionally include the
                 /dial qualifier on the set host/dte command to cause
                 automatic dialing of the modem on the remote node, as
                 follows:




                                Configuring Asynchronous Connections A-15

 



        Configuring Asynchronous Connections
        A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


                 $ set host/dte/dial=number:number terminal-port-name:

              4. If you do not specify the /dial qualifier in the
                 previous step, dial the remote system manually. After
                 the dialup connection is made and you receive the remote
                 system welcome message, log in to your account on the
                 remote node. In this case, you supply your user name and
                 password to the remote OpenVMS operating system.

              5. If you are not using automatic dialing, dial in to the
                 remote node manually.

              6. Once the dialup connection is made and you receive the
                 remote OpenVMS system welcome message, log in to your
                 account on the remote node. This process is identified
                 by Process_R in Figure A-1.

              7. You can initiate the dynamic switch by specifying the
                 following DCL command on the remote node:

                 $ set terminal/network/switch=decnet

                 The set terminal command is an OpenVMS DCL command. If
                 you are on a node other than an OpenVMS node, specify
                 the equivalent function for your system.

              8. When the SET image on the remote system recognizes
                 the /NETWORK and /switch=decnet qualifiers, it calls
                 the shareable image asydynswitch (see Figure A-1). The
                 asydynswitch image verifies the link and sends an escape
                 sequence to the terminal emulator on the local system.
                 The escape sequence notifies the local terminal emulator
                 that the line connected to the remote system is becoming
                 a dynamic asynchronous line.

              9. When the terminal emulator at the local system receives
                 the escape sequence, it calls the asydynswitch image
                 (see Figure A-1) on the local system. The asydynswitch
                 image verifies the line on the local system and switches
                 it to an asynchronous DECnet line.

             10. When the switch occurs on the local system, asydriver
                 first searches for an explicitly named dynamic
                 asynchronous line. For example, if the switch is
                 on device tta1:, it searches for a line with a
                 communications port attribute of async-tt-0-1. If
                 asydriver cannot find that line, it searches for a
                 "floating" line (created with a communications port

                                     Configuring Asynchronous Connections
                                      A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


                 attribute of async). Because a protocol stack previously
                 had been preconfigured over this line, the data link
                 protocol now attempts to start the link.

             11. The local system then sends a ddcmp start message
                 (see Figure A-1) to the remote system that initiated
                 the dynamic switch. When asydynswitch on the remote
                 system detects the start message, it activates the
                 preconfigured local protocol stack. (For information
                 about the protocol stack, see Section A.1.2.1, steps
                 5-7.)

                 The remote system first searches for an explicitly
                 named dynamic asynchronous line. When it searches for
                 an explicitly named dynamic line, it searches for one
                 that refers to the physical terminal over which the
                 original switch was made. In Figure A-1, the remote
                 system searches for a line associated with port txb1.
                 Therefore, it looks for a line with a communications
                 port attribute of async-tx-1-1. If it does not find one,
                 it uses a "floating" async-n line. If this fails, the
                 dynamic switch fails.

             12. Since both ends of the link have a preconfigured
                 protocol stack, the DECnet link comes up over both
                 circuits. Any preconfigured security checks also occur
                 at this time.

                 The following message indicates that the terminal
                 emulator on the local system has exited and that the
                 DECnet link is being established:

                 %REM-S-END - control returned to local-nodename::
                 $

                 To check whether the communications link has come up,
                 specify the following command on the local system:

                 $ run sys$system:ncl

                 ncl> show routing circuit dynamic_asynch adjacency adjacent-node all
                 ncl> exit

                 If there is an adjacency, you can start to communicate
                 with the remote system over the asynchronous DECnet
                 connection.

             13. As an alternative to switching the terminal line to
                 a DECnet line automatically, you can switch the line
                 manually. If you originate a dynamic connection to an
                 OpenVMS node from a system other than OpenVMS, manual
                 switching is required; from an OpenVMS system, it is
                 optional. If you are originating the connection from
                 a node other than OpenVMS, follow system-specific
                 procedures to log in to the remote OpenVMS node by means
                 of terminal emulation.

                 Once you are logged in to the remote node, two steps are
                 required for manual switching:

                 a. Using your account on the remote OpenVMS node,
                    specify the set terminal command described in Step 7,
                    but add the /manual qualifier. For more information
                    see Section A.1.2.1, Step 5.

                    $ set terminal/network/switch=decnet/manual

                    You will receive the following message from the
                    remote node indicating the remote system is switching
                    its line to DECnet use:

                    %SET-I-SWINPRG The line you are currently logged over is becoming
                                   a DECnet line

                 b. You should exit from the terminal emulator and switch
                    your line manually to a DECnet line. The procedure
                    depends on the specific operating system on which you
                    are logged in.

                    The following example shows how an OpenVMS user
                    originating a dynamic connection exits from the
                    terminal emulator and turns on the DECnet line.

                    1. Exit from the terminal emulator: Press and
                       hold down the Control key while you press the \
                       (backslash) key on your OpenVMS system.

                    2. Enter the following command to switch your
                       terminal line to a DECnet line manually:

                       $ set terminal/network tta0:

                       tta0 is the name of the terminal port on the local
                       node.

                    3. Next, you must manually turn on the lines,
                       data links, and routing circuits connected to
                       your terminal port. See Steps 5 through 7 in
                       Section A.1.1 for information about setting up
                       your static asynchronous link.

                       Asynchronous DECnet is then started on the local
                       OpenVMS node.

        A.1.2.3 Managing Dynamic Asynchronous Resources

              You can define the following system logical names in
              sys$manager:net$logicals.com to manage the resources used
              by a dynamic asynchronous connection:

              o  asy$dynamic_maxlines

                 Specifies the maximum number of dynamic asynchronous
                 modem connect lines that can be active on a system at
                 any one time. You can specify values in the range of
                 0-65534 lines. The default is 16 lines. For example:

                 $ define/system asy$dynamic_maxlines 16

              o  asy$dynamic_line_timeout

                 Specifies the amount of time in seconds that a dynamic
                 asynchronous line waits before deciding that a dynamic
                 connection has broken. When the dynamic asynchronous
                 line decides that a link is broken, the line is
                 automatically switched back to a terminal line. You
                 can specify values in the range of 10-65535 seconds. The
                 default is 300 seconds. For example:

                 $ define/system asy$dynamic_line_timeout 300

        A.1.2.4 Terminating a Dynamic Asynchronous Connection

              Take the following steps to terminate a dynamic
              asynchronous connection:

              1. Disable the modem connect line and then re-enable it.
                 For example:

                 $ run sys$system:ncl

                 ncl> disable modem connect line dynamic_asynch

                 ncl> enable modem connect line terminal_line
                 ncl> exit

        Configuring Asynchronous Connections
        A.1 Asynchronous DECnet Connections


              2. Switch your asynchronous line back to a terminal line.

                 $ set terminal/permanent/nonetwork/typeahead terminal_port_name

              The dynamic asynchronous connection can also terminate, if
              the time specified by the logical name asy$dynamic_line_
              timeout expires. The link is considered idle if it has no
              input or output for the timeout interval. When this occurs,
              the link is broken and the line automatically switches from
              a DECnet line back to a terminal line. For more information
              about asy$dynamic_line_timeout, see Section A.1.2.3.

        A.1.2.5 Reasons for Failure of Dynamic Asynchronous Connections

              If you are using dynamic switching and the asynchronous
              DECnet connection is not made, check that:

              o  DECnet-Plus has been started.

              o  WANDD has been started.

              o  The asydriver has been loaded (the asy0 device is
                 present).

              o  The asyswitch has been installed.

              o  The asydynswitch has been installed.

              o  The modem connect lines have been configured correctly.

              o  Virtual terminals must be enabled both on the remote
                 node and, in particular, for the terminal at which you
                 are logged in. The terminal line at the remote node must
                 have the attribute disconnect set.

              o  After you enter a set terminal command with the /manual
                 qualifier, you must specify NCL commands to turn on the
                 DECnet line within approximately 2 minutes or the line
                 returns to terminal mode.

              If the logical station is in the on-starting state, check
              that:

              o  The routing circuits have been configured correctly.

              o  The routing initialization passwords on each node must
                 be set correctly. (Refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_
                 NET_MGMT) guide.)

              o  The parity is correct. Asynchronous DECnet requires the
                 parity on the asynchronous line to be set to none and
                 the terminal line to be set up to use 8-bit characters.
                 If you are using a non OpenVMS system, you must check
                 that the terminal line is set to the correct parity.

                                                   Configuring Transports


        B.1 Overview

              To configure NSP Transport, OSI Transport, DECnet over
              TCP/IP, or OSI over TCP/IP on your system, invoke the
              sys$manager:net$configure using the ADVANCED option, and
              select Option 4 ("Configure Transports"). Section 1.4
              and Section 1.5 in this manual describe in detail the
              questions net$configure asks in order to configure the
              transports. DIGITAL recommends that you do not modify the
              NSP and OSI startup scripts that net$configure creates.
              (These scripts in SYS$MANAGER are named NET$NSP_TRANSPORT_
              STARTUP.NCL and NET$OSI_TRANSPORT_STARTUP.NCL.) DIGITAL
              also recommends that you accept the default settings for
              the various attributes.

              This appendix describes the NCL commands that you can
              use to manually create and modify these transports if
              necessary. Refer to <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_NCL_REF) for more
              information about transport attributes.

        B.2 Manually Configuring NSP

              This section describes how to configure the Network
              Services Protocol (NSP). The following example shows the
              commands to create the nsp entity on your system. DIGITAL
              recommends that you accept the default settings (used in
              the example) for the various attributes and change these
              only if you need to. Refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_NCL_
              ref) for more information about these attributes.

              _ncl> retransmit threshold 5
              ncl> enable nsp

              1  The effect of delay factor is to increase the
                 retransmission time by increasing the average round-
                 trip delay time, thus allowing for additional network
                 delay.

                 The value of the weighting factor is given by the
                 delay weight characteristic. Basically, delay weight
                 determines how quickly the retransmission timer responds
                 to variations in actual round-trip delay times. A low
                 value of delay weight means that the retransmission
                 timer responds quickly to each sample of round-trip
                 delay time; a delay weight of 0 means that an estimate
                 is nearly the same as the last actual sample of round-
                 trip delay. A high value for delay weight reduces the
                 impact of recent variations in network delay; the higher
                 the value, the closer each estimate of round-trip delay
                 is to the average of all estimates.

                 The default values of delay factor and delay weight
                 should be suitable for most networks. However, consider
                 increasing these values if there are wide variations in
                 round-trip delay times on your network.

              2  You can save memory resources by reducing the value of
                 maximum remote nsaps. However, you do not have access
                 to the information provided by this entity's counters
                 and status attributes (except through information in
                 event logs). The maximum NSAPs must be greater than the
                 maximum transport connection.

              For some NSP characteristics, such as maximum remote nsaps,
              or maximum transport connections, you can raise values
              at any time, but you cannot lower the value without first
              disabling NSP.

                                             B.2 Manually Configuring NSP


              The following is an example of how to set up NSP:

              ncl> create nsp
              ncl> set nsp maximum window 8
              ncl> set nsp maximum transport connections 200
              ncl> set nsp maximum receive buffers 2000
              ncl> enable nsp
              ncl> create session control transport service nsp protocol %x04

        B.2.1 Transmit and Receive Window

              NSP receiver's window is controlled by a combination of
              Maximum Transport Connections, Maximum Receive Buffers, and
              Maximum Window.

              The receiver initial quota is determined by dividing
              Maximum Receive Buffers by Maximum Transport Connections.
              During the life of the connection, the receiver quota
              fluctuates, using the value of Maximum Receive Buffers
              divided by Currently Active Connections. The credit window
              sent to the remote transmitter may or may not be this quota
              value, depending on the value of Maximum Window. If Maximum
              Window is set to less than the determined receiver quota,
              this value is used instead for the credit granted to the
              remote transmitter.

              The transmitter on an NSP connection uses the credit sent
              by the remote receiver as its transmit window, unless
              Maximum Window is a lower value. In that case, Maximum
              Window is used for the transmitter window.

              By controlling the transmitter's and receiver's window as
              above a dynamic balance of system resource consumption and
              network performance may be achieved and maintained.

        B.3 Manually Configuring the OSI Transport Service

              This section describes how to configure the OSI transport
              service. The following example shows the commands to create
              the osi transport entity on your system. DIGITAL recommends
              that you accept the default settings (used in the example)
              for the various attributes and change these only if you
              need to. Refer to the <REFERENCE>(dnplus_ncl_ref) for more
              information about these attributes.

              The characteristics specified in the following
              command example are those that apply to all types of
              network service. For details of osi transport entity
              characteristics that are specific to Connection-Oriented
              Network Service (CONS) or Connectionless-Mode Network
              Service (CLNS), see Section B.3.2 or Section B.3.3.

              _ncl> maximum transport connections 33, maximum window 20

              ncl> enable osi transport

              1  The effect of delay factor is to increase the
                 retransmission time by increasing the average round-
                 trip delay time, thus allowing for additional network
                 delay.

                 The value of the weighting factor is given by the
                 delay weight characteristic. Basically, delay weight
                 determines how quickly the retransmission timer responds
                 to variations in actual round-trip delay times. A low
                 value of delay weight means that the retransmission
                 timer responds very quickly to each sample of round-trip
                 delay time; a delay weight of 0 means that an estimate
                 is nearly the same as the last actual sample of round-
                 trip delay. A high value for delay weight reduces the
                 impact of recent variations in network delay; the higher
                 the value, the closer each estimate of round-trip delay
                 is to the average of all estimates.

                 The default values of delay factor and delay weight
                 should be suitable for most networks. However, consider
                 increasing its value if there are wide variations in
                 round-trip delay times on your network.

                 For a complete discussion of delay factor and delay
                 weight and how to calculate round-trip delay, refer to
                 <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_NET_MGMT).

              2  You can save memory resources by reducing the value of
                 maximum remote nsaps. However, you will not have access
                 to the information provided by this entity's counters
                 and status attributes (except through information in
                 event logs). The maximum remote NSAPs cannot be lower
                 than the maximum transport connections.

              You must disable the osi transport entity before you can
              modify any of its characteristics.

        B.3.1 Transmit and Receive Window

              OSI transport receiver's window is controlled by a
              combination of Maximum Transport Connections, Maximum
              Receive Buffers, and Maximum Window. The receiver initial
              quota is determined by dividing Maximum Receive Buffers
              by Maximum Transport Connections. During the life of
              the connection, the receiver quota fluctuates, using the
              value of Maximum Receive Buffers divided by Currently
              Active Connections. The credit window sent to the remote
              transmitter may or may not be this quota value, depending
              on the value of Maximum Window. If Maximum Window is set to
              less than the determined receiver quota, this value is used
              instead for the credit granted to the remote transmitter.

              The transmitter on an OSI transport connection uses the
              credit sent by the remote receiver as its transmit window,
              unless Maximum Window is a lower value. In that case,
              Maximum Window is used for the transmitter window.

              By controlling the transmitter's and receiver's window as
              above a dynamic balance of system resource consumption and
              network performance may be achieved and maintained.

              The following NCL script creates and sets up OSI transport,
              including the Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS),
              and the Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS)
              services.

        B.3.2 Configuring the Connection-Oriented Network Service

              The following sections describe how to configure the
              Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS). CONS is a
              network service that operates according to a connection-
              oriented model. Before data can be exchanged, a connection
              must first be established. X.25 provides this type of
              service.

                       B.3 Manually Configuring the OSI Transport Service


        B.3.2.1 Establishing Outbound Connections Using CONS

              To establish an outbound transport connection that uses
              CONS as its network service, an application makes a
              connection request in which it specifies:

              o  The OSI transport address of the destination host.

              o  The OSI transport service access point identifier (TSAP-
                 ID) of the remote application. A TSAP-ID identifies
                 a TSAP. A TSAP is a unique identifier for a single
                 transport user.

              o  Optionally, other transport connection parameters.

              The OSI transport address consists of:

              o  The name of the OSI transport template to be used in
                 setting up the transport connection. The specified
                 OSI transport template must have its network service
                 characteristic set to cons.

              o  A network address that uniquely identifies the
                 destination host. The network address for a CONS
                 connection is a DTE address.

              OSI transport either creates a new network connection
              (using either X.25 or X25 Access), or uses an existing
              outbound network connection (provided the transport
              connection is class 2 or class 4). If a new connection
              is to be created, X.25 uses the DTE address from the OSI
              transport address and the X25 Access template specified in
              the OSI transport template to set up a network connection.

        B.3.2.2 Establishing Inbound Connections Using CONS

              To establish an inbound transport connection:

              1. OSI transport must be listening to one or more X25
                 Access filters.

                 X.25 or X25 Access passes calls from these filters up to
                 OSI transport.

              2. OSI transport must have an OSI transport template for
                 CONS connections with its inbound characteristic set
                 to TRUE. This OSI transport template must also specify
                 an X25 Access template with the same name (including
                 matching case) as the X25 Access filter on which a call
                 arrives.

        Configuring Transports
        B.3 Manually Configuring the OSI Transport Service


              3. If a suitable OSI transport template for CONS
                 connections is found, it is used to accept the call,
                 using the X25 Access template specified in the OSI
                 transport template.

              4. The incoming transport connection can then be received.
                 If an application is found to receive the inbound
                 request, the application can accept or reject the
                 request.

              5. If the application accepts the inbound request, the OSI
                 transport template for CONS connections is used for the
                 accept.

              For incoming connections to applications that are invoked
              by passive TSAP association, you must also configure one
              or more OSI transport application entities to represent the
              passive association between a TSAP-ID and an application.
              Refer to the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_OVMS_NET_MGMT) guide for
              information about managing application entities.

        B.3.2.3 Manually Configuring Support for CONS

              To configure CONS support, each element in the set of the
              CONS filters attribute of the OSI transport entity must
              have a corresponding X25 Access filter of the same name.
              By default, the CONS filters attribute of the OSI transport
              entity is set to OSI transport.

              Similarly, the CONS template attribute of the OSI transport
              template subentity must contain a name that is a PSI filter
              and is contained in the set of CONS filters of the OSI
              transport entity. The default value of the CONS template
              attribute of an OSI transport template subentity is OSI
              transport.

              The following steps list the commands required to configure
              CONS. The characteristics added or set up for OSI transport
              in this example are relevant to CONS. In addition, consider
              setting some of the more general characteristics shown in
              Section B.3.

              For the variables, substitute values appropriate to your
              configuration. DIGITAL recommends that you accept the
              default settings (used in the example) for the various
              attributes. Change them only if you need to. Refer to the

              <REFERENCE>(dnplus_ncl_ref) guide for more information
              about these attributes.

              1. The following example shows how to create the OSI
                 transport module, set its characteristics, and enable
                 it.

                 ncl> create osi transport

                 ncl> add osi transport cons filters {filter-name} 1

                 ncl> set osi transport disconnect holdback 0, - 2
                 _ncl> maximum multiplexing 65535, maximum network connections 65535 3

                 ncl> enable osi transport

                 1  Specifies the names of one or more X.25 filters used
                    to listen for incoming transport connection requests.
                    If you do not specify any X.25 filters, a default
                    filter called OSI transport is used.

                 2  Set a high value for disconnect holdback if you want
                    to keep idle network connections. This saves the cost
                    of re-establishing network connections. You should be
                    aware, however, that this is unnecessarily costly if
                    the network connection remains idle.

                    Set disconnect holdback to 0 if you want to lose idle
                    network connections as soon as possible.

                    disconnect holdback is supported only for transport
                    protocol classes 2 and 4.

                 3  Sets the value of maximum multiplexing. Increasing
                    the value saves on the cost of network connections
                    but reduces the throughput for each transport
                    connection that uses a multiplexed network
                    connection.

                    maximum multiplexing is supported only for transport
                    protocol classes 2 and 4.

                    If you set maximum network connections too low, local
                    transport users might be unable to make transport
                    connection requests, particularly if all the active
                    network connections are inbound. For example,
                    if the limit is 7 and there are 7 active network
                    connections, all inbound, then local transport users

                    you either increase the value of maximum network

                    connections or one of the network connections is
                    released by a remote host.

              2. The following example shows how to create the OSI
                 transport templates:

                 ncl> create osi transport template template-name 1

                 ncl> set osi transport template template-name -
                 _ncl> acknowledgment delay time 1, -
                 _ncl> checksums false, classes {4}, - 2
                 _ncl> cons template osi transport, cr timeout 30, er timeout 30, - 3

                 _ncl> inbound true, initial retransmit time 15, loopback false, - 4
                 _ncl> keepalive time 60, maximum nsdu size 2048, -
                 _ncl> network service cons, retransmit threshold 8 5

                 ncl> enable osi transport template template-name

                 1  OSI transport templates are used by OSI transport
                    to supply connection parameters not provided by the
                    requesting OSI transport application.

                    An OSI transport template name must contain only
                    alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), hyphens (-
                    ), or dollar ($) signs. OSI transport template names
                    should not be more than 16 characters long.

                    You can configure two types of OSI transport
                    templates for CONS connections:

                    o  For outbound connections only

                       You can configure as many outbound OSI transport
                       templates as you want.

                    o  For both outbound and inbound connections

                       You should configure a single outbound-inbound OSI
                       transport template for each X25 Access filter used
                       by inbound transport connections.

                 2  Including checksums reduces data throughput. Use
                    checksums only if you have reason to believe that
                    data will be corrupted by the network.

                 3  The default value for cr timeout is adequate for
                    most networks. However, consider increasing the
                    value if you find that a high proportion of transport
                    connection requests are being timed out.

                       B.3 Manually Configuring the OSI Transport Service


                 4  When true, inbound specifies that this OSI transport
                    template for CONS connections can be used for inbound
                    as well as outbound connections.

                    The default initial retransmit time value should be
                    suitable for most networks. It is set to a relatively
                    high value to reflect the fact that a transport
                    connection request Transport layer protocol data
                    unit (TPDU) usually has a longer round-trip delay
                    than a data TPDU. Consider increasing the value if
                    transport connection requests frequently time out.

                    You can set up different OSI transport templates to
                    provide different values of this characteristic for
                    networks with significantly different round-trip
                    delay. For example, round-trip delay on an X.25 PSDN
                    is usually much greater than on an 802.3 LAN.

                 5  network service cons indicates that transport
                    connections set up using a specified template
                    will use CONS. An OSI transport template for CONS
                    connections configured with the net$configure
                    procedure have this characteristic set correctly.
                    However, if you create a CONS OSI transport template
                    directly, you must set this characteristic, because
                    the default is CLNS. The default value for retransmit
                    threshold should be suitable for most networks.
                    However, consider increasing the value for networks
                    with a high probability of losing data.

              3. The following example creates the X25 Access module, and
                 enables it:

                 ncl> create x25 access
                 ncl> enable x25 access

              4. The following example shows how to create the x25 access
                 template and set its characteristics:

                 ncl> create x25 access template template-name 1

                 ncl> set x25 access template template-name -
                 _ncl> call data hex-string, dte class dte-class-name 2

                 1  Outbound transport connections that use X.25 network
                    connections use X25 Access templates to supply
                    most of the parameters for setting up the network
                    connection. Inbound transport connections that

        Configuring Transports
        B.3 Manually Configuring the OSI Transport Service


                    use X.25 connections use X25 Access templates to
                    negotiate network connection parameters.

                    Each OSI transport template for CONS connections that
                    you configure names an X25 Access template in its
                    cons template characteristic. You must, therefore,
                    configure each of the X25 Access templates named in
                    your OSI transport templates for CONS connections.

                 2  When you create an X25 Access template for use with
                    CONS, set the value of the call data characteristic
                    to %X03010100. The destination host will recognize
                    this value as indicating that the call should be
                    passed to CONS.

              5. The following example shows how to create the x25 access
                 filter:

                 ncl> create x25 access filter filter-name 1

                 ncl> set x25 access filter filter-name -
                 _ncl> call data mask mask, call data value value, - 2
                 _ncl> inbound dte class dte-class-name

                 1  If your system is to accept inbound transport
                    connections over X.25 network connections, you need
                    to configure one or more X25 Access filters. An X25
                    Access filter listens for incoming network connection
                    requests and passes these requests to the appropriate
                    destination. One or more X25 Access filters are
                    required for each X25 Access DTE class that CONS
                    wants to use.

                    Each outbound-inbound OSI transport template for
                    CONS connections that you configure specifies the
                    name of an X25 Access template in its cons template
                    characteristic. This X25 Access template will be used
                    to accept an inbound network connection. The name
                    of this X25 Access template must be the same as the
                    name of an X25 Access filter that is used to receive
                    inbound network connections.

                 2  When you create an X25 Access filter for use by CONS,
                    set call data mask to %Xffffffff.

                    When you create an X25 Access filter for use by CONS,
                    set call data value to %X03010100.

        B.3.3 Manually Configuring the Connectionless-Mode Network
              Service

              The following sections describe how to configure the
              Connectionless-Mode Network Service (CLNS). CLNS is a
              network service that operates according to a datagram
              model. Each message is routed and delivered to its
              destination independently of any other. When using CLNS,
              only TP4 is available in the default configuration.

        B.3.3.1 Establishing Outbound Connections Using CLNS

              To establish an outbound transport connection that uses
              CLNS as its network service, an application makes a
              connection request in which it specifies:

              o  The OSI transport address of the destination host.

              o  The TSAP-ID of the responding application. A TSAP-ID
                 identifies a TSAP. A TSAP is a unique identifier for a
                 single transport user.

              o  Optionally, other transport connection parameters.

              The OSI transport address consists of:

              o  The name of the OSI transport template for CLNS
                 connections to be used in setting up the transport
                 connection. The specified OSI transport template
                 for CLNS connections must have its network service
                 characteristic set to clns.

              o  An address that uniquely identifies the destination
                 host. The address can be:

                 -  An NSAP (for a transport connection using CLNS/ES-IS)

                 -  A LAN address (for a transport connection using CLNS
                    with Null Internet)

              The Routing module selects a routing circuit to be used
              for the underlying network connection; the basis for this
              selection is the area address part of the NSAP address.

        Configuring Transports
        B.3 Manually Configuring the OSI Transport Service


        B.3.3.2 Establishing Inbound Connections Using CLNS

              To establish an inbound transport connection that uses
              CLNS:

              1. The Routing module passes an incoming transport
                 connection to OSI transport. OSI transport must have
                 an OSI transport template for CLNS connections with its
                 inbound characteristic set to TRUE. If the transport
                 connection uses Null Internet, the OSI transport
                 template for CLNS connections must also have its clns
                 inactive area address characteristic set to the same
                 area address as the inactive area address characteristic
                 of the routing circuit on which the transport connection
                 arrived.

              2. If a suitable OSI transport template for CLNS
                 connections is found, an application is found to process
                 the connection. The application can either accept or
                 reject the connection.

              3. If the application accepts the connection, the OSI
                 transport template for CLNS connections is used to
                 accept the connection.

        B.3.3.3 Steps for Configuring CLNS

              The following steps show the commands to configure CLNS.
              The characteristic added or set up for OSI transport in
              this example is relevant to CLNS. In addition, consider
              setting some of the more general characteristics shown in
              Section B.3.

              For the variables, substitute values appropriate to your
              configuration. DIGITAL recommends that you accept the
              default settings (used in the example) for the various
              attributes. Change them only if you need to. Refer to the
              <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_ncl_ref) guide for more information
              about these attributes.

              1. The following example creates the OSI transport module
                 and enables it:

                 ncl> set osi transport nsap selector 33 1
                 ncl> enable osi transport

                 1  nsap selector is used for transport connections using
                    CLNS/ES-IS.

              2. The following example shows how to create the OSI
                 transport template and set its characteristics:

                 ncl> create osi transport template template-name 1

                 ncl> set osi transport template -
                 _ncl> acknowledgment delay time 1, -
                 _ncl> checksums false, classes {4}, clns inactive area address {}, - 2

                 _ncl> inbound true, initial retransmit time 15, keepalive time 60, - 3
                 _ncl> loopback false, network service clns, retransmit threshold 8, - 4
                 _ncl> security empty, use clns error reports false

                 ncl> enable osi transport template

                 1  OSI transport templates are used by OSI transport
                    to supply connection parameters not provided by the
                    requesting OSI transport application.

                    An OSI transport template name must contain only
                    alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), hyphens (-
                    ), or dollar ($) signs. OSI transport template names
                    should not be more than 16 characters long.

                    You can configure two types of OSI transport
                    templates for CLNS connections:

                    o  For outbound transport connections only

                       You can configure as many outbound OSI transport
                       templates for CLNS connections as you want.

                    o  For both outbound and inbound transport
                       connections

                       A CLNS OSI transport template is configured to
                       use either the CLNS/ES-IS or Null Internet Routing
                       Protocol.

                       If you configure Null Internet OSI transport
                       templates, you must configure one outbound-inbound
                       OSI transport template for each inactive area
                       address used.

                 2  Including checksums reduces data throughput, so
                    you should use checksums only if you have reason to
                    believe that data will be corrupted by the network.

                 3  The default initial retransmit time value should be
                    suitable for most networks. It is set to a relatively
                    high value because a transport connection request
                    TPDU usually has a longer round-trip delay than a
                    data TPDU. Consider increasing the value if transport
                    connection requests frequently time out.

                 4  The default value for retransmit threshold should
                    be suitable for most networks. However, consider
                    increasing the value for networks with a high
                    probability of losing data.

              3. The following example shows how to set up routing
                 for end systems using the Connectionless-mode Network
                 Service.

                 ncl> create routing type endnode

                 _ncl> manual network entity titles {}, probe rate 20

                 ncl> enable routing

              4. The following example shows how to set up a routing
                 circuit for end systems using the Connectionless-mode
                 Network Service.

                 ncl> create routing circuit hdlc-0 type hdlc 1

                 ncl> set routing circuit hdlc-0 data link entity -
                 _ncl> hdlc link hdlc-0 logical station hdlc-0, - 2
                 _ncl> manual data link sdu size 1492, - 3
                 _ncl> template template-name 4

                 ncl> enable routing circuit hdlc-0

                 1  You need to configure routing circuits:

                    o  For CLNS connections over a LAN. You can configure
                       a routing circuit for each LAN device on your
                       system. Each LAN routing circuit supports the
                       CLNS/ES-IS Routing Protocol; it can optionally
                       also support Null Internet.

                       can configure two types of synchronous circuits:

                       -  HDLC

                       -  DDCMP

                    o  For CLNS connections over an X.25 network.

                       You can configure four types of X.25 routing
                       circuit:

                       -  Static outgoing (for outbound connections only)

                       -  Static incoming (for inbound connections only)

                       -  Dynamic assigned (for both outbound and inbound
                          connections)

                       -  Permanent (for both outbound and inbound
                          connections)

                    The following table lists the supported routing
                    circuits for CLNS.

                    where link-name is the generic name of the link

                    example, hdlc-0).

                    For ddcmp circuits, this characteristic is set to:

                    ddcmp link link-name logical station station-name

                    where link-name is the generic name of the link

                    example, ddcmp-0).

                    For x.25 circuits, this characteristic is set to:

                 3  The manual data link sdu size characteristic is valid

                    circuits and valid for all other circuits.

                 when setting up a routing circuit with CLNS. It also

                 For inactive area address:

                 Each LAN circuit that supports Null Internet must
                 specify a different inactive area address.

                 For circuits using only CLNS/ES-IS, this characteristic
                 is an empty set (this is the default value).

                 For initial minimum timer:

                 On X.25 static incoming or outgoing circuits, if no
                 adjacency has been established when this timer expires,
                 the circuit is cleared.

              5. The following example configures a reachable address for
                 an X.25 routing circuit.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                You have to configure a reachable address only if you
                have configured one or more dynamic assigned routing
                circuits.

                 ncl> enable routing circuit hdlc-0 -
                 _ncl> reachable address

                 1  If you configure a dynamic assigned X.25 routing
                    circuit, you must configure one or more reachable
                    addresses to be used to manage the circuit. Each
                    reachable address specifies a mapping of an NSAP
                    address to a DTE address.

                 2  Specify the address prefix when you create the
                    entity. You cannot modify this characteristic with
                    the set command.

              6. The following example creates the X25 Access module and
                 enables it:

                 ncl> create x25 access
                 ncl> enable x25 access

              7. The following example shows how to create the x25 access
                 template and set its characteristics:

                 ncl> create x25 access template template-name 1

                 ncl> set x25 access template template-name -
                 _ncl> destination dte address dte-address, -
                 _ncl> dte class dte-class-name

                 1  A routing circuit that invokes outbound X.25 calls
                    uses an X25 Access template to supply most of the
                    parameters for setting up the call. A routing circuit
                    that receives inbound X.25 calls uses an X25 Access
                    template to negotiate call parameters.

                    Each X.25 routing circuit that you configure names an
                    X25 Access template in its template characteristic.
                    You must therefore configure each of the X25 Access
                    templates named in your X.25 routing circuits.

              8. The following example creates the x25 access filter:

                 ncl> create x25 access filter filter-name 1

                 ncl> set x25 access filter filter-name -
                 _ncl> inbound dte class dte-class-name,  -
                 _ncl> sending dte address dte-address

                 ncl> enable x25 access filter

                 1  A routing circuit that receives inbound X.25 calls
                    requires one or more X25 Access filters. An X25
                    Access filter listens for incoming calls and passes
                    them to the appropriate destination.

                    Each X.25 static-incoming or X.25 dynamic-assigned
                    routing circuit that you configure specifies the
                    name of one or more X25 Access filters in its filter
                    characteristic. You must, therefore, configure the
                    specified X25 Access filters.

                    When setting up a filter for use with an x.25 static
                    incoming or x.25 da circuits, specify the following
                    X25 Access filter values:

                    o  call data mask %xff

                    o  call data value %x81

        B.3.3.4 Providing Communications Between OSI Transport Systems
                and VOTS Systems Using CLNS

              If you need communication between a VOTS system and an OSI
              transport system using the full Internet CLNS protocol,
              you must use an intermediate system (router). OSI transport
              implements only the Internet protocol. An OSI Transport
              system has no way of finding another end system that does
              not support ES-IS without using an intermediate system.

              If a DEC WANrouter is used as an intermediate system, it
              must be configured as a link state router (see the previous
              section).

              If the VOTS system and the DEC WANrouter reside on the same
              LAN subnetwork and the VOTS system is configured with a
              DNA-compatible NSAP address, the DEC WANrouter need only be
              configured as a level 1 router.

        Configuring Transports
        B.3 Manually Configuring the OSI Transport Service


              If the VOTS system does not have a DNA-compatible NSAP
              address, or if the VOTS system and the DEC WANrouter do not
              reside on the same LAN subnetwork, the DEC WANrouter must
              be configured as a level 2 router.

              When using a level 1 router, you must create a manual
              adjacency on the router for the VOTS system. When using
              a level 2 router, you must create a reachable address
              on the router for the VOTS system. See the DEC WANrouter
              configuration and management guides for details about how
              to configure manual adjacencies and reachable addresses.

              OSI transport systems and VOTS systems on the same LAN can
              communicate without an intermediate system, using the Null
              Internet CLNS protocol.

        B.4 Manually Configuring OSI Transport Network Applications

              This section describes how to configure applications to
              receive connection requests from remote hosts. One of the
              attributes of a transport connection request is a transport
              service access point identifier (TSAP-ID), which uniquely
              identifies the transport application on the remote host to
              which the connection request is to be passed.

              An application that expects to receive a connection request
              must therefore associate itself with a particular TSAP-
              ID, so the transport service knows which application a
              particular connection request is intended for.

              There are two ways in which an application can associate
              itself with a TSAP-ID: active association or passive
              association.

              Active association is entirely under the control of the
              transport user, and requires no support from you. Passive
              association, on the other hand, requires that you configure
              the osi transport application entities that describe the
              association between TSAP-IDs and applications.

              In active association, the transport application issues
              a $qio(io$_acpcontrol) system service call in which it
              requests an association with a specified TSAP-ID. When a
              connection request arrives with that TSAP-ID, a mailbox
              message containing details of the connection request is
              sent to the associated application, which can then process
              the request, either accepting or rejecting it.

              B.4 Manually Configuring OSI Transport Network Applications


              OSI transport dynamically creates the osi transport port
              entity so that the active association is available by means
              of network management.

              In passive association, you create a osi transport
              application entity, whose characteristics specify:

              o  A TSAP-ID.

              o  The name of an image or command file.

              o  The user name of an account under which the image or
                 command file is to run.

              When a connection request arrives with a TSAP-ID that
              is associated with a osi transport application entity,
              the transport service creates a new process in which
              it runs loginout.exe. loginout.exe validates any access
              control information and invokes DCL to execute the image or
              command file associated with that TSAP-ID. Details of the
              connection request are passed in the logical name sys$net.

              The following command example shows the commands to
              configure an osi transport application entity. For
              the variables, substitute values appropriate to your
              configuration. DIGITAL, however, recommends that you accept
              the default settings (used in the example) for the various
              attributes and change these only if you need to. Refer to
              the <REFERENCE>(DNPLUS_NCL_REF) for more information about
              these attributes.

              1  called tsels specifies the set of TSAP-IDs with which
                 this entity is to be associated.

              2  file name specifies the name of the command or image
                 file to be executed when a connection request is
                 received with a TSAP-ID that matches one of the values
                 of the called tsels characteristic.

                 user name specifies the user account under which the
                 application is to run.

        B.4.1 Customizing End Selector for OSI Transport

              The network service access points (NSAP) selector
              determines which transport service is used by a network
              connection. The default NSAP selector for DIGITAL's OSI
              transport implementations is 33 (decimal). Other vendors
              might use different NSAP selectors and might require that
              the NSAP selectors match.

              You can only change the NSAP selector for OSI transport
              when OSI transport is disabled. Valid NSAP selectors are
              in the range from 2 to 255, with the exception of 32. In
              order to maintain interoperability between DNA Phase IV and
              DECnet-Plus, you cannot use NSP's NSAP selector, 32.

              The command to change the NSAP selector for OSI transport
              is:

              ncl> disable osi transport
              ncl> set osi transport nsap selector new_selector_number

              ncl> enable osi transport

        B.4.2 Enabling Use of CLNS Error Reports

              OSI transport can recognize the unavailability of a remote
              node during connection establishment using CLNS (Routing)
              error reports.

              This feature is disabled for all templates (used
              by DNA Session Control), but you can enable it by
              editing the OSI transport NCL initialization script,
              sys$manager:net$osi_transport_startup.ncl, and using the
              following command to set the default to true:

              ncl> set osi transport template default use clns error reports = true

        B.5 Using DECnet over TCP/IP (RFC 1859) and OSI over TCP/IP (RFC
            1006)

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS allows you to run DNA and OSI

                                                   Configuring Transports
   B.5 Using DECnet over TCP/IP (RFC 1859) and OSI over TCP/IP (RFC 1006)


              RFC 1006 and RFC 1859 (formerly known as RFC 1006
              Extension) are standards of the Internet community. RFC
              1006 defines how to implement ISO 8073 Class 0 on top of
              TCP. Hosts that implement RFC 1006 are expected to listen
              on TCP port 102.

              RFC 1859 defines how to implement ISO 8073 Transport Class
              2 Non-use of Explicit Flow Control on top of TCP. Hosts
              that implement RFC 1859 are expected to listen on TCP port
              399.

              The DECnet over TCP/IP feature (RFC 1859) allows
              traditional DECnet applications (such as MAIL, CTERM, and
              FAL) to accept IP names and addresses. The OSI applications
              over TCP/IP feature (RFC 1006) allows OSI applications
              (such as FTAM and VT) to accept IP names and addresses.

        B.5.1 Configuring RFC 1006 and/or RFC 1859

              If you want to use DECnet over TCP/IP and/or OSI
              applications over TCP/IP, invoke net$configure.com with
              the ADVANCED option, and select Option 4 ("Configure
              Transports") to configure (or reconfigure) the OSI
              transport. You can then create a new OSI transport NCL
              script (or replace the old script). You must also include
              Domain in your Session Control naming search path by
              selecting Option 2 to rename your node using a Domain
              secondary node name. This is described in Section 2.2.

              For the changes to take effect, either disable the OSI
              transport entity (if it exists) and invoke the new OSI
              transport NCL script, or reboot the system.

              ncl> disable osi transport
              ncl> do sys$manager:net$osi_transport_startup.ncl

              When configuring RFC 1006, RFC 1859, or both, each element
              in the set of RFC 1006 listener ports attribute corresponds
              to a TCP listener port. By default, net$configure sets the
              OSI transport RFC 1006 listener ports attribute to { 102,
              399 }. Port 102 is required for RFC 1006, and port 399 is
              required for RFC 1859.

        Configuring Transports
        B.5 Using DECnet over TCP/IP (RFC 1859) and OSI over TCP/IP (RFC 1006)


        B.5.2 Creating Additional OSI Transport Templates for RFC 1006
              and RFC 1859

              To create RFC 1006 or RFC 1859 templates in addition to
              the default templates, use Option 4 under the ADVANCED
              configuration option. When the net$configure.com procedure
              asks you if you want to create additional OSI templates,
              answer yes. Then select RFC 1006 as the network service.

              The RFC 1006 port number attribute of the OSI transport
              template subentity must contain a TCP port number that is
              one of the chosen RFC 1006 or RFC 1859 listener ports. The
              default value for the RFC 1006 port number attribute is
              102. If you create an OSI transport template subentity to
              use with DECnet over TCP/IP (RFC 1859), then set the RFC
              1006 port number attribute of that template to 399.

        B.5.3 Disabling DECnet-Plus over TCP/IP

              DECnet-Plus only attempts to locate TCP/IP if the RFC 1006
              listener ports attribute set of the OSI transport entity is
              not empty.

              To disable RFC 1006 and RFC 1859, issue the following
              command:

              ncl> set osi transport rfc1006 listener ports {}
