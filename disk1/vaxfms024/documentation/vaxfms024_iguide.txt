               ____________________________________________________________
               1.2  Prerequisite and Optional Software

                  This section discusses the software you must have installed on
                  your system before installing VAX FMS. The section also includes
                  information about software that you can use together with VAX FMS.
                  Please refer to the System Software Addendum (SSA) for a complete
                  list of compatible products and their required version numbers.
                  The SSA is part of the Software Product Description (SPD).

                  VAX FMS Version 2.4 requires VMS Version 5.0 or higher.

                  If the optional software uses the VAX CDD/Plus, or if the VAX DBMS
                  is to be part of the system, you should install those software
                  products before you install VAX FMS. Note that CDDSHR.EXE must al-
                  ways be installed using the Install Utility (see Section 1.5.5.2).

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.3  Prerequisite Hardware

                  To run the postinstallation Installation Verification Procedure
                  (IVP), you must have a video terminal. See Chapter 4 for more
                  information on the postinstallation IVP.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.4  VMS License Management Facility

                  The VMS License Management Facility is available with Version 5.0
                  of the VMS operating system. If you are installing VAX FMS on a
                  VMS Version 5.0 or higher system, you must register your software
                  license. [1]

                  The license registration information you need is contained in the
                  Product Authorization Key (PAK) that is shipped with VAX FMS. The
                  PAK is a paper certificate that contains information about the
                  license you own to run a particular piece of software.

                  During the installation, you are asked if you have registered the
                  VAX FMS license and loaded the appropriate authorization key. You
                  must register and load your license for VAX FMS before you start
                  the installation in order to run the IVP and use the software.
               _____________________
             [1] VAX FMS can be installed without registering the FMS license.
                 However, the IVP is not executed without a license registration.
                 In addition, the FMS utilities and applications using the form
                 driver are not run until a license is properly registered.

               1-2  Preparing to Install VAX FMS

 












                  To register a license under VMS Version 5.0, first log in to the
                  system manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice of two
                  ways to perform the registration:

                   o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it prompts
                     you for information, respond with data from your Product
                     Authorization Key (PAK).

                   o  Issue the DCL command LICENSE REGISTER with the qualifiers that
                     correspond to information on the PAK.

                  For complete information on using LMF, see the manual on the
                  License Management Utility in the VMS documentation set.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5  Installation Procedure Requirements

                  The following sections discuss various requirements for installing
                  VAX FMS.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5.1  Restrictions

                  No users should be logged into the system while you are installing
                  FMS. You can use the REPLY command to send a message to users, for
                  example:

                    $ REPLY/ALL "Please log off now. Installing FMS."

                  If VMSINSTAL detects any users on the system, it gives you an
                  opportunity to stop the installation procedure by prompting you to
                  continue. If you want to stop the installation, press the RETURN
                  key.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5.2  Time

                  The installation takes approximately 15 to 60 minutes, depending
                  on the type of media and your system configuration.

                  Installing VAX FMS and running the IVP on a standalone VAXstation
                  II system takes 17 minutes.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5.3  Privileges

                  To install VAX FMS, you must be logged into an account that has
                  SETPRV or at least the following privileges:

                   o  CMKRNL

                   o  WORLD

                   o  SYSPRV

                  Note that VMSINSTAL turns off BYPASS privilege at the start of the
                  installation.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5.4  Disk Space

                  Installing VAX FMS requires a certain amount of free disk space
                  during the installation. Once VAX FMS is installed, less storage
                  space is required. Table 1-1 summarizes the storage requirements
                  for VAX FMS.

               1.5.5  System Parameters

                  Installing VAX FMS requires certain system parameter settings.
                  Table 1-2 lists the minimum required system parameter values
                  for the installation. Depending on the kinds of programs and
                  applications running at your site, you might need higher values
                  for some settings.

                  Table 1-2: Required System Parameter Values
                  __________________________________________________________________

                  __________________________________________________________________
                  [1]The n variable refers to the system parameter values that are
                  currently in use. To install VAX FMS, you must raise those values
                  by the number indicated. (See Section 1.5.5.2.)
                  __________________________________________________________________

                  The following sections show you how to check system parameter
                  values, calculate values for the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS system
                  parameters, and change parameter values with the VMS AUTOGEN
                  command procedure.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5.5.1  Checking System Parameter Values
                  To check the values of your system parameters, enter the following
                  command at the DCL prompt to invoke the System Generation Utility:

                    $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
                    SYSGEN>

                  At the SYSGEN> prompt, enter the SHOW command to display the value
                  of a system parameter. The values displayed should equal or exceed
                  the the value of each parameter listed in Table 1-2. The following
                  command displays the value for the GBLPAGES system parameter:

                    SYSGEN> SHOW GBLPAGES

                  After you finish checking the parameters with the SHOW command,
                  you can enter the EXIT command at the SYSGEN> prompt to return to
                  DCL level.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5.5.2  Calculating the Values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS
                  To install and run VAX FMS, you must set the correct values for
                  the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS system parameters.

                  The n shown in the Table 1-2 represents the current number of
                  unused global pages or global sections available on your system.
                  For the installation to execute successfully, you must raise these
                  values by the amount indicated. To calculate how many unused
                  global pages and global sections your system has, perform the
                  following steps:

                   1. Run the VMS Install Utility (INSTALL) using the following DCL
                     command:

                       $ INSTALL LIST /GLOBAL /SUMMARY

                     The Install Utility displays a summary of global pages and
                     global sections used by your system, as well as the current
                     number of unused global pages. For example:

                                        Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

                       258 Global Sections Used,  22580/3420 Global Pages Used/Unused

                   2. Determine if the number of unused global pages (3420 in the
                     example) is equal to or greater than 250. If the number of
                     unused pages is less than 250, you need to increase the value
                     for GBLPAGES.

                   3. Note the amount shown for Global Sections Used (258 in the
                     example).

                   4. Run the System Generation Utility and use the SHOW command to
                     determine how many global sections have been allocated. For
                     example:

                       $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
                       SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS

                       Parameter Name        Current   Default   Minimum   Maximum Unit  Dynamic
                       --------------        -------   -------   -------   ------- ----  -------
                       GBLSECTIONS               512       250        20      4095 Sections

                   5. Subtract the amount shown in the summary (258 in the example)
                     from the amount allocated. If the difference is less than 4,
                     you need to increase the value of the GBLSECTIONS parameter.

                  Section 1.5.5.3 describes the procedures for increasing these
                  values as well as those of other system parameters. Refer to the
                  VMS documentation on system management and operations for more
                  information.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5.5.3  Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN
                  You use the AUTOGEN command procedure to change system parameters.
                  AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for parameters that are
                  associated with the ones you reset manually. To change system
                  parameters with AUTOGEN, you must edit the the following file:

                    SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

                  Use an editor to access the file. If you need to change a param-
                  eter value that is already in the SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT file,
                  simply delete the current value associated with that parameter and
                  enter the new value.

                  To add a new value, add a line to the MODPARAMS.DAT file. The line
                  contains the name of the parameter and its value. For example:

                    GBLSECTIONS = 128

                  You can also modify incremental parameters in the MODPARAMS.DAT
                  file. The following example increases the global page setting by
                  2000:

                    ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000

                  After you have made all your changes, run the AUTOGEN procedure to
                  recalculate your system parameters. Enter the following command at
                  the DCL prompt:

                    $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

                  AUTOGEN performs an automatic system shutdown and reboots when it
                  has finished. Rebooting your system makes the new parameter values
                  active.

                  When you reboot a system under VMS Version 5.0, the Autogen
                  Utility automatically adjusts some of the SYSGEN parameters based
                  on the consumption of resources since the last reboot. If you do
                  not want to take advantage of this automatic adjustment, include
                  the /NOFEEDBACK qualifier on the AUTOGEN command line.

                  For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the instructions
                  on modifying system parameters in the VMS documentation on system
                  management and operations.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5.6  Process Account Quotas

                  The account you use to install VAX FMS must have sufficient quotas
                  to enable you to perform the installation. Table 1-3 summarizes
                  the process quotas required for the installation account.

                  Table 1-3: Process Account Quotas for the Installing Account
                  __________________________________________________________________
                  Account_Quota____Value____________________________________________
                  ASTLM            24

                  BIOLM            18

                  BYTLM            18,000

                  DIOLM            18

                  ENQLM            30

                  FILLM            20
                  __________________________________________________________________

                  User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT. You use the
                  VMS Authorize Utility to verify and change user account quotas.
                  First set your directory to SYS$SYSTEM and then run AUTHORIZE:

                    $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
                    $ RUN AUTHORIZE
                    UAF>

                  At the Authorize Utility prompt (UAF>), use the SHOW command with
                  an account name to check a particular account. For example:

                    UAF> SHOW SMITH

                  To change a quota, use the MODIFY command at the UAF> prompt.
                  MODIFY has the following format:

                        MODIFY account-name /quota-name=nnnn



               1-8  Preparing to Install VAX FMS

 












                  The following example changes the FILLM quota for the SMITH ac-
                  count and then exits from the Authorize Utility:

                    UAF> MODIFY SMITH /FILLM=50
                    UAF> EXIT

                  After you exit from the utility, the VMS system displays messages
                  indicating whether or not changes were made. Once the changes have
                  been made, you must log out and log in again for the new quotas to
                  take effect.

                  For more information on modifying account quotas, see the descrip-
                  tion of the Authorize Utility in the VMS documentation set.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5.7  VMSINSTAL Requirements

                  When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

                   o  Whether you have set your default device and directory to
                     SYS$UPDATE

                   o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account

                   o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation

                   o  Whether DECnet is up and running

                   o  Whether any users are logged in to the system

                  VMSINSTAL requires that the installation account have a minimum of
                  the following quotas:

                     ASTLM = 24
                     BIOLM = 18
                     BYTLM = 18,000
                     DIOLM = 18
                     ENQLM = 30
                     FILLM = 20

                  If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation, it
                  notifies you of the problem and asks if you want to continue the
                  installation. In some instances, you can enter YES to continue. To
                  stop the installation process and correct the situation, enter
                  NO or press RETURN. Then correct the problem and restart the
                  installation.

               ____________________________________________________________
               1.5.8  Backing Up Your System Disk

                  At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if you have
                  backed up your system disk. DIGITAL recommends that you do a
                  system disk backup before installing any software on top of the
                  operating system.

                  Use the backup procedures that have been established at your site.
                  For details on performing a system disk backup, see the section on
                  the Backup Utility in the VMS documentation set.

                                                                  Installing VAX FMS
               _____________________________________________________________________



                  This chapter describes how to install VAX FMS. Section 2.2 con-
                  tains a step-by-step description of the installation procedure.

               ____________________________________________________________
               2.1  General Information

                  This section includes information about accessing release notes,
                  determining files and logical names added to your system, running
                  the IVP, and aborting the installation.

               ____________________________________________________________
               2.1.1  Accessing the Online Release Notes

                  VAX FMS provides online release notes. You must specify OPTIONS N
                  when you invoke VMSINSTAL if you want the installation procedure
                  to give you an opportunity to display or print the online release
                  notes. This question comes near the beginning of the installation.

                  You should review the release notes in case they contain any in-
                  formation about changes in the installation procedure. If you have
                  already reviewed the release notes, you do not need to specify
                  OPTIONS N.

                  Once VAX FMS has been installed, the release notes are located in
                  the following file:

                    SYS$HELP:VAXFMS024.RELEASE_NOTES






                                                             Installing VAX FMS  2-1

 












                  Online help also directs you to the release notes file. After the
                  installation, you can enter the following command to review the
                  release notes through the HELP Facility:

                    $ HELP FMS RELEASE_NOTES

               ____________________________________________________________
               2.1.2  Determining the Files and Logical Names Added to the System

                  The files added, replaced, or modified on your system when VAX FMS
                  is installed are listed in Appendix C. They can also be found in
                  Appendix A of the online release notes.

                  VAX FMS adds only one logical name--FMS$EXAMPLES--to the system
                  when it is installed. The files associated with FMS$EXAMPLES
                  are listed in Appendix C as well as in Appendix A of the online
                  release notes.

               ____________________________________________________________
               2.1.3  Running the Installation Verification Procedure

                  The IVP for VAX FMS verifies the installation. During the in-
                  stallation, you are asked if you want to run the IVP as part of
                  the installation. If you respond YES, VMSINSTAL runs the IVP. It
                  is recommended that you run the IVP to be sure that VAX FMS is
                  installed correctly.

                  After VAX FMS is installed, you can run the IVP independently to
                  verify that the software is available on your system. You might
                  also want to run the IVP after a system failure to be sure that
                  users can access VAX FMS.

                  Because of their interactive nature, the Form editor and the Form
                  Tester must be tested manually on a VT100- or VT200-compatible
                  terminal. To verify the installation of the Form Editor and Form
                  Tester, see the procedure explained in Chapter 4.

               ____________________________________________________________
               2.1.4  Aborting the Installation

                  To abort the installation procedure at any time, press CTRL/Y.
                  When you press CTRL/Y, the installation procedure deletes all
                  files it has created up to that point and exits. You can then
                  start the installation again.

               2.2  The Installation Procedure

                  The VAX FMS installation procedure consists of a series of ques-
                  tions and informational messages. The following sections explain
                  how to invoke VMSINSTAL and answer the installation procedure
                  questions.

               2.2.1  Invoking VMSINSTAL

                  To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command procedure
                  from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM account. VMSINSTAL
                  is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. You use the following syntax to
                  invoke VMSINSTAL:

                        @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL product-name device-name OPTIONS N

                  product-name
                  The installation name for the component. For VAX FMS, use the
                  following installation name:

                        VAXFMS024

                  device-name
                  The name of the device on which you plan to mount the media. For
                  example, MTA0: is the device name for a tape drive. It is not
                  necessary to use the console drive for this installation. However,
                  if you do use the console drive, you should replace any media you
                  removed once the installation is complete.

                  OPTIONS N
                  An optional parameter that indicates you want to be see the re-
                  lease notes question. If you do not include the OPTIONS N pa-
                  rameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about the release notes.
                  You should review the release notes before proceeding with the
                  installation in case they contain new information about the in-
                  stallation.

                  There are several other options you can select when you invoke
                  VMSINSTAL. See the VMS documentation on software installation for
                  information on these options.

                  The following example displays the command to invoke VMSINSTAL
                  to install VAX FMS from tape drive MTA0: and shows the system
                  response. This example uses the OPTIONS N release note parameter.

                    It is 14-NOV-1988 at 10:15.
                    Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

                  If you do not supply either the product name or the device name,
                  VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information later on in the instal-
                  lation procedure. VMSINSTAL does not prompt you for any options,
                  so be sure to include OPTIONS N on the VMSINSTAL command line to
                  access the release notes during the installation.

               ____________________________________________________________
               2.2.2  Installation Questions

                  This section discusses the questions that appear during the in-
                  stallation. Appendix A contains a sample installation procedure
                  showing how the questions can be answered.

                  Each question in the installation is marked with an asterisk (*)
                  at the beginning of the line. Some questions show the default
                  response in brackets, for example [YES]. If you want to use the
                  default response, press the RETURN key.

                   1. DECnet status

                     VMSINSTAL notifies you if DECnet is running and displays a list
                     of all active processes. It then asks if you want to continue
                     the installation. You should install VAX FMS on a standalone
                     system or cluster with DECnet shut down. NO is the default
                     response to the question.

                       %VMSINSTAL-W-DECNET, Your DECnet network is up and running.
                          .
                          .
                          .
                       * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

                   2. System backup

                     VMSINSTAL asks if you are satisfied with your system backup.
                     You should always back up your system disk before performing
                     an installation. If you are satisfied with the backup of your
                     system disk, press RETURN. Otherwise, enter NO to discontinue
                     the installation. After you back up your system disk, you can
                     restart the installation.

                       * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                   3. Mounting the media

                     You should now mount the first distribution volume on the de-
                     vice you specified when you invoked VMSINSTAL. The device name
                     appears in the line preceding the question "Are you ready?".
                     VMSINSTAL then asks you if you are ready to continue with the
                     installation.
                     If you respond YES to indicate that you are ready, VMSINSTAL
                     displays a message that the media containing VAX FMS has been
                     mounted on the specified device and that the installation has
                     begun. For example:

                       Please mount the first volume of the set on MTA0:.
                       * Are you ready? YES
                       %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, VAX FMS MOUNTED ON _$$MTA0:
                       The following products will be processed:
                         VAX FMS V2.4

                           Beginning installation of VAX FMS V2.4 at 10:30

                       %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

                     If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked VMSINSTAL
                     and need to restart the installation, enter NO in response to
                     the "Are you ready?" question. To abort the installation for
                     other reasons, press CTRL/Y.

                   4. Release Notes

                     If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL, you are
                     now asked to choose one of the five options for reviewing the
                     release notes.





                                                             Installing VAX FMS  2-5

 












                       Release Notes Options:

                        1.  Display release notes
                        2.  Print release notes
                        3.  Both 1 and 2
                        4.  Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
                        5.  Do not display, print or copy release notes

                       * Select option [2]:

                     If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release notes
                     immediately on your terminal. You can terminate the display at
                     any time by pressing CTRL/C.
                     If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for the name of
                     the print queue that you want to use:

                       * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                     You can press RETURN to send the file to the default output
                     print device or you can enter another queue name.
                     If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release notes
                     immediately on the console terminal and then prompts you for a
                     queue name for the printed version.
                     Option 4 causes the installation to copy the release notes to
                     the help directory. Even if you do not select option 4, the
                     release notes for VAX FMS are copied to the SYS$HELP directory.
                     Select option 5 if you have already reviewed the release notes.

                   5. Continuing the installation

                     The installation procedure now asks if you want to continue the
                     installation. To continue, enter YES. Otherwise, press RETURN.
                     In either case, the release notes are copied to a file in the
                     SYS$HELP directory. For example:

                       * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES
                       %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been
                       successfully moved to SYS$HELP.

                     The release notes are located in the following file:

                       SYS$HELP:VAXFMS024.RELEASE_NOTES

                                                   NOTE

                         The name of the release notes file installed by
                         VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name and ver-

                         sion number. Do not delete release notes for previous
                         versions of VAX FMS.

                   6. License Registration

                     The installation procedure displays license information about
                     your product and then asks if you have registered and loaded
                     your authorization key for VAX FMS. For example:

                       Product:       VAX FMS
                       Producer:      DEC
                       Version:       2.4
                       Release Date:  14-NOV-1988

                       * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

                     If you have not registered and loaded your authorization key,
                     you must answer NO to this question. You have to register and
                     load your product authorization key to successfully complete
                     the installation. If you have not done so, you should stop the
                     installation, register and load your product authorization key,
                     and then restart the installation.

                   7. Choosing to run the IVP

                     The installation procedure now asks if you want to run the
                     Installation Verification Procedure. The IVP for VAX FMS checks
                     to be sure that the installation is successful. It is recom-
                     mended that you run the IVP.

                       * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

                   8. Choosing to purge files

                     You have the option to purge files from previous versions of
                     VAX FMS that are superseded by this installation. Purging
                     is recommended; however, if you need to keep files from the
                     previous version, enter NO in response to the question.

                       * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

                   9. Installation Options

                     You are now asked to choose your installation options. If you
                     answer YES to the prompt, the VAX FMS modifiable message files
                     and sample applications are installed.




                                                             Installing VAX FMS  2-7

 












                       * Do you wish to install Sample Application Programs and Modifiable
                       Message File Procedures [YES]?

                     The Sample Application Programs are used throughout the
                     VAX FMS documentation as examples of VAX FMS programming
                     techniques. The files relating to the sample applications
                     are found in the FMS$EXAMPLES: directory and are listed in
                     Appendix C. The VAX FMS installation and start-up procedure
                     (SYS$STARTUP:FMSTARTUP.COM) defines a system logical for the
                     FMS$EXAMPLES: directory.
                     See Appendix A for more detailed information concerning the
                     Sample Application Programs.
                     The Modifiable Message File Procedure creates a subdirectory
                     containing the sources for the FMS Message Files and instruc-
                     tions on how to modify the text of the messages in the FMS Form
                     Driver and FMS Utilities. The message files are found in the
                     subdirectory SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.FMS.MESSAGE]. The
                     instructions for modifying the message files are in the FMS_
                     MESSAGE.MEM file in that subdirectory.

                   10.Additional media volumes

                     If your installation kit contains more than one volume,
                     VMSINSTAL prompts you to insert the additional volumes and then
                     asks you to indicate that you are ready for the installation to
                     proceed.

                       %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _MTA0: for reading

                       Enter "YES" when ready:

               2.2.3  Informational Messages

                  At this point, the installation procedure displays a number of
                  informational messages that report on the progress of the in-
                  stallation. There are no further questions. If the installation
                  procedure has been successful up to this point, VMSINSTAL moves
                  the new or modified files to their target directories, updates
                  help files, and updates DCL tables, if necessary. If you asked for
                  files to be purged, that is done now. The following messages are
                  displayed:

                    %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target directories...

                   o  SYS$SYSTEM:FMSFLI.EXE

                   o  SYS$SYSTEM:FMSFTE.EXE

                   o  SYS$SYSTEM:FMSFUU.EXE

                  In addition, the SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
                  files are updated to include the new version of the VAX FMS HELP
                  text and the FMS command line definition, respectively. The VAX
                  FMS release notes are copied to the SYS$HELP:VAXFMS024.RELEASE_
                  NOTES file.

                  For a complete list of files that have been created or modified by
                  the installation procedure, see Appendix C.

               2.2.4  Running the Installation Verification Procedure

                  If you chose to run the IVP, VMSINSTAL runs it now. You see the
                  following display:

                    Beginning VAX FMS V2.4 Installation Procedure...

                  If VAX FMS has been successfully installed, the IVP displays the
                  following message:

                    VAXFMS V2.4 Installation Verification Procedure was successful
                    Refer to the VAX FMS Installation Guide for further verification
                    procedures..

                  You can run the IVP separately any time after FMS has been in-
                  stalled. To run the IVP, use the following command:

                    @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS$TEST.FMS]VAXFMS$IVP






                                                             Installing VAX FMS  2-9

 











               ____________________________________________________________
               2.2.5  Completing the Installation Procedure

                  The following messages indicate that the entire installation
                  procedure is complete:

                       Installation of VAX FMS V2.4 completed at 11:03

                       VMSINSTAL procedure done at 11:17

                  You can now log out of the privileged account:

                    $ LOGOUT
                    SYSTEM     logged out at 14-NOV-1988 11:24:32.40

                  VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process symbol tables
                  during the installation. Therefore, if you are going to continue
                  using the system manager's account and you want to restore these
                  symbols, you should log out and log in again.

               ____________________________________________________________
               2.3  Error Recovery

                  If errors occur during the installation itself or when the IVP is
                  running, VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
                  fails, you see the following message:

                    %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of VAX FMS V2.4 has failed.

                  If the IVP fails, you see these messages:

                    The VAX FMS V2.4 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

                    %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for VAX FMS V2.4 has failed.

                  Errors can occur during the installation if any of the following
                  conditions exist:

                   o  The operating system version is incorrect.

                   o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are insufficient.

                   o  System parameter values for successful installation are insuf-
                     ficient.

                   o  The VMS help library is currently in use.

                   o  The product license has not been registered and loaded.

                  ditions, see the VMS documentation on system messages, recovery
                  procedures, and VMS software installation. If you are notified
                  that any of these conditions exist, you should take the appropri-
                  ate action as described in the message. (You might need to change
                  a system parameter or increase an authorized quota value.) For
                  information on installation requirements, see Chapter 1.

                                                                           Chapter 3


                                                            After Installing VAX FMS
               _____________________________________________________________________



                  After installing VAX FMS, you need to perform the following tasks:

                   o  Edit the system startup files.

                   o  Set user account quotas.


               ____________________________________________________________
               3.1  Editing the System Files

                  You must edit two system start-up files to provide for automatic
                  startup of VAX FMS when your system is rebooted:

                   1. Add the command line that starts VAX FMS to the system startup
                     file, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM. VAX FMS cannot start until
                     the network has started. You must position this new command
                     line after the line that invokes the network startup command
                     procedure. The following example shows the network startup
                     command line followed by the startup command line for VAX FMS:

                       $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
                            .
                            .
                            .
                       $ @SYS$STARTUP:FMSTARTUP.COM


                   2. The FMS start-up command procedure contains several VMS com-
                     mands. The first command assigns the logical name FMS$EXAMPLES
                     to the directory that contains the VAX FMS Version 2.4 Sample
                     Application Programs.


                                                       After Installing VAX FMS  3-1

 












                     The last commands in the command procedure install FDVSHR and
                     FDVMSG as known shared images. To improve the performance of
                     FMS application programs further, you can remove the following
                     line from FMSTARTUP.COM:

                       $ EXIT         ! Remove this line to install the images

                     If you have made any changes to the FMSTARTUP.COM file, use the
                     SHUTDOWN procedure to stop the current system, and rebootstrap
                     the system.


               ____________________________________________________________
               3.2  User Account Requirements

                  To work with VAX FMS, user accounts on your system must have
                  certain privileges and quotas. The next two sections contain
                  information on these requirements. The third section discusses
                  special requirements.

               ____________________________________________________________
               3.2.1  Privileges

                  To use VAX FMS, each account must have at least the TMPMBX priv-
                  ilege. Use the VMS Authorize Utility to determine whether users
                  have the privileges they require.

               ____________________________________________________________
               3.2.2  User Account Quotas

                  You must make sure that the appropriate user accounts have suffi-
                  cient quotas to be able to use VAX FMS. Table 3-1 summarizes the
                  required user account quotas.













               3-2  After Installing VAX FMS

 












                  Table 3-1: User Account Quotas for Using VAX FMS
                  __________________________________________________________________

                  BIOLM            18

                  DIOLM            18

                  ENQLM            30

                  FILLM            20
                  __________________________________________________________________

                  User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT. You use the
                  VMS Authorize Utility to verify and change user account quotas.
                  First set your directory to SYS$SYSTEM and then run AUTHORIZE:

                    $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
                    $ RUN AUTHORIZE
                    UAF>

                  At the Authorize Utility prompt (UAF>), enter the SHOW command
                  with an account name to check that particular account. For exam-
                  ple:

                    UAF> SHOW SMITH

                  To change a quota, use the MODIFY command at the UAF> prompt.
                  MODIFY has the following syntax:

                        MODIFY account-name /quota-name=nnnn

                  The following example changes the ENQLM quota for the SMITH ac-
                  count and then exits from the utility:

                    UAF> MODIFY SMITH /ENQLM=50
                    UAF> EXIT

                  After you exit from the utility, the VMS system displays messages
                  indicating whether or not changes were made. Once you have fin-
                  ished making the changes, the users must log out and log in again
                  for the new quotas to take effect.

                  For more information on modifying account quotas, see the descrip-
                  tion of the Authorize Utility in the VMS documentation set.

               ____________________________________________________________
               3.3  Running the IVP

                  When FMS is installed, the IVP is automatically placed in the fol-
                  lowing location: SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS$TEST.FMS]VAXFMS$IVP.COM. The
                  IVP is placed there even if you chose not to run it at installa-
                  tion time.

                  You can run the IVP at any time after FMS has been installed by
                  issuing the following command:

                    @SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS$TEST.FMS]VAXFMS$IVP

               ____________________________________________________________
               3.4  Special Requirements

                  To prevent data loss, users should set their terminals to HOSTSYNC
                  and TYPAHEAD before using VAX FMS. For more information, see the
                  online release notes.

               ____________________________________________________________
               3.5  Enhancing VAX FMS Performance

                  This section includes information on system tuning and explains
                  how to install VAX FMS as a shared image.

                  The VAX FMS Version 2.4 Form Driver is built as a shared image.
                  If several users who run FMS applications at the same time are
                  on your system, each user has a copy of the Form Driver in mem-
                  ory. If you install the Form Driver as a known shared image, the
                  users share a single copy of the Form Driver in memory when FMS
                  applications are run.

                  A known shared image reduces memory requirements and can improve
                  system performance.

                  To install VAX FMS as a known shared image on a system that is
                  currently running, use the VMS Install Utility (INSTALL). It is
                  recommended that you perform the install operation on a system
                  that has just been bootstrapped because the available space in the
                  global page table is less likely to be fragmented.






               3-4  After Installing VAX FMS

 












                  To install VAX FMS as a shared image, first, determine the number
                  of available global pages and global sections on your system. See
                  Section 1.5.5.2 for information on how to verify and modify the
                  number of global pages and global sections. Table 1-2 contains the
                  required values for these parameters.

                  Once you have reset the system parameter values, invoke the VMS
                  Install Utility from a privileged account and then install VAX FMS
                  as a shared image:

                    $ INSTALL
                    INSTALL> ADD SYS$SHARE:FDVSHR.EXE /OPEN /SHARED
                    INSTALL> ADD SYS$MESSAGE:FDVMSG.EXE /OPEN /SHARED
                    INSTALL> EXIT

                  You must now add the following lines to the appropriate system
                  startup command file so that each time the system is started, VAX
                  FMS is available as a shared image. (If your site has modularized
                  its startup procedures, be sure you add the lines to the correct
                  file. The default startup command file for VMS Version 5.0 is
                  SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM.)

                    $ INSTALL
                    INSTALL> ADD SYS$SHARE:FDVSHR.EXE /OPEN /SHARED
                    INSTALL> ADD SYS$MESSAGEFDVMSG.EXE /OPEN /SHARED
                    INSTALL> EXIT

                  When you install VAX FMS as a shared image you need to increase
                  the global pages and global sections parameters. Increase global
                  pages (GBLPAGES) by 250 pages and global sections (GBLSECTIONS)
                  by 4 sections. Refer to Section 1.5.5 for information on changing
                  these parameters.

               ____________________________________________________________
               3.6  Determining and Reporting Problems

                  If an error occurs while VAX FMS is being used and you believe
                  that the error is caused by a problem with VAX FMS, take one of
                  the following actions:

                   o  If you have a BASIC or DECsupport Software Agreement, you
                     should call your Customer Support Center. With these services,
                     you receive telephone support that provides high-level advisory
                     and remedial assistance.

                   o  If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement, you can
                     submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

                   o  If you purchased VAX FMS within the past 90 days and you think
                     the problem is caused by a software error, you can submit a
                     Software Performance Report (SPR).

                  If you find an error in the VAX FMS documentation, you should
                  fill out and submit the Reader's Comments form at the back of the
                  document in which the error occurred. Include the section and page
                  number where the error occurred.

                                           Verifying the Form Editor and Form Tester
               _____________________________________________________________________



                  Because of their interactive nature, the Form Editor and the Form
                  Tester must be tested manually on a VT100- or VT200-compatible
                  terminal. The following procedure verifies the installation of the
                  Form Editor and the Form Tester.

                   1. Log in using a VT100- or VT200-compatible terminal.

                   2. Create a form to test the Form Editor.

                     Issue the SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE command to request a response
                     sequence from your terminal. To create a form, specify the name
                     of a file that does not exist in the current directory. (In
                     this example, the file is called testfile.frm.) The default
                     file type is .FRM.

                       $  SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE
                       $  FMS/EDIT testfile.frm

                   3. Select a Form Editor Menu option.

                     After you have entered the Form Editor, select LAYOUT at the
                     Phase Choice prompt. The screen is cleared and the Layout Phase
                     status line appears at the bottom of your screen.

                       Phase Choice: LAYOUT

                   4. Type some text. For example:

                       This is a test of FMS.

                     You have just entered text into your form. If you want to enter
                     field mode, press the PF1 key and then the keypad 8 key. Type
                     the letter x six times to indicate a field. For example:

               <PF1>
                        <KP8>
                       XXXXXX

                   5. Exit the Form Editor.

                     Press the PF1 key and the keypad 7 key to exit from the Layout
                     Phase of the Form Editor. The Form Editor Menu reappears; at
                     the prompt, type EXIT and press RETURN.

               <PF1>
                        <KP7>
                       Phase Choice: EXIT

                   6. Save the form.

                     After you have exited Layout Phase, the Editor prompts you to
                     save the file. Press RETURN to save the form.

                       $ Do you want to save this form?
                        %FMS-I-FORMSAVED, Form testfile.frm saved in testfile.frm

                   7. Test the form.

                       $FMS/TEST testfile.frm

                     FMS displays your form. Type any seven characters. Note that
                     the seventh character does not echo on the screen. The terminal
                     bell rings and an error message indicating that the field is
                     full is displayed at the bottom of your terminal screen. Press
                     RETURN. The system prompt appears.

                       123456
               <RETURN>

                       $

                   8. Delete the form file.

                       $ DELETE testfile.frm;*

                     The test is complete. If any errors occurred during the test,
                     follow the instructions in Section 2.3.

               _____________________________________________________________________



                  This appendix contains sample installations of VAX FMS. These
                  samples were run on a system that had no previous version of VAX
                  FMS installed.

                  The sample installation assumes that DECnet has been shut down,
                  that no users are logged on to your system, and that OPTIONS
                  N is specified to print the release notes. The Installation
                  Verification Procedure (IVP) runs at the end of the installation.

                                              Using the Sample Applications Programs
               _____________________________________________________________________



                  The VAX FMS Version 2.4 installation and start-up procedure
                  SYS$STARTUP:FMSTARTUP.COM defines a system logical name for the
                  FMS$EXAMPLES: directory. This directory contains files relating to
                  the VAX FMS Version 2.4 Sample Application Programs.

                  If you are planning to run the Sample Application Programs on a
                  bisynchronous terminal, refer to Section B.2.

                  VAX FMS Version 2.4 provides the Sample Application Programs
                  listed in Table B-1.

                    $ RUN FMS$EXAMPLES:SAMP

                  If, while you are running the Sample Application Program, you
                  choose to write checks, a data file called SAMPCH.DAT is created
                  in your default directory when you press the PF4 key to write the
                  check.

               ____________________________________________________________
               B.1  Files Associated with the Sample Application Programs

                  Files that help you generate the Sample Application Program are
                  included in the FMS$EXAMPLES: directory. These files are as fol-
                  lows:

                   o  Files associated with SAMP forms
                     The Sample Application Program forms are stored in a form
                     library, SAMP.FLB.
                     Two additional forms are provided to successfully run the
                     Sample Application on either a bisynchronous terminal or a
                     MicroVAX Workstation. The forms are contained in the files
                     BISYNC_REGIST.FRM and LONG_REGIST.FRM, and are designed to re-
                     place the REGISTER form in the Sample Application form library,
                     SAMP.FLB. The BISYNC_REGIST.FRM file enables you to run the
                     Sample Application successfully on a bisynchronous terminal.
                     The LONG_REGIST.FRM enables you to produce and display 55-line
                     forms on MicroVAX Workstations.

                   o  Files produced by the FMS Application Aids
                     The memory-resident form file, SMPMEMRES.OBJ, and the UAR
                     vector file, SMPVECTOR.OBJ, are included in a link command
                     to produce an executable SAMP image.

                   o  SAMP data base file
                     The SAMP.DAT file provides the account data for the Sample
                     Application Programs.

                   o  Source files that contain FMS definitions (see Table B-2)
                     The FMS definition files provide definitions for Form Driver
                     symbols used in the Sample Application Programs. Many of these
                     files are used directly by the appropriate language construct
                     (INCLUDE, COPY, REQUIRE, ENVIRONMENT, and so forth) to define
                     the symbols in the programs. You may want to use these files as
                     examples that you can tailor to fit your own applications.

                  __________________________________________________________________

                   o  Additional source files for languages (see Table B-3)
                     Some of the Sample Application Programs have source files con-
                     taining convenient definitions that relate only to a particular
                     language.

               B.2  Running the Sample Application on Bisynchronous Terminals

                  If you do not plan to run the Sample Application Programs on
                  bisynchronous terminals, you can skip this section.

                  The Sample Application Programs can be run on bisynchronous ter-
                  minals with no modifications to the programs. Because of the
                  bisynchronous terminal's width restrictions, a form modifica-
                  tion is required. The form that is used on asynchronous terminals
                  (VT52, VT100, VT2xx, and so forth) to display the check register,
                  REGISTER, will not fit on a bisynchronous terminal screen.

                  The FMS Version 2.4 kit provides a replacement form for REGISTER
                  that will fit on the bisynchronous terminal screen. This form will
                  work on aysnchronous terminals as well. The form is contained in
                  the form file named BISYNC_REGIST.FRM located in FMS$EXAMPLES:.

                  Before running the Sample Application Programs on bisynchronous
                  terminals, follow these steps to replace the REGISTER form in the
                  Sample Application form library, SAMP.FLB:

                   1. Log into the system manager's account.

                   2. Type the following FMS DCL command to save the current REGISTER
                     form in a form file named FMS$EXAMPLES:REGISTER.FRM.

                       $ FMS/LIBRARY/EXTRACT-
                       _$ FMS$EXAMPLES:SAMP/FORM=REGISTER/OUTPUT=FMS$EXAMPLES:REGISTER.FRM


                   3. Type the following FMS DCL command to insert the new REGISTER
                     form.

                       $ FMS/LIBRARY/REPLACE FMS$EXAMPLES:SAMP FMS$EXAMPLES:BISYNC_REGIST

                  After successfully executing this command, the Sample Application
                  Programs may be run as documented here on either asynchronous or
                  bisynchronous terminals.

                  The REGISTER form now has a different appearance and different
                  field attributes than those of the original REGISTER form doc-
                  umented in Introduction to VAX-11 FMS. These differences are
                  required so that the form will fit on the bisynchronous termi-
                  nal screen. These differences will have no effect on the form's
                  function or interaction with the program.

               B.3  Running the Sample Application on MicroVAX Workstations

                  If you do not plan to run the Sample Application Programs on
                  MicroVAX Workstations, you can skip this section.

                  The Sample Application Programs can be run on MicroVAX Workstations
                  with no modifications to the programs. However, to take advan-
                  tage of the increased size of the VT100 and VT200 windows on the
                  Workstation, a modification has been made to one of the forms
                  in the Sample Application. The REGISTER form, which contains a
                  scrolled region to display the check register, has been modified
                  to take advantage of a 55-line window. The FMS Version 2.4 kit
                  provides this form in the file named LONG_REGIST.FRM, located in
                  FMS$EXAMPLES:.

                  To take advantage of the 55-line Workstation window, follow these
                  steps to replace the REGISTER form in the Sample Application form
                  library, SAMP.FLB:

                   1. Log in to the system manager's account.

                   2. Type the following FMS DCL command to save the current REGISTER
                     form in a form file named FMS$EXAMPLES:REGISTER.FRM.

                       $ FMS/LIBRARY/EXTRACT-
                       _$ FMS$EXAMPLES:SAMP/FORM=REGISTER/OUTPUT=FMS$EXAMPLES:REGISTER.FRM

                   3. Type the following FMS DCL command to insert the new REGISTER
                     form.

                       $ FMS/LIBRARY/REPLACE FMS$EXAMPLES:SAMP FMS$EXAMPLES:LONG_REGIST

                   4. Type the following DCL command to set the Workstation window
                     size to 55 lines.

                       $ SET TERMINAL/PAGE=55

                  After successfully executing this command, the Sample Application
                  Programs may be run as documented on a MicroVAX Workstation.

                  The Sample Application will not run on standard terminals (VT52,
                  VT100, VT2xx, and so forth) with the form LONG_REGIST in the form
                  library, SAMP.FLB.
