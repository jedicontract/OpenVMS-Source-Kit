              This manual explains how to install and configure the
              DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (UCX) networking
              software on an OpenVMS system.

        Intended Audience

              This manual is intended for OpenVMS system managers or
              network managers who install and configure networking
              software. The system managers using this book should have
              an understanding of TCP/IP networks and terminology.

        Document Structure

              This manual contains three chapters and one appendix:

              o  Chapter 1 outlines the tasks involved in getting the
                 UCX software running successfully on your system and
                 explains how to prepare for installing and configuring
                 Version 4.2 of UCX.

              o  Chapter 2 describes how to install Version 4.2 of the
                 UCX software using the POLYCENTER Software Installation
                 utility (OpenVMS Alpha) and the VMSINSTAL procedure
                 (OpenVMS VAX).

              o  Chapter 3 provides guidelines on how to configure the
                 UCX components and services after you have installed
                 the software successfully.

              o  Appendix A lists the locations of files installed
                 on your OpenVMS system during the UCX installation
                 procedure.


                                                                       v

                                  Preparing to Install and Configure UCX



              This chapter explains how to prepare for installing and
              configuring DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version
              4.2 software (hereafter called UCX).

        1.1 Understanding the Major Tasks Involved

              Once you familiarize yourself with the UCX product and
              decide the components and functionality you want to
              enable, installing and configuring the software is a
              simple process that generally takes less than one hour
              to complete.

              Table 1-1 lists the major tasks involved in installing and
              configuring the UCX software.

     Preparing to Install and Configure UCX
     1.1 Understanding the Major Tasks Involved

           You should allow additional time for running tests to
           verify the configuration and for follow-on configuration
           and setup tasks. The time required to complete these tasks
           will vary.

           If you are upgrading from a previous version, you need
           to run the SYS$UPDATE:UCX$CLEANUP_HELPLIB.COM procedure
           to delete obsolete commands from the top-level online
           help. Running this procedure generally takes an additional
           few minutes; the instructions are displayed in the
           installation script.

     1.2 Preinstallation Tasks

           The following sections summarize important tasks you need
           to complete before you install the UCX software on your
           system.

     1.2.1 Inspecting the Distribution Kit

           Make sure you have a complete software distribution kit.
           If you have the OpenVMS consolidated distribution CD-
           ROM distribution kit, check the CD master index for the
           kit location. If you have a magnetic tape or TK50 kit,
           supply the device name when requested by the software
           installation procedure.

           Check that the kit contains everything listed on the bill
           of materials (BOM). If anything is missing or damaged,
           contact your DIGITAL representative.

     1.2.2 Registering the UCX License Product Authorization Key

           Before you install the UCX software on a newly licensed
           node or cluster, you must register a License Product
           Authorization Key (PAK) using the OpenVMS License
           Management Facility (LMF). Without a PAK, you can use
           only DECwindows TCP/IP Transport software.

           If you are installing the UCX software as an update on
           a node or cluster already licensed for this software,
           you have already completed the License PAK registration
           requirements.

                                               1.2 Preinstallation Tasks

              If you ordered the license and the media together, the
              PAK is included with your distribution kit. Otherwise, the
              PAK is shipped separately to the location specified on the
              license order.

              If you are installing prerequisite or optional software
              along with the UCX software, review the PAK status and
              install the PAKs for any prerequisite or optional software
              before you install UCX.

              To register a license, log into the system manager's
              account, SYSTEM, and do one of the following:

              o  Run the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM file and enter the
                 data from your License PAK.

              o  At the DCL prompt, issue the LICENSE REGISTER command
                 and the appropriate qualifiers.

              You must register a license for each node in an OpenVMS
              Cluster.

              For complete information about LMF, see the <REFERENCE>(VMS_
              LICENSE).

        1.2.3 Upgrading OpenVMS and Backing Up the System Disk

              Before you install the UCX software, DIGITAL recommends
              that you upgrade the OpenVMS operating system, if
              applicable, then back up the system disk using the backup
              procedures established at your site.

              For information about how to install OpenVMS, refer to the
              appropriate OpenVMS upgrade and installation manual.

              For information about backing up a system disk, see the
              <REFERENCE>(VMS_SYSMAN1).

        1.2.4 Checking the Disk Space

              Make sure the system meets the following disk space
              requirements (block cluster size = 1):

           Disk space for        32,000 blocks (Alpha)
           product_use___________18,000_(VAX)________________________

           The actual disk space needed will vary depending on the
           system environment, configuration, and software options.

           To find out how many free blocks exist on the system disk,
           enter the following command:

           $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

     1.2.5 Checking the Memory

           Make sure the system meets the following memory require-
           ments:

           __________________________________________________________
           System________________Minimum_Memory______________________

           OpenVMS VAX           24 MB

           OpenVMS_Alpha_________32_MB_______________________________

           To check the memory, enter the following command:

           $ SHOW MEMORY/FULL

     1.2.6 Changing the System Parameters

           Most systems have adequate system resources readily
           available to include the UCX software. However, you
           should check the system parameters outlined in the
           following sections and make any necessary changes to
           the MODPARAMS.DAT file, then use AUTOGEN to reboot your
           system.

     1.2.6.1 Global Pagelets and Global Sections

           The UCX software requires 65 global sections and 8100
           global pagelets.

           To check the number of available global pagelets and
           global sections, issue WRITE commands with the F$GETSYI
           lexical functions. For example:

                                  Preparing to Install and Configure UCX
                                               1.2 Preinstallation Tasks

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")
              1234

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")
              189

              To increase the global pagelets and global sections, add
              statements to the MODPARAMS.DAT file that increase the
              values of the system parameters GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS.

        1.2.6.2 Nonpaged Dynamic Pool

              Add at least 350,000 bytes of nonpaged dynamic pool (the
              default maximum size for the UCX software), as follows:

              1. Log into the SYSTEM account.

              2. Identify the amount of additional nonpaged pool your
                 system requires. Use the default initial value of
                 342,000 or use the following formula and table to
                 calculate the amount of NPAGEDYN required:

                 nonpaged pool = socket*1280+dbuf*1792+cbuf*256+mtusers*700+mrusers*700

                 _______________________________________________________
                 Variable___Definition__________________________________

                 socket     Maximum number of sockets. (A socket
                            system call creates an end point for
                            communication.)

                 dbuf       Maximum number of data buffers.

                 cbuf       Maximum number of control buffers.

                 mtusers    Maximum number of TELNET users.

                 mrusers____Maximum_number_of_remote_login_users._______

              3. Refer to the following example, then edit the
                 MODPARAMS.DAT file to reflect the newly calculated
                 value for the NPAGEDYN and NPAGEVIR parameters:

                 ! Add nonpaged pool for UCX.
                 !
                 ADD_NPAGEDYN=342000
                 ADD_NPAGEVIR=342000

              For more information about nonpaged dynamic pool, see the
              <REFERENCE>(VMS_SYSMAN1).

     1.2.6.3 Interrupt Stack Pages (OpenVMS VAX Only)

           If you are using PATHWORKS Internet Protocol (PWIP) on
           an OpenVMS VAX system, you should increase the number of
           interrupt stack pages (INTSTKPAGES) to 10 or more to help
           eliminate system startup and system crash warnings.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              For information about PATHWORKS, see the PATHWORKS
              documentation. For a list of PATHWORKS files
              that the UCX installation procedure copies, see
              Table A-2.

              _____________________________________________________

           To increase the number of INTSTKPAGES, add statements
           to the MODPARAMS.DAT file that increase the value of the
           SYSGEN and INTSTKPAGES parameters.

     1.2.7 Assigning User Identification Codes

           An OpenVMS user or group of users are identified by a
           unique, assigned user identification code (UIC) in the
           format [group,member], where group and member are numeric
           or alphanumeric characters. For example, a UIC can be
           either [306,210], [GROUP1, JONES], or simply JONES. The
           UIC is linked to a system-defined rights database that
           determines user and group privileges.

           The UCX configuration procedure uses the existing group
           UIC, if the UIC exists. If not, the octal number 375 (the
           default UIC group number for service accounts) is used. If
           this is an initial UCX configuration, but the procedure
           detects that 375 is in use, you will be prompted for a new
           UIC group number.

           Before you assign a new group number, check that the
           number you chose is not already in use by issuing the
           following commands (making sure to type the brackets):

           $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE

           UAF> SHOW /BRIEF [your_group_number,*]

           UAF> SHOW /IDENTIFIER /VALUE=UIC:[your_group_number,*]

              To specify a new UIC group number instead of using the
              default, assign the value TRUE to the logical name
              UCX$ASK_GROUP_UIC. The configuration procedure then
              prompts you for a group UIC.

                                                         Installing UCX



              This chapter explains how to install the UCX software
              using the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility
              (OpenVMS Alpha) or the VMSINSTAL procedure (OpenVMS VAX).

        2.1 Installing UCX on an OpenVMS Alpha System

              This section takes you through a UCX installation on
              an OpenVMS Alpha system using the POLYCENTER Software
              Installation utility. The instructions are appropriate for
              an initial product installation or a version upgrade.

              For complete information about the POLYCENTER Software
              Installation utility, refer to the <REFERENCE>(VMS_
              SYSMAN1).

        2.1.1 UCX Installation Procedure (OpenVMS Alpha)

              Install the UCX software on an OpenVMS Alpha system as
              follows. Note that the last step requires you to reboot
              the system to complete the installation.

              1. Complete the recommended preinstallation tasks outlined
                 in Chapter 1.

              2. Log into the SYSTEM account.

              3. If another version of the UCX software exists on your
                 system, shut down that version by issuing the following
                 command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:UCX$SHUTDOWN

              4. Check to ensure that no one is logged onto the system.

              5. Copy the UCX distribution kit into the SYS$SPECIFIC:[UCX42]
                 directory.

              6. Create a log file to record the installation or upgrade
                 procedure, if you want a copy for your records.

     Installing UCX
     2.1 Installing UCX on an OpenVMS Alpha System

           7. To start the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility,
              enter the PRODUCT INSTALL command with the directory
              path appropriate for your system. For example:

              $ PRODUCT INSTALL UCX /SOURCE=SYS$SPECIFIC:[UCX42]

              where SYS$SPECIFIC:[UCX42] is the directory path for
              the UCX kit.

              If you do not specify the source qualifier, the
              POLYCENTER utility searches the location defined by the
              logical name PCSI$SOURCE. If you do not specify either
              the source qualifier or PCSI$SOURCE, the POLYCENTER
              utility searches the current default directory for the
              UCX kit.

           8. The interactive installation procedure begins, and you
              are prompted for information.

              A sample installation script is shown in Example 2-1.
              Numbered callouts identify those areas that require
              your response. The callouts are explained at the end of
              the script.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              To stop the installation at any time, press Ctrl/Y.
              The installation procedure will delete any files
              that were created, then exit.

              This section takes you through a UCX installation on
              an OpenVMS VAX system using the VMSINSTAL procedure.
              The instructions are appropriate for an initial product
              installation or a version upgrade.

              For complete information about the VMSINSTAL procedure,
              refer to the <REFERENCE>(VMS_SYSMAN1).

        2.2.1 UCX Installation Procedure (OpenVMS VAX)

              Install the UCX software on an OpenVMS VAX system as
              follows. Note that the last step requires you to reboot
              the system to complete the installation.

              1. Complete the recommended preinstallation tasks outlined
                 in Chapter 1.

              2. Log into the SYSTEM account.

              3. If another version of the UCX software exists on your
                 system, shut down that version by issuing the following
                 command:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:UCX$SHUTDOWN

              4. Check to ensure that no one is logged onto the system.

              5. Create a log file to record the installation procedure,
                 if you want a copy for your records.

              6. Set the default directory to SYS$UPDATE.

              7. If you are installing the UCX software from the OpenVMS
                 Consolidated Software Distribution CD-ROM to the
                 OpenVMS VAX system, enter the following command:

                 information about how to obtain online or printed
                 release notes.

              If you are installing the UCX software from either a
              TK50 cartridge or a magnetic tape onto an OpenVMS VAX
              system, enter the following command:

              $ @VMSINSTAL UCX042 ddcu: OPTIONS N

              where:

              o  ddcu: is the device where you mounted the distribu-
                 tion media. The fields are:

                 dd - device name
                 c - controller name
                 u - unit number

              o  OPTIONS N instructs the procedure to display
                 information about how to obtain online or printed
                 release notes.

           8. The interactive installation procedure begins, and you
              are prompted for information.

              A sample installation script is shown in Example 2-2
              and Example 2-3. Numbered callouts identify those areas
              that require your response. The callouts are explained
              at the end of the examples.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              To stop the installation at any time, press Ctrl/Y.
              The installation procedure will delete any files
              that were created, then exit.

                                                         Configuring UCX



              After you install the UCX software successfully, you need
              to specify (configure) the components and characteristics
              you require for your particular system. This will maximize
              interoperability and resource sharing between your system
              and another OpenVMS system, UNIX system, or a system that
              supports the TCP/IP protocol suite and Sun Microsystems'
              Network File System (NFS).

              The UCX product provides an easy-to-use, menu-driven
              configuration procedure for you to configure components
              and functionality.

              This chapter explains the command procedure, provides
              sample scripts, and summarizes additional configuration
              and setup tasks.

     Configuring UCX
     3.4 Starting UCX

     3.4 Starting UCX

           You must start UCX after you configure the standard
           software and optional components, but before you run tests
           or customize the UCX environment.

           Start UCX on your system as follows:

           1. Access the main Configuration menu by entering the
              following command:

              $ @SYS$MANAGER:UCX$CONFIG

           2. Enter option 6 to start UCX.

     3.5 Verifying the Configuration

           You can verify the UCX configuration by running the
           installation verification procedure (IVP).

           You should run the IVP if the following apply:

           o  If you loaded the Product Authorization Key (PAK), and
              you want to verify that the lower-layer software and
              the Portmapper service are installed correctly.

           o  If you did not load the PAK, but you want to verify
              that UCX is installed correctly for DECwindows to
              display UCX applications.

           o  To transfer device socket packets that continuously
              vary in size, between a sender and a receiver.

           o  To test the Portmapper service with a pair of client
              /server programs. The IVP reports the time it took to
              run the test to SYS$OUTPUT.

           Before you run the IVP, make sure the UCX software is
           started and you have SYSPRV, OPER, NETMBX, and TMPMBX
           privileges. (You use the SETPRV command to set the
           privileges.)

           Run the IVP as follows:

           1. Invoke the command procedure:

              $ @SYS$MANAGER:UCX$CONFIG

              2. Enter option 7. If the IVP does not complete success-
                 fully, the procedure displays error messages. All IVP
                 errors are fatal and use the same format as system
                 messages. For example:

                 %UCX-E-IDENT, explanation of error.

                 Table 3-2 lists some common problems that cause IVP
                 error messages. If the recommended action does not
                 correct the problem, contact your DIGITAL support
                 representative.

              is incorrect.           rerun the configuration procedure.

              Startup fails.          Check the SYSGEN parameters in the
                                      MODPARAMS.DAT file and increase
                                      them if necessary.

                                      Shut down and restart UCX.

              The IVP fails because   Register a DIGITAL TCP/IP Services
              the_PAK_is_missing._____for_OpenVMS_PAK.__________________

              3. To run the IVP any time after exiting the configuration
                 procedure, invoke the IVP command procedure as follows:

                 $ @SYS$TEST:UCX$IVP

              4. To activate the new configuration, reboot your system.

        3.6 Additional Configuration Tasks

              After you run the configuration procedure and enable
              the functionality and components appropriate for your
              network, you need to complete additional configuration
              tasks to enable access to UCX applications. UCX provides a
              management command interface and logical names you can use
              to modify or customize the software for your environment.

     Configuring UCX
     3.6 Additional Configuration Tasks

           The additional configuration tasks include:

           o  Populating databases

           o  Setting up user accounts

           o  Setting up communication and NFS proxies

           o  Defining print queues

           o  Setting up, exporting, and maintaining file systems

           o  Tuning the system for optimum performance

           For information about these and other configuration tasks,
           see the Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Management
           guide.

     3.7 Automatically Starting and Stopping UCX

           To start the UCX software automatically when the system
           starts up, edit the SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM file and
           include the following command line after the command line
           that starts the procedure:

           @SYS$MANAGER:UCX$STARTUP

           To stop UCX automatically when the system shuts down, add
           the following command line to the SYS$MANAGER:SYSHUTDOWN.COM
           file:

           @SYS$MANAGER:UCX$SHUTDOWN

     3.8 Automatically Starting UCX Services

           For the UCX services to start after you log into your
           OpenVMS account, the OpenVMS systemwide login procedure
           (typically SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM) must be world-readable
           and world-executable.

           To display the current privileges, issue:

           $ DIRECTORY SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM /PROTECTION

           If the protections are not world read and edit (W:RE),
           issue:

           $ SET PROTECTION=(W:RE) SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM

        3.9 Specifying UCX as the Transport for DECwindows Applications

              To enable the UCX software as the transport interface
              for DECwindows applications, add the following line to
              the SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM command
              procedure:

              $ DECW$SERVER_TRANSPORTS == "DECNET,LOCAL,TCPIP"

              Then restart DECwindows by entering the following command:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:DECW$STARTUP RESTART

              If DECnet or DECnet-Plus runs on the same system, start
              it.

              To display DECwindows applications from a DECwindows
              client (remote host) to a DECwindows server (your
              workstation), proceed as follows:

              1. Set up security on the remote host.

              2. Add the remote client to the local UCX hosts database.

              3. Edit the SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM
                 command procedure by adding the following line:

                 $ DECW$SERVER_TRANSPORTS == "DECNET,LOCAL,TCPIP"

              4. Set the display for the applications to the remote
                 host:

                 $ SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=remote_host/TRANSPORT=TCPIP
