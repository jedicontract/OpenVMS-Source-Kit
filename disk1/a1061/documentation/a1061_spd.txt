         PRODUCT NAME: Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V6.1         SPD:

         61.49.04

         DESCRIPTION

         Compaq[TM] Office Server for OpenVMS[TM] V6.1 enhances previous ver-
         sions of Office Server and ALL-IN-1[TM], delivering robust and scaleable
         messaging and collaboration services to a wide range of mail clients
         on OpenVMS Alpha and VAX, communicating with a choice of messaging
         backbones and directories. Key new features include:

         o  Euro Symbol Support

         o  Improved iPAQ support from the integral IMAP4 Server

         o  One File Definition Language (FDL) file per System Document Attributes
            File (SDAF)

         o  AIDA Server Cache Flush timer can be set to a particular time of
            day

         o  Batch account creation command procedure

         Office Server provides facilities for mixed groups of IMAP4, POP3,
         Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows 95/98, Apple[R] Macintosh[R],
         and VT users in small departments or across the enterprise to com-
         municate, share documents, and work together to raise collective pro-
         ductivity.

         Through electronic mail and document sharing across wide area net-
         works, users can collaborate on multimedia information that has been
         created on desktop, departmental, and corporate systems. In addi-
         tion, due to Office Server's centralized server-based origins and
         comprehensive system management facilities, a minimum management staff
         is required.

                                                                June 2002

         TeamLinks CLIENT SUPPORT

         Services available to TeamLinks Windows V4.5, V5.0 and Macintosh V2.6.2
         clients:

         Office Server provides workgroup services to TeamLinks clients over
         TCP/IP, SLIP, DECnet[TM], asynchronous links or AppleTalk[R] (to Macintosh
         devices). The server enables TeamLinks users to gain access to the
         File Cabinet drawers, nested folders and documents, messaging ser-
         vice, distribution lists, and management functions with minimum re-
         training for VT users familiar with ALL-IN-1.

         Users employing Windows and Macintosh desktops with their choice of
         personal productivity applications available for these platforms can
         transfer documents of any type (including multimedia documents) to
         the Office Server File Cabinet for secure storage, and send these
         documents via the messaging service using existing distribution lists.
         Integral distributed document sharing enables TeamLinks users to ac-
         cess any type of document in remote Office Servers and ALL-IN-1 sys-
         tems as if they were local.

         Office Server V6.1 allows users of heterogeneous clients (Web based,
         IMAP4, POP3, Windows, Macintosh, VT) to coexist and fully partic-
         ipate in workgroup activities.

         For full details of the facilities available from TeamLinks clients
         please refer to SPDs 63.25 (Windows) and 48.17 (Macintosh).

           ___________________________Note ___________________________

           The level of client service can be extended beyond that of-
           fered by the TeamLinks V5.0 Client. A full complement of Application
           Programming Interfaces (APIs) is provided to the File Cabinet
           Server and AIDA Server for application developers.

           ___________________________________________________________

         MAPI CLIENT SUPPORT

         Office Server provides messaging and collaboration services to Messaging
         Application Programming Interface (MAPI) enabled applications such
         as Outlook via the Compaq Office Server MAPI Driver V6.0, V7.0 and

         Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V6.1             SPD: 61.49.04


         V7.1 supplied separately. Mail, directory, file cabinet, group man-
         agement, drag and drop, and document conversion operations are sup-
         ported on 32-bit XP Professional, Windows 2000, Windows NT V4.0 work-
         stations and Windows 98 PCs. For full details of the functionality
         offered refer to SPD: 61.43.05 for V7.1 and 61.43.04 for V7.0.

         WORLD WIDE WEB ACCESS

         Users on the Internet or intranets can reply, forward, create and
         send mail whilst accessing their own personal drawers, folders, mes-
         sages and documents - as well as any others to which they have been
         granted access - with user logon and password authorization via the
         Compaq Office Server Web Interface V7.0 and V7.1 supplied separately.
         Utilizing standard Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator[R] and
         Microsoft Internet Explorer from, for example, an Internet Café, mes-
         sages and documents can be viewed and downloaded to the PC.

         In addition, any document placed in a drawer with World Read access
         or Internet access can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet (sub-
         ject to firewalls and any requisite tunneling software). No special-
         ized Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) authoring tool is required on
         the server to publish documents on the Internet, and updating doc-
         uments is simply a question of filing a new document in the File Cabinet
         for immediate access from the Web. For further details refer to SPD:
         61.55.05 for V7.1 and 61.55.04 for V7.0.


           ________________________ Important ________________________

           All documents within the Office Server File Cabinet can be made
           secure by the inherent security capabilities. However, if these
           facilities are not used correctly, access from Office Server
           to the Internet may open up the possibility of security vi-
           olations. Compaq accepts no responsibility for the security
           of documents within Compaq Office Server.

           ___________________________________________________________

         MESSAGING AND DIRECTORY SERVICES

         Office Server is able to communicate with a variety of message trans-
         fer agents (MTAs) and directory service agents (DSAs).

         Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V6.1             SPD: 61.49.04


         MAILbus 400

         With the inclusion of the X/Open[TM] XAPI and XDS interface stubs,
         customers may choose X.400 Alpha-based (either OpenVMS or Compaq Tru64
         UNIX[TM]) MAILbus 400 and prerequisite Compaq Enterprise Directory
         (was known as Compaq X.500) Service Agents as their mail backbone,
         deploying MTAs and DSAs when and where they wish, with local or re-
         mote connection to Office Servers.


         PMDF

         Another option is PMDF from Process Software, which delivers an AlphaServer[TM]
         based smtp/MIME backbone, having direct access to Office Server's
         MRIF V2.0 interface, without the need for Message Router. PMDF can
         utilize a variety of directory services, including Compaq Enterprise
         Directory V4.0 and above with full LDAPv3 support, its own (Innosoft)
         Distributed Directory Server (IDDS) V4.4.1, as well as the Network
         profile, integral to Office Server. PMDF does not support Message
         Router's Distributed Directory Services (DDS).

         LDAPv3

         Office Server supports Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
         V3, enabling the utilization of increasingly popular LDAPv3 direc-
         tory services. The implementation within Office Server V6.1 enables
         the use of the VT client and integral Office Server management util-
         ities to populate the following LDAP directories:

         o  OpenVMS Enterprise Directory for eBusiness V5.0 and above

         o  Tru64 UNIX Enterprise Directory for eBusiness V5.0 and above

         o  Process Software (Innosoft) Distributed Directory Server (IDDS)
            V4.4.1

         Address lookups are also supported from TeamLinks, Outlook clients,
         Web Browsers, VT and Office Server management utilities.

         Message Router/MAILbus 1

         Customers may continue with Message Router for OpenVMS VAX, as the
         MRIF V2.0 interface is included. The Message Router OpenVMSmail Gateway
         allows Office Server users to exchange messages with users of the
         OpenVMS Personal Mail Utility. Refer to the Message Router for OpenVMS
         VAX Software Product Description (SPD 26.33).

         Message interchange with the Internet and intranets is possible from
         MAILbus 400, PMDF and Message Router. Internet style addressing is
         honoured by Office Server out-of-the-box with MAILbus 400 and PMDF.

         IMAP4 SERVER

         Internet Messaging Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4rev1) is supported as stan-
         dard within Office Server V6.1. Users can access their INBOX or any
         other folder from standard Internet mail clients such as Outlook Express
         and Netscape Communicator with user name and password authorization.
         Upon connection, operations may be performed on documents and mes-
         sages in the File Cabinet such as creation, reading, refiling, at-
         tribute modification, forwarding, replying and deleting. The pro-
         cessed mail is transferred to a predefined smtp "sendmail" server
         such as Compaq TCP/IP Services or Process Software MultiNet[R] for
         distribution. Office Server V6.1 offers ten levels of folder nest-
         ing.

         POP3 SERVER

         Post Office Protocol 3 is supported as standard within Office Server
         V6.1. Users access their INBOX folder from standard Internet mail
         clients such as Eudora and Netscape with user name and password au-
         thorization. Upon connection, the contents of the Inbox are down-
         loaded to the client for offline processing. Upon reconnection, the
         processed mail is transferred to a predefined "sendmail" server such
         as Compaq TCP/IP Services or MultiNet[R] for distribution.

         The Office Server IMAP4 and POP3 Servers offers a number of addi-
         tional features including:

         o  The ability to access any personal Office Server folder or shared
            drawer, and download the contents to the client.

         o  Honours the "delete/retain message on server" option. The sta-
            tus of messages left on the server can be configured.

         o  Conversion to text of WPS-PLUS (V4.2 and above) and WordPerfect[R]
            (V4.2 and above) messages and documents as they are transmitted
            to the client.

         o  Available on both OpenVMS Alpha and VAX.

         DISTRIBUTED FILE CABINET

         Distributed Sharing Option is included in Office Server as standard,
         enabling users on remote systems to access documents in nominated
         drawers and folders as if they were local to them.

         As multimedia documents of all types become larger and distribution
         lists longer, the ability to directly access information reduces the
         load on the messaging system, leading to an overall performance im-
         provement. Typically, groups of users would be notified of the ex-
         istence of a document in a local folder by a small mail message, which
         offers the individuals the choice of whether they wish to access it
         or not.

         Users with appropriate privileges, administrators, and system man-
         agers are able to set up access lists and controls, ensuring that
         only authorized individuals and groups of users can gain access to
         documents and messages within specifically-defined drawers and fold-
         ers.

         This capability is known within ALL-IN-1 as Distributed Sharing Option
         (SPD: 36.97).

         FILE CABINET/FILE CABINET MANAGEMENT

         The Office Server V6.1 File Cabinet offers the ability to nest fold-
         ers up to ten levels deep (not available to VTs) and to create empty
         folders. It is a full multimedia file repository. Documents and mes-
         sages of any type, such as HTML, MP3, Postscript[R], .DOC, .XLS, .PPT,
         MPP, JPEG, MPEG, full motion video, audio, ASCII and other formats
         can all be stored in the File Cabinet.

         Fault Tolerance and Load Balancing

         The File Cabinet offers fault tolerance in that in the event of a
         File Cabinet Server or AIDA Server failure, upon restart, automatic
         reconnection to TeamLinks V4.5, V5.0, Outlook and Web clients will
         be attempted.

         It is also possible to specify the maximum number of client connec-
         tions to each FCS and AIDA Server thereby spreading the load across
         multiple servers, multiple CPUs and multiple nodes within a clus-
         ter. In addition, specific clients may be automatically connected
         every time to lightly loaded servers thereby ensuring very good re-
         sponse times to specific users.

         Established Features

         The File Cabinet adopts the sharing model whereby a message sent to
         multiple recipients on the local system is not copied to every re-
         cipient, but pointers are utilized allowing each recipient to read
         the one copy of the message. This offers two major advantages over
         the one copy for each recipient model - better performance and much
         reduced disk storage requirements.

         The File Cabinet is similar in function to a standard office fil-
         ing cabinet with drawers containing documents contained within fold-
         ers. Each folder may have up to ten levels of nesting (not avail-
         abel to VTs) enabling a more structured method of retaining infor-
         mation. Folders are in alphabetical order and documents within the
         folders are ordered by date and time of creation.

         In a system utilising Nested Folders, VT users will still be able
         to see all folders and access all messages and documents as in ear-
         lier versions but it will not be obvious that the documents are stored
         in recognisable Nested Folders.

         Document information (such as title, date created, document number,
         author, keywords, and type) is maintained in the File Cabinet. Facilities
         are provided for the user to maintain and manage the contents of the
         File Cabinet. The user can print or delete more than one document
         at a time. Selection of the documents can be made with user-specified
         criteria.

         Documents (individual or by folder) can be refiled, cross-filed, or
         duplicated. Information such as title and associated keywords can
         be changed. When a document has multiple cross-filings within a sin-
         gle drawer, only one copy of the document body is stored, thereby
         minimizing storage space.

         Documents deleted by a user are filed in the WASTEBASKET folder un-
         til it is emptied.

         The File Cabinet provides access to documents through a common mech-
         anism, regardless of the format of the documents. Support is pro-
         vided as standard for document formats of virtually any type, in-
         cluding multimedia. In addition, all X.400 P2 attributes can be stored
         in the Office Server File Cabinet.

         Document reservation allows each user to protect a document while
         it is undergoing a series of edits, in situ or remotely, prevent-
         ing other users from modifying it until unreserved. While it is re-
         served, other users can read but not edit the document.

         Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V6.1             SPD: 61.49.04


         The document handling model makes a clear distinction between re-
         visable and final form documents. The model provides clear separa-
         tion of formatting and printing, so that formatting of documents can
         be performed separately from printing.

         Mail Janitor

         A mail janitor utility is incorporated in the base product. It al-
         lows the system manager to refile old messages from the READ and OUTBOX
         folders to the user's WASTEBASKET folder. The manager can set the
         maximum permitted age of messages in the READ and OUTBOX folders (de-
         fault 60 days) and a maximum number of messages to delete per folder.
         Profile and Policies options can set and override default actions
         for number of messages and user length of absence.


         Shared Filing

         Users can create shared drawers to allow other users to read and edit
         shared documents. Access controls are provided so that the drawer
         owner can specify which users or named groups of users are allowed
         to access a drawer and the operations they are allowed to perform
         in it. Concurrence control ensures that certain actions are prohib-
         ited while a user is modifying a shared document. For example, while
         a user is editing a shared document, other users attempting to edit
         that document will be informed the document is in use.

         The Reservation feature enables users on clients such as Outlook,
         TeamLinks, or VT to reserve a document in the File Cabinet before
         uploading the document to the user's workstation, thereby indicat-
         ing to all other users who have access to that document that the doc-
         ument is in the process of being modified. Anyone subsequently at-
         tempting to modify the document is informed that it is reserved by
         another individual and that only Read access is permitted. Only when
         the reserver returns the modified document and removes the reser-
         vation can others access the document with more than Read access.

         Group Services

         Users with suitable profile settings can define a set of users as
         a group. Multiple groups can be defined. Groups can be assigned ac-
         cess privileges to shared documents or drawers. Members can be added
         to or deleted from a group, and associated access rights are auto-
         matically assigned or removed. Users can also check what groups they
         belong to.

         MAIL

         The following information is specific to Office Server VT client ac-
         cess, describing the functionality available. Many of these oper-
         ations are accessible from TeamLinks and MAPI-enabled applications
         also. Please check the relevant SPD for a complete list of each prod-
         uct's capabilities.

         The Electronic Messaging application provides a means of exchang-
         ing messages with other users. The user can create, edit, print, delete,
         read, send, answer, and forward messages. The message header (which
         contains addressee(s), subject, and mail classification) and the text
         of the message can be edited prior to being dispatched.

         When creating a message, the user specifies the addressee(s) to whom
         the message is to be sent. Optionally, any addressee(s) to receive
         copies or blind carbon copies (bcc) of the message may be included.
         In addition, users may specify an expiry date for each message sent,
         along with importance (low, normal, or high) and sensitivity (Not
         Sensitive, Company Confidential, Private, or Personal). To save time
         with addressing, the user can create personal distribution lists or
         nicknames (seen only by the user).

         Incoming messages can be forwarded, answered, or both. Answers can
         be directed to the sender only, or to all the recipients of the mes-
         sage. Senders can request confirmation that addressees have received
         the message, read it, or both. Priority for delivery of the message
         can be assigned as Express, First Class, or Second Class. The user
         can specify that the sending of a message be deferred to a time cho-
         sen by the user.

         Messages appear to the user and are treated as documents. Office Server
         maintains folders for incoming, read, created, and sent messages.
         Once a message is sent, one copy of that message (per system or clus-
         ter) is shared by the sender and receiver(s) and cannot be edited.
         Messages can be refiled and cross-filed in the user's File Cabinet.
         Documents already in the File Cabinet can be sent to other users.

         The user can choose to have all incoming messages automatically for-
         warded to another user. Alternatively, the user can create a reply
         message that is sent in response to all incoming mail (for example,
         "I am out of the office until. . .").

         Shared filing within Electronic Messaging ensures that operations
         behave correctly in shared and distributed environments. Mail op-
         erations always take place in the user's MAIN drawer, whatever the
         previous context.

         An index of attachments to a message can be displayed and a set of
         options is provided for printing or reading individual attachments.
         Attachments can be filed as revisable text or as messages which can
         be forwarded.

         The Set Mail User (SMU) option allows a user to perform many mail
         operations on behalf of another user, such as a secretary for a man-
         ager. The Grant Mail Access (GMA) option lets users specify other
         users who may process their mail. The mail header displays both users'
         names when a mail message is sent by a user employing SMU.

         Addressing includes:

         o  Automatic recognition of Internet addresses

         o  Integral X.400 addressing support

         o  For backwards compatibility and minimum disruption for users, the
            continued support of Message Router style addressing, even when
            the mail backbone has been replaced with MAILbus 400

         o  The ability to create a distribution list using the list of ad-
            dresses from a received message header

         o  Nickname support - long nicknames, manipulation of the long mail
            addresses common on messages sent or received via gateways to other
            mail systems, and the ability to create a nickname from the sender
            of a message

         DIRECTORIES

         The Directories subsystem provides access to, and maintenance of,
         directories available to the user. The user can view a directory of
         telephone numbers and addresses which is maintained by the system
         manager. A directory of all the Office Server users can also be viewed.

         Facilities are provided for the user to maintain and view a personal
         telephone directory, nicknames, and distribution lists.

         With the adoption of MAILbus 400 as the mail backbone, directory ser-
         vices are provided by Enterprise Directory for eBusiness wka Compaq
         X.500. Please refer to SPDs 81.03.01 (OpenVMS) and 81.04.01 (Tru64
         UNIX).

         With the installation of Enterprise Directory for eBusiness or MAILbus
         Distributed Directory Service, Office Server provides the user with
         the ability to perform mail directory searches on defined criteria
         such as name, department, location, and organization.

         See also the section on LDAP support above.

         SYSTEM MANAGEMENT

         The System Management utilities accessible from VTs are used to per-
         form routine maintenance, including:

         o  Scheduling and rescheduling of housekeeping procedures

         o  Management of printers

         o  Direct maintenance of NETWORK.DAT, Enterprise Directory, LDAP and
            DDS profiles

         o  Metering and quota management of the shared area

         A system manager can nominate a user as a system administrator to
         help with the management of:

         o  File Cabinet and AIDA servers in support of PC and Macintosh clients
            and other Office Server components

         o  User accounts (create, delete, move, rename)

         o  Mail system Sender/Fetcher processes and queue maintenance

         o  Document archiving

         o  System distribution lists

         o  Drawers, including the restriction of individual user drawer cre-
            ation

         o  Mail janitor functionality

         o  Suppressing the printing of distribution lists

         o  Scheduling housekeeping tasks

         o  Monitoring Office Server exception and information reports

         o  Initiating Office Server shutdown

         Office Server administrators do not require OpenVMS system privi-
         leges.

         Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V6.1             SPD: 61.49.04


         Office Server supplies a metering facility that enables system man-
         agers to collect data on resource usage within Office Server ses-
         sions for pre-defined events. Application developers can define and
         create their own additional meters. Meters record the number of times
         a meter is called, CPU usage, Direct I/O, Buffered I/O and Page Faults.

         PRINTING

         The Printing facility provides users with the ability to specify where
         a document is to be printed, the number of copies, and the output
         format. The output can be directed to any of the printers available
         to the Office Server user, to another document, or to the user's ter-
         minal. Printing and formatting is handled in the background, free-
         ing the terminal for other actions when interaction with the print
         formatter is not needed.

         Printer level checking ensures the print destination supports the
         document's final form format.

         Print and LPS print options (LPS20, LPS40, PS17, PS32) can be spec-
         ified during a print operation. System-defined and user-defined print
         styles can be utilized for improved ease-of-use.

         Distribution List Print Suppression

         Suppression of the distribution list on reading and/or printing of
         a mail message is determined according to the user's current pre-
         ferred settings.

         JOB SERVICES

         Office Server provides users with the ability to perform operations
         on their jobs on print, batch, and server queues. Using the multi-
         ple select indexing capability, users can get information on jobs,
         delete them, edit their attributes, and restart currently-executing
         jobs.

         Management of queues and jobs can be performed within Office Server.
         Managers can assign one or more users to manage specific local queues
         and to requeue jobs to different queues.

         PROFILE

         Each Office Server user has a user profile that contains informa-
         tion pertaining to the user.

         The VT user can access and modify part of their user profile includ-
         ing full name, address, telephone number, department, and title. In
         addition, user preference information (such as work week and work-
         ing hours, editing style, mail notification, and read receipt han-
         dling) can be modified.

         The Manager maintains information such as user privileges, default
         directory, and form library access.

         INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT

         Office Server is designed to support multilingual operations. When
         upgrading from Office Server V6.0 primary and secondary language PAKs
         must remain installed on the system. Secondary language PAKs must
         remain installed throughout the deployment of Office Server V6.1.

         Multi-lingual support is subject to availability of the specific trans-
         lation. Office Server can be deployed in a multilingual network and
         can support multilingual operations on a single system. However, all
         language kits, including U.S. English, must be the same version.

         DOCUMENT PROCESSING

         The Document Processing application enables VT and terminal emula-
         tion users to create, edit, print, delete, and read documents. The
         editor supplied with Office Server is EVE with EDT[TM] keys.

         DOCUMENT CONVERSION

         Office Server includes the following supported data types:

         o  Rich Text Format (RTF)

         o  WK1, WK3, DIF, MacWrite[R], DX[TM], WPL, PICT, WordPerfect

         o  PS - the final form PostScript document format

         Office Server allows all the data types to be read, with the excep-
         tion of PostScript. The CDA[TM] conversion function is used to con-
         vert to/from the above data types.

                                        13

 



         Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V6.1             SPD: 61.49.04


         Users can send and receive these document types in mail, store them
         in their File Cabinet, read, print, copy, and convert them. The qual-
         ity of formatting of the displayed data depends on the CDA facil-
         ities provided by the underlying OpenVMS system. Office Server uses
         the CDA character cell formatter, which gives improved results with
         correct formatting and the inclusion of externally-referenced files.

         Office Server attempts to print CDA documents in PostScript if the
         destination printer is capable of it; otherwise, Office Server con-
         verts the document to ASCII text before printing.

         If a user attempts to edit any CDA document using a standard edi-
         tor, the normal handling results in a message telling the user that
         the document format is not supported by the editor. However, the user
         can convert a CDA document into a suitable format for editing, and
         then use the appropriate editor. Through conversion, there is a po-
         tential for formatting attributes to be lost.

         For conversions on Alpha, DECwindows[TM] V1.2 must be installed and
         the minimum version of CDA$ACCESS.EXE and DDIF$CC_VIEWSHR.EXE is V1.8.

         For conversions on VAX, CDA Converter Library V2.2 must be installed,
         which will also install CDA Run-Time Services V1.0. The minimum ver-
         sion of CDA$ACCESS.EXE and DDIF$CC_VIEWSHR.EXE is V1.7.

         System wide Features

         o  Menu navigation for VT and terminal emulation users.

         o  Applications are accessed through a hierarchy of menus. Experienced
            users can easily bypass menus.

         o  Users can interrupt their current activity to read a new mail mes-
            sage, display the current time, or access directories.

         Help

         VT users can press the Help key to invoke online help for some func-
         tions of Office Server. The Help facility provides basic informa-
         tion on the function in question without the user having to refer
         to the documentation.

         Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V6.1             SPD: 61.49.04


         LICENSING

         Compaq Office Server V6.1 supports two mutually exclusive styles
         of licensing:

         o  For customers upgrading from Office Server V6.0 that are
            traditionally licensed due to their ALL-IN-1 heritage,
            Clusterwide, Capacity and User (Concurrent and Personal)
            licensing enforced by Product Authorization Keys (PAKs)
            continues to be supported, ensuring that customers experience
            no changes to the way they are currently licensed, thereby
            eliminating any administrative overhead. ALL-IN-1 V3.2,
            which is Year 2000 ready, will remain in the price book, and
            existing traditional licenses will continue to be orderable.

         o  For:

            -  new deployments of Office Server

            Client Access Licensing (CAL) is mandatory.

         Client Access Licensing

         Client Access Licensing (CAL) has the financial advantage of
         granting to one user the rights to access the Office Server
         system and Compaq clients in the one license. For example, one
         CAL would enable a user to access the Office Server capabilities
         from a Compaq TeamLinks, Compaq MAPI Driver, Web Browser or VT
         client without incurring the cost of the client software itself.
         If the client is developed by a third party however, the rights
         to install that client on the desktop must be purchased from the
         third party vendor, as the rights to third party software are
         not granted by the Compaq Office Server CAL.

         Without exception, one CAL must be acquired for every user
         featured in the Office Server profile; that is, at all times
         every registered user must be licensed by one CAL. CALs may be
         moved between systems as user populations fluctuate, but the
         number of CALs present on the site must equal or exceed the
         number of registered users at the site.

           ___________________________Note ___________________________

           In OpenVMS clusters, traditional licensing and Client
           Access Licensing cannot coexist. For example, one Office

         Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V6.1             SPD: 61.49.04


           Server system licensed by CALs must not be added to
           an Office Server cluster licensed by Capacity or User
           licenses.

           ___________________________________________________________

         Office Server System License

         In addition to CALs, each Office Server installation must be
         licensed by one Office Server (system) License (UPI is 5TB).
         For Office Server deployments on OpenVMS clusters, one system
         license (QM-5TB9A-*A) is required per OpenVMS system in the
         cluster.

         Each Office Server kit (QB-5TBAA-SA) includes the license,
         media, and documentation for Office Server, and the media,
         documentation, and license to install one Office Server
         Administrator client (UPI is 5TC). Additional Administrator
         Clients may be installed upon the acquisition of additional
         licenses (QM-5TC9A-AA).

         Customers with Compaq Service agreements

         Office Server V6.1 is distributed on the OpenVMS Alpha and VAX
         Software Product Libraries, formerly CONDIST.


         Non-Service Paying Customers

         Customers without a Compaq support agreement should consult
         their Compaq or Compaq Partner account manager regarding
         upgrading to Office Server V6.1.
