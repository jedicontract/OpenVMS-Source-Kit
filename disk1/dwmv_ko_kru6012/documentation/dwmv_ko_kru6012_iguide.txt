        Conventions

              Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS Alpha contains
              a graphical user interface that is derived from the Common
              Desktop Environment (CDE). This interface is referred to
              throughout this document as the New Desktop.

              VMScluster systems are now referred to as OpenVMS Cluster
              systems. Unless otherwise specified, references to OpenVMS
              Clusters or clusters in this document are synonymous with
              VMSclusters.

              In this manual, every use of DECwindows and DECwindows
              Motif refers to Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS
              software.

              The following conventions are also used in this manual:

              Ctrl/x           A sequence such as Ctrl/x indicates that
                               you must hold down the key labeled Ctrl
                               while you press another key or a pointing
                               device button.

              <Return>         In examples, a key name enclosed in a
                               box indicates that you press a key on
                               the keyboard. (In text, a key name is not
                               enclosed in a box.)

                               In the HTML version of this document, this
                               convention appears as brackets, rather
                               than a box.

               . . .           Horizontal ellipsis points in
                               examples indicate one of the following
                               possibilities:

                               o  Additional optional arguments in a
                                  statement have been omitted.

                               o  The preceding item or items can be
                                  repeated one or more times.

                               o  Additional parameters, values, or other
                                  information can be entered.

                                                                       xi

 








          .                Vertical ellipsis points indicate the
          .                omission of items from a code example
          .                or command format; the items are omitted
                           because they are not important to the
                           topic being discussed.

          ( )              In command format descriptions,
                           parentheses indicate that you must enclose
                           the choices in parentheses if you choose
                           more than one.

          [ ]              In command format descriptions, brackets
                           indicate optional elements. You can
                           choose one, none, or all of the options.
                           (Brackets are not optional, however, in
                           the syntax of a directory name in an
                           OpenVMS file specification or in the
                           syntax of a substring specification in
                           an assignment statement.)

          |                In command format descriptions, vertical
                           bars separating items inside brackets
                           indicate that you choose one, none, or
                           more than one of the options.

          { }              In command format descriptions, braces
                           surround a required choice of options; you
                           must choose one of the options listed.

          text style       This text style represents the
                           introduction of a new term or the name
                           of an argument, an attribute, or a reason.

                           In the HTML version of this document, this
                           convention appears as italic text.

          italic text      Italic text indicates important
                           information, complete titles of
                           manuals, or variables. Variables include
                           information that varies in system messages
                           (Internal error number), in command
                           lines (/PRODUCER=name), and in command
                           parameters in text (where dd represents
                           the predefined code for the device type).

    Preparing to Install the Software



          o  Section 1.6, Installation Procedure Requirements

    1.1 License Registration

          Before you install and run Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul
          for OpenVMS software on a newly licensed node or cluster,
          you must first register a License Product Authorization
          Key (License PAK) using the License Management Facility
          (LMF). The License PAK is provided along with the kit if
          you ordered the license and media together; otherwise, it
          is provided separately to a location based on your license
          order.

          If you are installing Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for
          OpenVMS software as an update on a node or cluster already
          licensed for this software, you have already completed the
          License PAK registration requirements.

          You must register and load your license for Compaq
          DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS before you run the
          Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and use the
          software.

          To register a license, log in to the system manager account
          (SYSTEM). Then choose one of the following options to
          register the license:

          o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When the
             procedure prompts you for information, respond with data
             from your License PAK.

          o  At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command
             with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to
             License PAK information.

          If you plan to use Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for
          OpenVMS software on more than one node in a VMScluster,
          load the license on the other nodes after you complete this
          installation.

          For complete information about using LMF, see the OpenVMS
          License Management Utility Manual.

            1.5 Required ECO for POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility


        1.5 Required ECO for POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility

              If you are installing the Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul
              for OpenVMS software on an OpenVMS Version 6.2 or 7.1
              system, you must first install an ECO to the POLYCENTER
              Software Installation (PCSI) utility. See the Guide to
              the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS CD-ROM for details
              about this ECO. OpenVMS Versions 7.2 and higher include
              this functionality in the operating system; therefore, you
              need not apply this ECO if you are running OpenVMS Version
              7.2 or higher.

              The following example shows a PCSI ECO installation on an
              OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1 system (installations on other
              OpenVMS versions differ slightly):

        $ PRODUCT INSTALL VMS62TO71U2_PCSI

        The following product has been selected:
            DEC AXPVMS VMS62TO71U2_PCSI V1.0       Patch (maintenance update)

        Do you want to continue? [YES]

        Configuration phase starting ...

        You will be asked to choose options, if any, for each selected product and for
        any products that may be installed to satisfy software dependency requirements.

        DEC AXPVMS VMS62TO71U2_PCSI V1.0

        * This product does not have any configuration options.

        Execution phase starting ...

        The following product will be installed to destination:

    1.5 Required ECO for POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility


    1.5.1 Upgrade Problem After Installing Required PCSI ECO

          After installing the required POLYCENTER Software
          Installation utility ECO, your system will use the new
          features provided by this version of the PCSI utility.
          If a layered product is installed that makes use of this
          new functionality, then it may not be possible to revert
          back to an older version of the utility. The restriction
          occurs because there may be records in the software product
          database that the older version of the utility will not be
          able to interpret.

          This scenario occurs if you install the PCSI ECO, then
          install DECwindows Motif, and later install certain
          upgrades to the OpenVMS operating system. The steps below
          describe the situations when this will occur:

          1. Install the PCSI ECO kit onto OpenVMS Version 6.2, 6.2-
             1H1, 6.2-1H2, 6.2-1H3, 7.1, 7.1-1H1, or 7.1-1H2.

          2. Install DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-6.

          3. Upgrade to (or reinstall) OpenVMS Version 6.2, 6.2-1H1,
             6.2-1H2, 6.2-1H3, 7.1, 7.1-1H1, or 7.1-1H2.

          Upgrading to any of the OpenVMS versions listed in item
          3 may fail (or other PRODUCT command operations on the
          product database may fail) with one of the following
          errors:

          %SYSTEM-F-ACCVIO, access violation, ...
          %PCSI-E-UNSDOCENC, unsupported product document encoding version

          To prevent these failures after installing the PCSI ECO and
          DECwindows Motif, perform the following steps:

          1. Remove DECwindows Motif using the following command:

             $ PRODUCT REMOVE DWMOTIF

          2. Upgrade to (or reinstall) OpenVMS Version 6.2, 6.2-1H1,
             6.2-1H2, 6.2-1H3, 7.1, 7.1-1H1, or 7.1-1H2.

          3. Reinstall the PCSI ECO.

          4. Reinstall DECwindows Motif.

            1.5 Required ECO for POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility


              This workaround is not needed if you upgrading to OpenVMS
              Alpha Version 7.2-1 or higher, or if you are upgrading to
              OpenVMS VAX Version 7.2 or higher. These versions (and all
              later versions) already include the new functionality added
              by the PCSI ECO.

        1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements

              This section discusses the requirements for installing the
              Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS software using
              PCSI and the VMSINSTAL installation procedure.

              The installation procedure checks the following:

              o  Whether you are logged in to an appropriately privileged
                 account (VMSINSTAL installations only)

              o  Whether any other users are logged in to the system

              o  Whether you have the minimum required system account
                 quotas and limits

              o  Whether you have the minimum required disk space

              o  Whether you have the minimum required system parameter
                 values

              See Section 3.1 for information on requirements specific to
              VMSINSTAL installations.

        1.6.1 Process Account Quotas

              The installation procedure requires that the installation
              account has the minimum quotas shown in Table 1-1.

              Table_1-1_Process_Quotas_for_the_Installation_Account______

              Quota_Name__Alpha_Value___VAX_Value________________________

          __________________Account__________________________________

          Quota_Name__Alpha_Value___VAX_Value________________________

          FILLM__________100____________20___________________________

          Use the OpenVMS AUTHORIZE utility to verify and to change
          process quotas for the installation account in the user
          authorization file (UAF). (Some sites may restrict the use
          of the AUTHORIZE utility to certain accounts or users.)
          For example, to change the BYTLM quota for the account-name
          installation account, enter the following commands:

          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
          $ RUN AUTHORIZE
          UAF> SHOW account-name
          UAF> MODIFY account-name /BYTLM = 32768
          UAF> SHOW account-name
          UAF> EXIT
          $ LOGOUT

          After you change the quotas for the installation account,
          log out of the installation account and log in again for
          the new quotas to take effect. You can then proceed with
          the installation.

          User account quotas are stored in the file
          SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT. For more information about modifying
          account quotas, see the description of the AUTHORIZE
          utility in the OpenVMS System Management Utilities
          Reference Manual.

    1.6.2 Disk Space

          Use Table 1-2 to determine the amount of free disk space
          that is required on the system disk to install DECwindows
          Motif components. However, because you can choose not
          to install all the components, your actual disk space
          requirement may be less.

          To determine the number of free blocks on the system disk,
          enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

          $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

    1-8

                                  1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements


              The installation procedure checks for free disk space on
              the system disk. If sufficient space is not available, the
              installation procedure provides the following options:

              o  Install fewer optional files.

              o  For VMSINSTAL installations, restart the installation
                 and specify another disk to use as an alternate working
                 device. See Section 3.1.2 for information about using an
                 alternate working device.

              o  Terminate the installation, create more free disk space
                 on the system disk, and restart the installation.

              o  Continue the installation and risk running out of disk
                 space.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you run out of free disk space during the
                installation, the installation procedure fails.

              Section 3.1.3 for information on using the Distributed
              File Service.

        1.6.3 System Parameters

              Table 1-3 lists the minimum required system parameter
              values for the installation. Depending on the kinds of

        1.6.4 Additional System Maintenance Procedures

              This section explains how to use the System Generation
              utility (SYSGEN) and the AUTOGEN utility to prepare your
              system for the Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS
              installation. The AUTOGEN utility uses system configuration
              data to automatically set system parameters.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The DECwindows Motif installation and startup
                procedures automatically check for required system
                parameter values and pass the appropriate values to
                AUTOGEN. Therefore, in most cases you do not have to
                check and modify these values manually.

                ______________________________________________________

                                                                     1-11

 



    Preparing to Install the Software
    1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements


    1.6.4.1 Checking System Parameter Values

          To check the values of your system parameters, invoke the
          SYSGEN utility by entering the following command at the DCL
          prompt:

          $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
          SYSGEN>

          At the SYSGEN prompt, enter the SHOW command to display the
          value of a system parameter. The following command displays
          the value for the MAXBUF system parameter:

          SYSGEN> SHOW MAXBUF

          After checking the parameters with the SHOW command, enter
          the EXIT command at the SYSGEN prompt to return to DCL
          level.

          If the current values are less than the values in
          Table 1-3, increase the system parameter settings.
          Section 1.6.4.4 describes the procedures for using the
          AUTOGEN utility to increase these values.

    1.6.4.2 Calculating the Number of Free Global Pages and Global
            Sections

          If your system parameter values are equal to or greater
          than the minimum values specified in Table 1-3, you
          can continue with the product installation. However, to
          install and run Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS
          software, you must have sufficient free global pages and
          global sections for the DECwindows Motif software and the
          file SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE.

          First, determine how many free global pages and global
          sections exist on your system and how many are required
          to reinstall a new version of SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE.
          Then, if necessary, use the AUTOGEN utility to increase the
          values of the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS system parameters.

          Enter the following DCL command to determine the number of
          global pages required for SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE:

          $ DIR/SIZE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE

          This command returns the size (in blocks) of the file
          SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE. As an approximation, use this
          figure as the number of global pages needed for the file.

                                  1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements


              Enter the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical function
              to find the number of contiguous free global pages and the
              number of free global sections. The following example shows
              how to obtain this information at your terminal, which is
              the default for SYS$OUTPUT:

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("CONTIG_GBLPAGES") <Return>
              15848
              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS") <Return>
              24

              See Table 1-4 to determine whether the number of contiguous
              free global pages and the number of free global sections is
              sufficient. If these values are not sufficient to continue
              with the installation, then see Section 1.6.4.4, which
              describes the procedures for increasing these values using
              the AUTOGEN utility.

        1.6.4.3 Setting the Size of the Page File

              In order for DECwindows Motif to run with acceptable
              performance, the page file must be large enough to handle
              the virtual memory requirements of your system. The optimal
              size of the page file depends on many factors, such as the
              amount of physical memory on the system and the application
              work load.

              As a general rule, the page file size should be at least
              75,000 blocks on OpenVMS Alpha systems and 50,000 blocks on
              OpenVMS VAX systems. However, these sizes may be too small
              on systems where a large number of applications are run. On
              a heavily loaded system it may be possible to achieve large
              performance improvements by increasing the size of the page
              file by a factor of two or more.


                                                                     1-13

 



    Preparing to Install the Software
    1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements


          Normally you should run AUTOGEN with feedback and let
          AUTOGEN calculate the size of the page file based on the
          usage pattern on your system. To run AUTOGEN with feedback,
          enter the following DCL command:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN SAVPARAMS REBOOT FEEDBACK

          You can also increase the size of the page file by running
          the SYSGEN utility or by invoking the command procedure
          SYS$UPDATE:SWAPFILES.COM.

          For more information about setting the size of the page
          file and running AUTOGEN, see the Guide to Setting Up an
          OpenVMS System. For more information about performance
          tuning in general, see the Guide to OpenVMS Performance
          Management.

    1.6.4.4 Changing System Parameter Values Using the AUTOGEN
            Utility

          Use the AUTOGEN utility to change system parameters.
          AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for parameters that
          are associated with the values you reset manually. To
          change system parameters with AUTOGEN, edit the file
          SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT.

          To change a parameter value listed in this file, delete the
          current value associated with that parameter and enter the
          new value.

          To add a new parameter, add a line to the file and include
          both the name of the parameter and its value. For example:

          MIN_MAXBUF = 8192

          To make incremental adjustments to parameters, such as
          global pages and global sections, use ADD_. The following
          example increases the global pages value by 30,000:

          ADD_GBLPAGES = 30000

          Table 1-5 lists the system parameters that you need to
          adjust incrementally.

              PAGEDYN__________180,000_______100,000_____________________

              After you enter all your changes, exit from the file and
              execute the AUTOGEN utility to recalculate your system
              parameters. Enter the following command to recalculate your
              system parameters and reboot the system:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

              When you specify REBOOT, the AUTOGEN utility performs an
              automatic system shutdown and then reboots the system. Any
              users logged in to the system are immediately disconnected
              during the shutdown. The automatic reboot puts the new
              parameter values into effect.

              For details about using AUTOGEN, see the section about the
              AUTOGEN utility in the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual and
              the AUTOGEN section in OpenVMS System Management Utilities
              Reference Manual.

        1.6.5 Backing Up Your System Disk

              Compaq recommends that you back up your system disk
              before you install any software. At the beginning of the
              installation, the installation procedure asks whether
              your system disk is backed up. Use the backup procedures
              that are established at your site. For details about
              performing a system disk backup, see the section on the
              Backup utility in the OpenVMS System Management Utilities
              Reference Manual.

                                                                     1-15

    1.6.6 Notifying Other Users

          Inform users on the system that you plan to install a
          product and that they must log out during the installation.
          To make sure that you are the only user logged in to the
          system, follow these steps:

          1. Notify current users to log out. Enter the following
             command at the DCL prompt:

             $ REPLY/ALL/BELL/SHUTDOWN -
             _$ "Log out for DECwindows Hangul installation, please..."

          2. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt to prevent
             nonprivileged users from logging in to the system:

             $ SET LOGINS/INTERACTIVE=0

          If possible, give users an estimated time when they can log
          in to the system again.

              $ DEFINE PCSI$SOURCE DKA400:[PCSI_ALPHA_DWMOTIF126]
              $ PRODUCT EXTRACT RELEASE_NOTES DWMOTIF-UI-HANGUL

              Once you extract the release notes to a file, you can print
              the file. Note that you do not need to install the product
              before you extract the release notes.

        2.3 Installing the Software

                ______________________ Important ______________________

                If you are installing Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul
                for OpenVMS software on an OpenVMS Version 7.1 or
                Version 6.2 system, you must install an ECO for
                the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility before
                installing the DECwindows Motif software. See the
                Guide to the Compaq DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS CD-
                ROM for details about this ECO. See Section 1.5 for
                more information.

                ______________________________________________________

              The sections that follow take you through the stages
              of installing your Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for
              OpenVMS software using the POLYCENTER Software Installation
              utility.

              Refer to Chapter 1 for information about account quotas,
              disk space, and system parameters.

              Refer to the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual for complete
              information about responding to questions that the
              POLYCENTER Software Installation utility asks during
              product installation. For example, when you respond to
              questions, you can do the following:

              o  Enter a value and press the Return key to select
                 options.

              o  Press the Return key to accept default values.

              o  Confirm your responses.

                 After you respond to questions by selecting options
                 or accepting default values, the installation utility
                 displays a summary of your answers.

                                                                      2-3

                              Using the VMSINSTAL Procedure (OpenVMS VAX)


              This chapter explains how to install Compaq DECwindows
              Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS software using the VMSINSTAL
              procedure on VAX systems. Included is a step-by-step
              description of the installation procedure, information
              about error recovery, and instructions for accessing the
              release notes.

              Using the VMSINSTAL procedure, the Compaq DECwindows Motif
              /Hangul for OpenVMS installation takes approximately 15
              minutes, depending on the processor type. The VMSINSTAL
              procedure installs the Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for
              OpenVMS product on your system disk.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                A Product Authorization Key (PAK) for Compaq
                DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS must be
                registered and loaded before starting the Compaq
                DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS installation.

    Using the VMSINSTAL Procedure (OpenVMS VAX)



             _______________________ Caution _______________________

             If you do not have a satisfactory backup copy of
             your system disk, do not attempt to install Compaq
             DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS software. Back up
             the system disk (as described in the OpenVMS upgrade
             and installation supplement for your VAX processor)
             before you install Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for
             OpenVMS software.

             Before beginning the installation procedure,
             review Chapter 1 for information about installation
             preparations and requirements.

             ______________________________________________________

          This chapter presents information about the following
          topics:

          o  Section 3.1, Installation Procedure Requirements

          o  Section 3.2, Installation Procedure

          o  Section 3.3, Recovering from Errors

          o  Section 3.4, Accessing the Release Notes

    3.1 Installation Procedure Requirements

          This section discusses the requirements for installing your
          Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS VAX software
          using the VMSINSTAL installation procedure.

                                  3.1 Installation Procedure Requirements


        3.1.1 Process Privileges

              To install Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS
              software, you must be logged in to an account that has the
              SETPRV privilege or the following privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

              The installation procedures turn off the BYPASS privilege
              at the start of the installation and turn it back on when
              the installation is completed.

        3.1.2 Using an Alternate Working Device

              You can use the alternate working device (AWD) option
              to specify another disk to temporarily store the files
              while they are being unpacked from the save sets on the
              distribution media. Once the save sets are unpacked, the
              installation procedure adds or replaces the files that are
              necessary for the installation of Compaq DECwindows Motif
              /Hangul for OpenVMS software from the AWD to the system
              disk.

              If this installation is to upgrade an existing DECwindows
              Motif environment, then the AWD option allows you to
              perform an installation with fewer free blocks on the
              system disk than are otherwise required.

              The installation procedure creates a temporary working
              directory either on the AWD device or by default in the
              following location:

              SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSUPD.facunvvv]

              If you use the AWD option, you can specify a directory.
              Specifying a directory is optional, but the following
              guidelines apply:

              o  If you specify an existing directory, the installation
                 procedure creates a working directory as a subdirectory
                 within the directory that you specify (for example,
                 [WORK.facunvvv]). The installation procedure deletes
                 the working subdirectory after the installation is
                 completed.

                                                                      3-3

 



    Using the VMSINSTAL Procedure (OpenVMS VAX)
    3.1 Installation Procedure Requirements


          o  If you do not specify a directory, the installation
             procedure creates a working directory on the
             specified device with a directory specification of
             [000000.facunvvv]. The installation procedure deletes
             the working directory after the installation is
             completed.

          o  If you specify a nonexistent directory, the installation
             procedure creates both the specified directory and a
             working directory as subdirectories within the directory
             that you specify. The installation procedure deletes
             only the working directory and not the originally
             specified directory after the installation is completed.
             You must delete the specified directory manually.

          Use the following format to invoke the VMSINSTAL procedure
          and specify the AWD option:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL facunvvv dkcu OPTIONS N,AWD=ddcu:[dir]

          Use the following definitions for the variables in the
          command line:

          o  For facunvvv, supply the product name and version
             number.

             For the Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS
             installation, the value of facunvvv is DWMV_KO_KRU6012.

          o  For dkcu, give the device name of the source drive that
             holds the distribution media.

          o  For ddcu, give the device name of the alternate working
             device.

          o  For dir, specify the name of the directory on the
             alternate working device where the product subdirectory
             will be created. The default is [000000].

          For example, to install the Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul
          for OpenVMS product from the compact disc onto an OpenVMS
          VAX system using DKA2 as the alternate working device,
          enter the following command:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DWMV_KO_KRU6012 source-drive -

          _$ OPTIONS N,AWD=DKA2:

                                  3.1 Installation Procedure Requirements


        3.1.3 Using the Distributed File Service

              You can specify a temporary working directory on a disk
              that uses the Distributed File Service (DFS).

              If you use a DFS-mounted disk as your alternate working
              device, the installation procedure erroneously reports that
              there are -1 free blocks on the alternate working device.
              This error occurs because the DFS client (the installation
              procedure, in this case) cannot determine the amount of
              free disk space on the DFS-mounted disk.

              Before using a DFS-mounted disk, manually determine its
              free disk space. Log in to the system on which the disk is
              mounted, and enter the SHOW DEVICE command as follows:

              $ SHOW DEVICE

        3.2 Installation Procedure

              The Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS
              installation procedure consists of a series of questions
              and informational messages. Enter a question mark (?) for
              help at any time during the installation. See Appendix B
              for a sample VMSINSTAL installation of DECwindows Motif on
              an OpenVMS VAX system.

              To stop the installation procedure, press Ctrl/Y. When
              you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure deletes all
              files created up to that point and then exits. You can then
              restart the installation.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                This option is not recommended.

                ______________________________________________________

        3.2.1 Product and Device Names

              During the installation, you must tell the system what
              product is being installed and which drive contains the
              distribution media. Refer to a product with its facility
              name and version; refer to a drive with its device name.
              Use the following format to enter product and device names:

              o  facunvvv

                                                                      3-5

                                               3.2 Installation Procedure


              3. Place the distribution media in the source drive.
                 If your Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for OpenVMS
                 distribution kit contains more than one volume, place
                 the first volume in the drive. During the installation
                 procedure, you will be prompted to load the next volume.
                 The paper labels on the media indicate the order in
                 which you load them.

              4. Start the VMSINSTAL procedure. On the command line,
                 specify the product name (that is, the facility name):
                 DWMV_KO_KRU6012 for OpenVMS VAX systems.

                 Specify OPTIONS N to access the release notes, which are
                 included in your media kit. The Compaq DECwindows Motif
                 for OpenVMS Release Notes can be displayed or printed
                 before the installation begins. Enter the following
                 command at the DCL prompt:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DWMV_KO_KRU6012 ddcu: OPTIONS N

                 For ddcu, specify the device name of the source drive
                 that holds the distribution media. See Section 3.2.1 for
                 more information about the format of product and device
                 names. Also, see the OpenVMS upgrade and installation
                 supplement for your VAX processor.

                 For example, if you install Compaq DECwindows Motif
                 /Hangul for OpenVMS from a magnetic tape cartridge in
                 drive MUA0:, enter the following command to invoke the
                 VMSINSTAL command procedure:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DWMV_KO_KRU6012 MUA0: OPTIONS N

                 If you install Compaq DECwindows Motif /Hangul for
                 OpenVMS using the alternate working device (AWD) option
                 described in Section 3.1.2, invoke the VMSINSTAL command
                 procedure as follows:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DWMV_KO_KRU6012 ddcu: OPTIONS N,AWD=ddcu:[dir]

                 The first instance of ddcu is the device name of the
                 source drive that holds the distribution media. The
                 second instance of ddcu is the device name of the AWD,
                 which is the target device. The variable dir is the
                 name of the directory on the alternate working device in
                 which the product subdirectory is created. The default
                 directory is [000000].

                                                                      3-7
