PRODUCT NAME:  Compaq Fortran 77 for OpenVMS VAX Systems     SPD 25.16.51

DESCRIPTION

Compaq Fortran 77 is an implementation of full language FORTRAN-77,
conforming to American National Standard FORTRAN, ANSI X3.9-1978. It
includes optional support for programs conforming to the previous 
standard, ANSI X3.9-1966. Compaq Fortran 77 meets the Federal Information
Processing Standard Publication (FIPS-69-1) requirements by conforming to 
the ANSI Standard and by including a flagger. The flagger optionally 
produces diagnostic messages for compile-time elements that do not conform 
to the Full-Level ANSI FORTRAN X3.9-1978 Standard. Compaq Fortran 77 also 
conforms to the International Standard ISO 1539-1980(E) and to MIL-STD 1753.

Compaq Fortran 77 includes the following language enhancements to the
ANSI/ISO standard:

o  INCLUDE statement

o  Use of the exclamation point (!) for end of line comments

o  31-character identifiers that can include dollar sign ($) and 
   underscore (_)

o  Suport for up to 255 actual arguments in a CALL statement

o  Support for up to 508 named COMMON blocks per subprogram

o  I/O unit numbers can be any integer value in the range of 0 and 119

The Compaq Fortran 77 compiler provides a multi-phase optimizer that
is capable of performing optimizations across entire program units.

Specific optimizations performed include:

o  Constant folding

o  Optimizations of arithmetic IF, logical IF, and block IF-THEN-ELSE

o  Global common subexpression elimination

o  In-line expansion of statement functions

o  Removal of invariant expressions from loops

o  Optimization of array addressing in loops

o  Value propagation

o  Deletion of redundant and unreachable code

o  Optimized interface to intrinsic functions

o  Improved generated code for references to dummy arguments and 
   variables in COMMON

o  Improved generated code for operations involving COMPLEX variables

                                 4


 

o  Specially optimized scalar code for routines that process large 
   arrays which can significantly reduce page faults and improve 
   application performance (selectable with /OPTIMIZE=LEVEL=4)

Compaq Fortran 77 for OpenVMS VAX Systems has additional features that
support developing applications that take advantage of the VAX vector  
processors or multiprocessor VAX systems.

o  Support for automatic generation of VAX vector-processor instructions

o  Support for automatic and manual decomposition of programs to improve
   performance on multiple-processor OpenVMS VAX systems

o  Multi-level vectorization and decomposition

o  Vectorization of DO loops with both INTEGER*4 and INTEGER*2 loop
   control variables

o  Vectorization of many intrinsic mathematic functions for operands

o  Optimized vector code generation for solving dense systems of linear 
   equations

o  Thorough dependence analysis

o  Compile-time performance analysis to choose the best vectorization
   and/or decomposition method

o  Integration of vector and scalar optimizations of INTEGER*4, REAL*4,
   REAL*8, COMPLEX*8, and COMPLEX*16 types

o  An ASSERT statement to provide additional information to the com-
   piler about the program. The ASSERT statement can be used in some
   programs to achieve a high degree of vectorization and/or automatic
   decomposition. The ASSERT statement can optionally generate code
   to verify the assertions at run time, if desired. ASSERT statements
   can be specified in directive form for portability and will be ig-
   nored by other compilers since they will appear as comments.

                                 5


 

o  The INIT_DEP_FWD directive allows vector processing for many loops
   that would otherwise not qualify due to unknown data dependencies.
   As this directive may change the meaning of the program, Compaq 
   Computer Corporation does not warrant execution results conforming to
   the Fortran standard when this directive is used.

o  The NOVECTOR directive to allow the programmer to control the presence
   and level of vectorization in each nest of DO-loops

o  The /MATH_LIBRARY qualifier to support performance optimized vector 
   math functions

o  The /CHECK=ALIGNMENT qualifier to suppress vector alignment exceptions 
   at run time

o  Generation of diagnostics for vectorization inhibitors

   -  Though some vector inhibition diagnostics will display in the
      listing and on the terminal, the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor
      component of the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/DEC Source Code
      Analyzer is required to display all the vector inhibition di-
      agnostics generated by the compiler.

Compaq Fortran 77 supports the following native VAX floating point data
types:

-  32-bit F_floating data type, with an 8-bit exponent and 23-bit man-
   tissa, which provides a range of approximately 0.29E-38 to 1.70E38
   and a precision of typically 7 decimal digits

-  64-bit D_floating data type, with an 8-bit exponent and 56-bit man-
   tissa, which provides a range of approximately 0.29E-38 to 1.70E38
   and a precision of typically 16 decimal digits

-  64-bit G_floating data type, with an 11-bit exponent and 53-bit man-
   tissa, which provides a range of approximately 0.56E-308 to 0.90E308
   and a precision of typically 15 decimal digits

-  128-bit H_floating data type, with a 15-bit exponent and a 113-bit
   mantissa, which provides a range of approximately 0.84E-4932 to 0.59E4932
   and a precision of typically 33 decimal digits

                                 6


 

The shareable, re-entrant compiler operates under the OpenVMS oper-
ating system. It globally optimizes source programs while taking ad-
vantage of the native instruction set and the OpenVMS virtual memory
system.

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

Parallel Processing Hardware Requirements:

Multiprocessor VAX systems are required for parallel execution of de-
composed DO-loops. However, applications that are compiled using the
Compaq Fortran 77 parallel processing options will run correctly on
single-processor systems.

Vector Processing Hardware Requirements:

                                 8


 

Vector-processor equipped VAX systems are required for proper execu-
tion of vectorized DO-loops. However, applications that are compiled
using the vector-processing options will run on all VAX processors,
using the VAX Vector Instruction Emulation Facility (VVIEF) that is
supplied with OpenVMS. Execution using the VVIEF may be significantly
slower than recompiling for scalar execution.

OPTIONAL HARDWARE

Compaq Fortran 77 for OpenVMS supports the optional vector processing 
hardware on the VAX 9000 and the VAX 6000 Model 400 and VAX 6000
Model 500 processors.

Floating point intensive applications should be run on configurations
with the appropriate hardware support for the floating point data types
being used. Consult the base operating system Software Product Description 
(SPD) for the Floating Point Accelerator or other floating point hardware 
appropriate for your configuration.
