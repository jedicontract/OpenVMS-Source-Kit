        Conventions

              The term PATHWORKS Advanced Server is used in this guide
              to refer to the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
              file and print server. Mentions of Compaq OpenVMS file
              and print servers refers to the PATHWORKS family of file
              and print servers, including PATHWORKS (LAN Manager),
              PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare), PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
              (Advanced Server), and the Advanced Server for OpenVMS.

              The following conventions are used in the PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server documentation:

        1.1 About the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS Software Kit

              The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) kit contains
              the software required to run the following software
              installation options:

              o  The complete PATHWORKS Advanced Server file and print
                 server software, including the License Server, external
                 authentication software, and Upgrade utility.

        1.1 About the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS Software Kit

              o  The standalone external authentication software

              o  The Upgrade utility

              The Upgrade utility helps you migrate from PATHWORKS (LAN
              Manager) to PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server).

        1.1.1 About the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) Server

              The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) server is no longer
              supported. PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) cannot
              be installed on a system where the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
              (NetWare) server is installed. If the installation
              procedure finds the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare)
              server, it optionally invokes the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
              (NetWare) removal procedure (PWVN$DEINSTAL), to remove the
              NetWare server software before installing the PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server software. For more information about the
              NetWare server removal procedure, refer to Section 7.2,
              Removing the PATHWORKS NetWare Server.

              If your clients continue to depend on NetWare software
              to connect to the system, or if you need the IPX/SPX
              transport for any reason, you should designate a system to
              run the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) server.

        1.2 If You Are Upgrading from PATHWORKS (LAN Manager)

              If you have PATHWORKS (LAN Manager) installed, you must
              install the new PATHWORKS Advanced Server. You can choose
              to install just the Upgrade utility initially, and install
              the PATHWORKS Advanced Server later. Refer to the Compaq
              PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) Server Migration
              Guide for more information.

        1.3 Installing DECprint Software

              DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS (DCPS) is a printing
              system that provides queue management and printing
              features for PostScript printers. To share a PostScript
              printer, selected PostScript printers might require use of
              the DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS (DCPS) software for
              communication with the printers over DECnet or TCP/IP.

                                        1.3 Installing DECprint Software

              If you plan to use DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS on
              your system, Compaq recommends that you install it before
              installing the Advanced Server. You must reboot the system
              after installing the DECprint software. You can perform
              the reboot as part of the DECprint Supervisor installation
              procedure, or after you install the Advanced Server but
              before you configure it.

        1.4 About Licensing

              The following sections describe the way the PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server software is licensed, and how to ensure
              clients accessing the server are properly licensed.

        1.4.1 License Requirements

              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server requires that clients
              accessing file and print services be appropriately
              licensed. To conform to this requirement, one of the
              following must be true:

              o  The client must present a client-based license before
                 each attempt to connect to a PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

              o  The PATHWORKS Advanced Server must have a server-based
                 license available to assign to an unlicensed client
                 attempting to use services of the PATHWORKS Advanced
                 Server.

              In either case, the license required to access PATHWORKS
              V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) services is the
              PATHWORKS Client Access license: PWLMXXXCA07.03 or higher,
              or an equivalent client virtual license.

              If you are upgrading from PATHWORKS LAN Manager, refer to
              the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) Server
              Migration Guide for information about upgrading client
              license requests.

        1.4 About Licensing

        1.4.2 About the License Server

              The PATHWORKS License Server is an optional software
              program that you can run on your OpenVMS system to grant
              licenses to clients.

              The License Server can be installed:

              o  With the file and print server (automatically included
                 with your file and print server installation)

              o  Separately from the file and print server (called the
                 "standalone License Server")

              In either case, you can configure the License Server
              to support clients using any of the following network
              protocols:

              o  DECnet

              o  LAN Manager (NetBEUI)

              o  TCP/IP

              Compaq recommends that you install the License Server on
              a designated OpenVMS system without the PATHWORKS file
              server. (The PATHWORKS Advanced Server installation
              procedure allows you to install the License Server
              separately from the file server.) Alternatively, you
              can run the License Server on an OpenVMS Cluster with
              PATHWORKS file and print servers, where cluster failover
              provides reliability.

              Each LAN needs only one active PATHWORKS License Server.
              (The same License Server can support both PATHWORKS
              LAN Manager and PATHWORKS Advanced Server clients.) The
              license product authorization keys (PAKs) must be loaded
              on the system that runs the PATHWORKS License Server. In
              an OpenVMS Cluster, the PAKs must be loaded into a shared
              license database.

        1.5 About External Authentication

              External authentication is an optional feature of OpenVMS
              systems that allows system managers to set up user
              accounts for which login authentication is based on a
              security mechanism other than OpenVMS security.

              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server takes advantage of
              this feature by providing the ability to use the
              PATHWORKS Advanced Server or Windows NT-compatible user
              authentication mechanisms to authenticate OpenVMS user
              logins. This allows users to log in at the OpenVMS login
              prompt using the PATHWORKS Advanced Server user name and
              password. In addition, it provides automatic password
              synchronization for user accounts.

              When you install the complete PATHWORKS Advanced Server,
              the files required to support external authentication are
              automatically included in the installation process.

              When you install the Advanced Server in an OpenVMS
              Cluster, if you want to enable external authentication
              on OpenVMS Cluster member nodes on which the server is
              not running and which share the same system disk, you can
              install the standalone external authentication software
              on that disk (without installing the Advanced Server
              software). On OpenVMS Version 7.1 Alpha and VAX cluster
              members, you must copy the external authentication files
              from a system on which the Advanced Server is installed to
              the OpenVMS Version 7.1 systems.

              For more information about enabling external authen-
              tication, refer to Section 5.6, Setting Up External
              Authentication.

                All the steps except the last apply to both
                standalone and cluster Advanced Servers. The last
                step delineates what needs to be done for installing
                the Advanced Server on a cluster.

                _____________________________________________________

        1.9.1 Step 1: Check the Part Listing

              The software part listing specifies the contents of
              the kit you receive. Check the contents of your kit
              against that information. If parts are missing or your
              kit is damaged, contact your Compaq Computer Corporation
              representative.

        1.9.2 Step 2: Check the Network Hardware

              PATHWORKS Advanced Server runs on OpenVMS systems that
              meet the software requirements. The PC local area network
              (LAN) requires:

              o  A supported network controller board in the server and
                 in each client

              o  The cables to connect each client and server to the
                 network

        1.9.3 Step 3: Log In to the SYSTEM Account

              Before you install PATHWORKS Advanced Server, log in
              to the SYSTEM account, or another account that has all
              privileges enabled to run the installation procedure.

              To log in to the SYSTEM account:

              1. At the user name prompt, enter SYSTEM:

                 Username: SYSTEM

              2. At the Password prompt, enter the password to the
                 SYSTEM account. The password you enter is not
                 displayed.

                                               1.9 Preinstallation Tasks

        1.9.4 Step 4: Check the Required Software

              PATHWORKS Advanced Server requires the following:

              o  OpenVMS operating system, Alpha Version 7.3, 7.2-2,
                 7.2-1, or 6.2, or VAX Version 7.3, 7.2, or 6.2

              o  DECnet or DECnet-Plus, if you are going to use the
                 DECnet transport, the mail server, or the License
                 Server over DECnet.

              o  A TCP/IP product, if you are going to use the TCP/IP
                 for cluster or network communication. Supported TCP/IP
                 products are described in the Compaq PATHWORKS for
                 OpenVMS (Advanced Server) Release Notes.

        1.9.5 Step 5: Print and Read the Release Notes

              If you have not already read the release notes, you should
              do so before installing the software. If you choose to
              back up the system, as recommended in Section 1.9.8, Step
              8: Back Up the System, you can read the release notes
              during the backup. See Section 1.6, Reading the Release
              Notes, for more information.

        1.9.6 Step 6: Check System Parameters

              Most systems have adequate system resources readily
              available to include the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
              software. However, make sure that the following OpenVMS
              system parameters are set properly. Make any necessary
              changes to the MODPARAMS.DAT file, then run AUTOGEN, and
              reboot your system. You can delay this reboot until the
              first reboot required for backing up your system disks (a
              backup is recommended in Section 1.9.8, Step 8: Back Up
              the System).

              Make sure all other software that will be running on your
              system is indeed running before and while you run AUTOGEN.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If these parameters are not set properly, you
                cannot configure the server after you complete the
                installation procedure.

              1. Enter the following:

                 $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("PROCSECTCNT")

                 The value of the PROCSECTCNT parameter is displayed.
                 For example:

                 20

              2. If the value is less than required, edit the system
                 parameters file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and add a line
                 similar to the following:

                 MIN_PROCSECTCNT = 40

              SCSNODE parameter

              This parameter must be defined as your system's computer
              name. If you are running DECnet, the SCSNODE name should
              be the same as the DECnet node name.

              The SCSNODE parameter's preinstallation status affects
              what happens after you install, as follows:

                                          to include the new computer
                                          name. Therefore, you must
                                          requeue any existing print
                                          or batch jobs to the new
                                          queues. You may also have
                                          to rebuild the queue database.
                                          For information on these
                                          system management tasks,
                                          refer to the OpenVMS System
              ____________________________Manager's_Manual._____________

              To check whether the system parameter SCSNODE is defined
              as your system's computer name, enter the following
              commands at the system prompt:

              $ SCSNODE = F$GETSYI("SCSNODE")
              $ SHOW SYMBOL SCSNODE

              As a result, one of the following occurs:

              o  If SCSNODE is defined, the computer name is displayed.
                 For example, if your system's computer name is SPEEDY:

                 $ SHOW SYMBOL SCSNODE
                    SPEEDY

              o  If SCSNODE is not defined, the computer name is not
                 displayed.

                 If SCSNODE is not defined, edit the system parameters
                 file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and define the parameter.
                 For example, if your system's computer name is SPEEDY,
                 edit the file so that it contains the following line:

                 SCSNODE = "SPEEDY"

        Before You Install PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        1.9 Preinstallation Tasks

                 If you edit the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT, you
                 must run the OpenVMS command procedure AUTOGEN and
                 reboot the system either now or at some time before
                 configuring the server. For example:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT NOFEEDBACK

              For information about running AUTOGEN, refer to the
              OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference Manual.

        1.9.7 Step 7: Check ENQLM Process Quota

              Make sure that the ENQLM quota for the user account you
              use for configuring the Advanced Server is set to a value
              of 500 or greater. If it is not set appropriately, you
              will not be able to configure the Advanced Server after
              the installation procedure.

              To determine the current setting for this quota, enter
              the following command while logged in to the user account
              from which you will run the PWRK$CONFIG.COM configuration
              procedure:

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETJPI("", "ENQLM")

              The value of the ENQLM parameter is displayed. For
              example:

              2000

              If the value is less than required, follow these steps:

              1. Set the process default device and directory to
                 SYS$SYSTEM.

              2. At the system prompt, enter the MCR AUTHORIZE command.

              3. At the UAF prompt, enter the MODIFY command, as in
                 the following example, where user-account is the name
                 of the user account from which you will configure the
                 server, and value is a value of 500 or greater:

                 UAF> MODIFY user-account/ENQLM=value

                                               1.9 Preinstallation Tasks

        1.9.8 Step 8: Back Up the System

              To safeguard against the loss of valuable data, Compaq
              recommends that you back up all disks on your system (or
              at least the system disk) before you install any layered
              product.

              To do a system backup, use the OpenVMS BACKUP command. For
              information about the BACKUP command, refer to the OpenVMS
              System Management Utilities Reference Manual.

        1.9.9 Step 9: Check Disk Space Requirements

              To determine the number of disk blocks required for your
              installation, refer to the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
              release notes.

              To check the number of free blocks on the system disk,
              enter:

              $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

              The OpenVMS system displays information about the system
              disk, including the number of free blocks. For example:

              Device     Device     Error    Volume    Free  Trans Mnt
               Name      Status     Count     Label   Blocks Count Cnt
              DUA0:      Mounted        0    AXP072   724856   280   1

        1.9.10 Step 10: Check the Queue Manager

              It is not necessary to have the queue manager running
              during installation and configuration, but Compaq
              recommends that it be running when you configure the
              server. You can enter the SHOW QUEUE/MANAGER command to
              check whether the queue manager is running:

              $ SHOW QUEUE/MANAGER

              If the queue manager is running, your OpenVMS system
              displays a message similar to the following:

              Queue manager SYS$QUEUE_MANAGER, running, on CPEEDY::

              If the queue manager is not running, you can use the
              following command to start it:

              $ START/QUEUE/MANAGER

              For more information about the OpenVMS DCL commands, refer
              to the OpenVMS DCL Dictionary.

        1.9.11 Step 11: Check Time Zone and TDF

              To check the time zone and time differential factor (TDF)
              settings on the system, run the OpenVMS command procedure
              SYS$MANAGER:UTC$TIME_SETUP.COM. From the SYSTEM account,
              enter the following command to begin the procedure:

              $ @SYS$MANAGER:UTC$TIME_SETUP.COM

              PATHWORKS Advanced Server's internal time management uses
              Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). To properly represent the time
              in the local environment, the time zone information must
              be set up before the server is started.

              To set the time zone on your OpenVMS system, execute the
              following command procedure:

              @ SYS$MANAGER:UTC$TIMEZONE_SETUP.COM

              To set the time zone differential factor for the OpenVMS
              system, execute the following command procedure:

              @ SYS$MANAGER:UTC$CONFIGURE_TDF.COM

              If you change any time zone information, such as the
              daylight savings time setting, you must restart the server
              for the time to be properly represented.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                For diagnostic purposes, you can check the server
                log file for the values of the TDF (in seconds) and
                the daylight saving time flag.

                _____________________________________________________

              For more information on running the command procedure and
              resetting time zone and TDF, see the section on setting
              time zone information in the OpenVMS System Manager's
              Manual.

        1.9.12 Step 12: Check DECnet Status

              If you plan to use the DECnet transport, it is not
              necessary to have DECnet or DECnet-Plus running during
              the installation; however, DECnet or DECnet-Plus must be
              running on the system before you can configure the server.

              To see whether DECnet is running on the system where
              you are planning to install the server software, enter
              the appropriate command depending on whether you have
              installed DECnet (Phase IV), or DECnet-Plus, as described
              in the following sections.

        1.9.12.1 Checking DECnet (Phase IV) Status

              To check DECnet status, enter the following command:

              $ MCR NCP SHOW EXECUTOR

              o  If DECnet is running, the SHOW EXECUTOR display
                 resembles the following:

                 Node Volatile Summary as of  1-JUL-2001 12:16:36

                 Executor node = 9.000 (BRUTUS)

                 Identification  = DECnet for OpenVMS AXP V7.2

              o  If DECnet is not running, enter the following command
                 to start it:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET

        1.9.12.2 Checking DECnet-Plus Status

              If you use DECnet-Plus (formerly DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS),
              enter the following command to see whether it is running
              on the system where you are planning to install the server
              software:

              $ SHOW LOGICAL NET$STARTUP_STATUS

              o  If DECnet-Plus is running, the system displays the
                 following:

                 "NET$STARTUP_STATUS" = "RUNNING-ALL" (LNM$SYSTEM_TABLE)

              o  If DECnet-Plus is not running, enter the following
                 command to start it:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:NET$STARTUP

        1.9 Preinstallation Tasks

              For more information, refer to the DECnet product
              documentation.

        1.9.13 Step 13: Check TCP/IP Status

              If you are planning to use the TCP/IP transport, make sure
              that TCP/IP is running and that the PATHWORKS IP (PWIP)
              driver has been loaded. The procedure for starting the
              TCP/IP product and the PWIP driver differs depending on
              the TCP/IP product running on the system. Refer to the
              documentation for your TCP/IP product for information on
              how to start TCP/IP and the PWIP driver.

              For example, if TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 5
              is installed, you can start the PWIP driver manually by
              entering the following command:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:TCPIP$PWIP_STARTUP.COM

              Alternatively, you can configure TCP/IP Services for
              OpenVMS to automatically start the PWIP driver when
              TCP/IP is started, using the configuration procedure
              TCPIP$CONFIG.COM.

              For TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 4.x, use the
              configuration procedure UCX$CONFIG.COM to enable the PWIP
              driver on TCP/IP startup, or enter the following OpenVMS
              commands:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:UCX$STARTUP
              $ @SYS$STARTUP:UCX$PWIP_STARTUP

              You can add these commands to the system startup
              procedure.

              After the installation is complete, you can use the
              Configuration Manager to configure the PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server to use TCP/IP. You can do this during the
              configuration procedure (PWRK$CONFIG) or after configuring
              the server. In the former case, PWRK$CONFIG gives you
              the option of invoking the Configuration Manager. In the
              latter case, you can invoke the Configuration Manager at
              the DCL prompt by entering the ADMINISTER/CONFIG command.

                            Before You Install PATHWORKS Advanced Server
                                               1.9 Preinstallation Tasks

        1.9.14 Step 14: Check for Existing OpenVMS Server Images and
               Files

              Make sure that:

              1. No Compaq OpenVMS file and print server images (current
                 or earlier versions) are running on the local system or
                 on any member of the OpenVMS Cluster (when installing
                 on a cluster).

              2. No files from a PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) kit
                 are on the system disk. If such files are present,
                 use SYS$UPDATE:PWVN$DEINSTAL.COM (included with the
                 PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) kit) to remove those
                 files.

              3. No PATHWORKS or Advanced Server for OpenVMS images
                 reside in the SYS$SPECIFIC: directory area of the
                 system disk on which PATHWORKS will be installed.
                 (When PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
                 is installed, images in the SYS$SPECIFIC: directory
                 area will be used before the corresponding images in
                 the SYS$COMMON: directory area are used.) To remove
                 the PATHWORKS or Advanced Server (V7.2 or V7.2A) for
                 OpenVMS files, use the PWRK$DEINSTAL utility. To remove
                 the Advanced Server V7.3 for OpenVMS files, use the
                 PRODUCT REMOVE command, as documented in the Compaq
                 Advanced Server for OpenVMS Server Installation and
                 Configuration Guide.

              The server VMSINSTAL installation utility will detect if
              any of these conditions exist, and if the images or files
              are found, it will notify you. The VMSINSTAL installation
              utility automatically deletes, without notification, any
              files from a PATHWORKS Advanced Server or Advanced Server
              for OpenVMS kit found in the SYS$SPECIFIC directory tree.

        1.9.15 Step 15: Check OpenVMS Cluster Configuration

              You can run the Advanced Server on multiple OpenVMS
              Cluster members. To do so, follow these steps:

              1. An OpenVMS Cluster can include both VAX and Alpha
                 member nodes. The PATHWORKS Advanced Server can run
                 on any VAX or Alpha cluster member that is running
                 a supported version of OpenVMS. However, an OpenVMS
                 Cluster cannot support two different versions of the

        Before You Install PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        1.9 Preinstallation Tasks

                 file and print server (for example, PATHWORKS V6 for
                 OpenVMS (Advanced Server) and Advanced Server V7.3 for
                 OpenVMS).

              2. Decide which member nodes in the OpenVMS Cluster will
                 run the Advanced Server, then identify all the system
                 disks that will be used by those member nodes. Install
                 the Advanced Server on each of those system disks.

                 If the OpenVMS Cluster contains other system disks (for
                 example, to support systems running earlier versions
                 of OpenVMS), these disks might have older versions
                 of Compaq OpenVMS file and print servers installed on
                 them. If so, remove the older versions to prevent them
                 from accidentally starting up while the Advanced Server
                 is running on the current OpenVMS systems. To remove
                 the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) product,
                 execute the command procedure SYS$UPDATE:PWRK$DEINSTAL
                 from a cluster member that uses the system disk from
                 which PATHWORKS is to be removed. For more information
                 on using PWRK$DEINSTAL.COM, see Chapter 7, Removing
                 PATHWORKS Advanced Server Software. To remove the
                 Advanced Server V7.3 for OpenVMS product, use the
                 PRODUCT REMOVE command, as documented in the Compaq
                 Advanced Server for OpenVMS Server Installation and
                 Configuration Guide. To remove earlier versions of the
                 Advanced Server for OpenVMS, use PWRK$DEINSTAL.COM.
                 To remove a PATHWORKS (LAN Manager) product, use the
                 PWRK$DEINSTAL utility that was installed with the
                 product. The PATHWORKS (LAN Manager) server must be
                 stopped before you can remove it.

              3. If you plan to use the TCP/IP transport, ensure that
                 all cluster members on which the Advanced Server will
                 run are in the same TCP/IP subnet.

              4. If an earlier version of the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
                 (Advanced Server) or any other Compaq OpenVMS file and
                 print server is running on any cluster member, stop the
                 server on the cluster member system.

              5. On each system on which you want to install the
                 Advanced Server, complete the tasks described in this
                 chapter.

                                               1.9 Preinstallation Tasks

                 On each cluster member that you want to use as a file
                 and print server, you will run the Advanced Server
                 configuration command procedure (PWRK$CONFIG.COM),
                 as explained in Chapter 3, Configuring the PATHWORKS
                 Advanced Server. This ensures that each node has its
                 appropriate parameters set and enough resources to run
                 the server.

              6. All cluster members that will run the Advanced Server
                 must share a common:

                 o  System user authorization file (SYSUAF.DAT)

                 o  Rightlist file (RIGHTSLIST.DAT)

                 o  Advanced Server data directory location (PWRK$COMMONROOT:)

              7. When installing the Advanced Server on an OpenVMS
                 Cluster member, if the following two conditions apply,
                 you are must shut down the server and reboot the
                 systems running the server. (You can avoid the reboot,
                 as noted below.)

                 1. Advanced Servers are installed on two or more system
                    disks in the cluster

                 2. The Advanced Server is already running on one or
                    more cluster members that are booted from a system
                    disk other than the one on which the installation is
                    occuring

                 To avoid having to reboot the systems that are already
                 running the Advanced Server, the system administrator
                 can deassign the logical name (PWRK$REBOOT_REQUIRED)
                 that forces the reboot to occur on each affected node,
                 as follows:

                  $ DEASSIGN/SYSTEM PWRK$REBOOT_REQUIRED

                                Installing the PATHWORKS Advanced Server



              This chapter describes how to install the PATHWORKS for
              OpenVMS (Advanced Server) software. You must follow these
              procedures regardless of whether you are upgrading from a
              previous version of the server or installing the server
              for the first time.

              Before you begin the installation procedure, make sure
              that you have completed the preinstallation tasks listed
              in Chapter 1, Before You Install PATHWORKS Advanced
              Server.

              This chapter consists of the following sections:

              o  Section 2.1, About the Installation Procedure

              o  Section 2.2, Installing the Server

              o  Section 2.3, Troubleshooting Installation Problems

              o  Section 2.4, Next Steps

        2.1 About the Installation Procedure

              The following sections describe the installation procedure
              and what it does.

        2.1.1 What is VMSINSTAL?

              VMSINSTAL is the standard command procedure for installing
              software on the OpenVMS operating system. VMSINSTAL
              consists of a series of questions (prompts). Your answers
              to these questions provide VMSINSTAL with the information
              needed for installing PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

        Installing the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        2.1 About the Installation Procedure

        2.1.2 PATHWORKS Advanced Server Installation Kit

              The VMSINSTAL installation kit includes several OpenVMS
              BACKUP save sets. The save set PWRK061.A always contains
              the file KITINSTAL.COM and the release notes. The savesets
              included in the software kit are listed in the product
              release notes.

        2.1.3 What VMSINSTAL Does

              When you use VMSINSTAL, it:

              1. Determines whether the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare)
                 server is installed on the system, and if it is,
                 optionally removes the NetWare server software.

              2. Creates PATHWORKS Advanced Server accounts on the file
                 and print server, if necessary.

              3. Restores the files from the save sets in the installa-
                 tion kit.

              4. Creates DECnet objects, if you are running DECnet or
                 DECnet-Plus.

              5. Installs the PATHWORKS Advanced Server DCL command
                 definition file.

              6. Installs the PATHWORKS Advanced Server logical names
                 definition files.

              7. Deletes obsolete files.

              8. Installs the PATHWORKS Advanced Server files.

              9. Verifies that the software has been installed
                 successfully. (See Section 5.2, Verifying the PATHWORKS
                 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) Installation, for
                 information on how to run the Installation Verification
                 Procedure after installing the software.)

        2.2 Installing the Server

              The following sections describe how to prepare information
              required during the installation procedure, and how to
              specify the required information during the procedure.

                                               2.2 Installing the Server

        2.2.1 Before You Start VMSINSTAL

              Before you start the VMSINSTAL command procedure, be
              prepared to answer the following questions. The questions
              that VMSINSTAL asks depend on the software environment and
              options you select.

              1. What is the product identifier?

                 The product identifier tells VMSINSTAL which save sets
                 to copy from the media to a disk on the system. The
                 product identifier for PATHWORKS Advanced Server is:

                 PWRK061

              2. What is the name of the device on which you want to
                 mount the media?

                 The device name depends on the type of media and
                 computer you have. For example, if you want to mount a
                 CD-ROM on the CD-ROM drive of your Alphastation 400,
                 the device name might be DKA400.

              3. Do you want to access the online release notes during
                 the installation procedure?

                 You can tell VMSINSTAL to ask you whether you want
                 to display or print the online release notes during
                 installation. Because the release notes may describe
                 important changes to the installation procedure, Compaq
                 recommends that you read them. Procedures for obtaining
                 the release notes are described in Section 1.6, Reading
                 the Release Notes.

              4. Do you want to install just the Upgrade utility?

                 If the PATHWORKS (LAN Manager) server is installed on
                 the system, you are prompted to install the Upgrade
                 utility separately, which allows you to upgrade server
                 database files before you install the PATHWORKS for
                 OpenVMS (Advanced Server). Appendix D, Upgrade Utility
                 Installation, shows a sample installation of the
                 Upgrade utility.

                 To install the PATHWORKS Advanced Server, you must
                 upgrade the server databases. If you choose to
                 install just the Upgrade utility, you can install the
                 PATHWORKS Advanced Server later, after you upgrade your

        Installing the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        2.2 Installing the Server

                 databases. If you install the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
                 software, the Upgrade utility is also installed.

              5. Do you want to preserve the PATHWORKS (LAN Manager)
                 environment, and if so, where?

                 If you are upgrading from PATHWORKS (LAN Manager),
                 you can choose to have the PATHWORKS (LAN Manager)
                 data files copied to the location you specify in the
                 installation procedure. This allows you to roll back
                 to PATHWORKS (LAN Manager) later, after configuring
                 and starting the PATHWORKS Advanced Server. Refer to
                 the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
                 Server Migration Guide for more information about the
                 PATHWORKS Rollback procedure.

                 If you have V4.x of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS, you must
                 upgrade to PATHWORKS (LAN Manager) before installing
                 PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server). For
                 instructions on upgrading from V4.x to V5, refer to
                 the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
                 Server Migration Guide.

              6. Do you want to install PATHWORKS Advanced Server
                 software?

                 This option allows you to install the complete
                 PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) server,
                 including the Upgrade utility, the integrated License
                 Server, and the external authentication software.

                 Appendix B, Sample Complete Server Installation
                 and Configuration, shows a sample installation and
                 configuration of the complete PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
                 (Advanced Server) server.

              7. Do you want to install the standalone License Server?

                 If the system is designated to run the standalone
                 License Server, you can install the License Server
                 software only. Compaq recommends that you run the
                 standalone License Server on a designated License
                 Server system.

                                Installing the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
                                               2.2 Installing the Server

                 The installation procedure gives you the option to
                 install the standalone License Server software from
                 the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) software
                 kit. In this case, the complete PATHWORKS Advanced
                 Server (including the file and print server) is not
                 installed. If the complete PATHWORKS Advanced Server
                 is installed, you cannot choose the standalone License
                 Server installation option.

                 Appendix C, Sample Standalone License Server Installation
                 and Configuration, shows a sample installation and
                 configuration of the standalone License Server.

              8. Do you want to install PATHWORKS external authentica-
                 tion software only?

                 If you have installed the Advanced Server and enabled
                 external authentication in an OpenVMS Cluster that
                 includes Alpha systems running OpenVMS 7.2-1 or later
                 and VAX systems running OpenVMS 7.2 or later, and if
                 these systems boot from a system disk that will not
                 have the Advanced Server installed, you can install
                 the standalone external authentication software on that
                 system disk. For more information, see Section 1.5,
                 About External Authentication. Appendix E, Sample
                 External Authentication Installation, shows a sample
                 installation of the standalone external authentication
                 software.

              9. What is the user identification code (UIC) group
                 number?

                 The PATHWORKS Advanced Server installation procedure
                 creates the OpenVMS user accounts PWRK$DEFAULT and
                 PWRK$GUEST, if they do not already exist. When an
                 OpenVMS user account is created, it is assigned a UIC
                 group number. The default selection displayed by the
                 installation procedure is determined as follows:

                 _______________________________________________________
                 Condition__________________Default_Displayed___________

                 You are installing         The first available unused

        2.2.2 How to Respond to Prompts

              An asterisk (*) at the beginning of a line in the
              installation procedure identifies a prompt to which you
              must respond.

              Usually the prompt has a default answer, which the
              procedure displays in square brackets ([]) at the end
              of the question.

              To accept a default, press Return. For example:

              * Is the selection correct [YES]? <Return>

        2.2.3 How to Start VMSINSTAL

              When you have completed the recommended preinstallation
              tasks outlined in Chapter 1, Before You Install PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server, and have read the release notes, you
              are ready to use the VMSINSTAL installation procedure to
              install the PATHWORKS Advanced Server. To start VMSINSTAL:

              1. Ensure that you are logged in to the SYSTEM account.

              2. Load the installation kit media onto a drive. (It is
                 not necessary to mount the drive, but it must be on
                 line so that the installation procedure can mount it.)

              3. Enter the following command to check the status of the
                 device on which you have loaded the installation kit,
                 replacing device_name with the name of the applicable
                 device:

                 $ SHOW DEVICE device_name

                                               2.2 Installing the Server

                 For example:

                 $ SHOW DEVICE $1$DUS0:

                 Device             Device  Error  Volume  Free    Trans  Mnt
                  Name              Status  Count  Label   Blocks  Count  Cnt
                 $1$DUS0: (HSC001)  Mounted     0  HUBSYS  347718    628    4

                 If the device status is Offline, enter the following
                 command to place the device online, replacing device_
                 name with the name of your device:

                 $ SET DEVICE/AVAILABLE device_name

              4. Change your default directory to SYS$UPDATE:

                 $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE

              5. Check to make sure that other users are not logged in
                 to the system.

              6. If a previous version of the software is installed
                 on the system, shut it down. In a cluster, shut down
                 the software on all cluster members. For a noncluster
                 server, enter:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$SHUTDOWN

                 For a cluster server, enter:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$SHUTDOWN CLUSTER

              7. If you have DECnet configured on your system and you
                 want to create a log of the installation procedure,
                 enter the following command and then log in to the
                 system account again:

                 $ SET HOST 0/LOG=file-name

                 where file-name is the name of the file to which you
                 want the log written.

              8. Start VMSINSTAL and specify the PWRK061 product
                 identifier, the media device, and whether you
                 want access to the online release notes during the
                 installation procedure:

            ----
            Because this kit provides a new streams execlet for NetBEUI and
            TCP/IP, you MUST reboot the system to complete installation of

        Installing the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        2.2 Installing the Server



                __________Explanatory  Text for Example 2-3 __________

                In Example 2-3, Sample Installation Procedure-
                Part 3, the installation procedure checks that the
                OpenVMS system for installation of the server is
                OpenVMS Version 6.2 or later. If it is an earlier
                version, the installation would abort.

                The installation procedure then checks for circum-
                stances requiring a system reboot. A reboot might be
                needed if:

                o  A previous version of a server driver (PCF or
                   PCI) or of an execlet (PWRK$STREAMSOS_Vn.EXE),
                   was detected in memory. The previous version
                   could be from either an Advanced Server for
                   OpenVMS or PATHWORKS for OpenVMS product. Reboot
                   is required before starting the Advanced Server.

                o  System parameters were changed (in MODPARAMS.DAT),
                   or server parameters were changed in a way that
                   affected system parameters. Reboot is required
                   before configuring the Advanced Server, as
                   noted in Chapter 1, Before You Install PATHWORKS
                   Advanced Server.

                If a Compaq OpenVMS file and print server has been
                installed and started previously, certain images
                remain in system memory even after the product has
                been stopped or removed. As a result, before the
                Advanced Server can be started, you need to reboot
                the system to remove the old image from memory.

                To help minimize downtime, the installation
                procedure requests a reboot only if and when
                necessary. You are not forced to reboot after
                installation.

                In Example 2-3, Sample Installation Procedure-Part
                3, software from an earlier version of PATHWORKS

                you do not plan to run the Advanced Server on this
                system.

                The installation procedure gives you the option of
                delaying the reboot by continuing the procedure.
                You might want to delay the reboot so that you can
                complete installation or configuration processes
                that would be expedient to finish before rebooting.
                For example, when installing the server on an
                OpenVMS Cluster, you might want to delay a reboot
                until you complete the server installation and
                configuration on all nodes of the cluster.

                To delay the reboot, continuing the installation,
                enter NO at the prompt asking if you will allow a
                system shutdown after the product is installed. In
                this example, the reboot is opted for, and then the
                procedure prompts the installer for the number of
                minutes to elapse before the shutdown occurs.

                The installer is also prompted whether an automatic
                system reboot is requested, whether the installation
                verification procedure should be run after the
                installation, and whether to purge files replaced by
                this installation or keep previous versions intact.
                The installation verification procedure (IVP) can be
                run automatically, as shown in Example 2-5, Sample
                Installation Procedure-Part 5, or independently
                of the installation procedure, as described in
                Section 5.2, Verifying the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
                (Advanced Server) Installation.

                      User Accounts and User Identification Codes (UICs)
                      --------------------------------------------------

          PATHWORKS for OpenVMS creates two OpenVMS accounts: a default account,
          PWRK$DEFAULT, and  a guest account, PWRK$GUEST.  The default UIC group
          number for both these new accounts depends on the following:

          o If you are installing the server for the first time, the default is
            the first unused UIC group number, starting with 360.

          o If there is an existing account PCFS$ACCOUNT, the default is the UIC
            group number associated with PCFS$ACCOUNT.

          o If there is an existing account PWRK$DEFAULT or PWRK$GUEST, the
            default is the UIC group number associated with PWRK$DEFAULT or
            PWRK$GUEST, in preference to PCFS$ACCOUNT.  However, the default
            UIC group number will
            not be used to change the UIC of any existing accounts.

            For more information about UIC group numbers, see the OpenVMS System
            Manager's Manual.

        * Enter default UIC group number for PWRK$DEFAULT and PWRK$GUEST [360]:
        <Return>

            All questions have been answered.  The installation of
            PATHWORKS for OpenVMS will continue.

                In Example 2-4, Sample Installation Procedure-
                Part 4, the script prompts for a default UIC group
                number. It does so only if you are installing the
                complete PATHWORKS Advanced Server product. If you
                do not want to associate the newly created OpenVMS
                accounts PWRK$DEFAULT and PWRK$GUEST with the
                default user identification code (UIC) group number,
                specify another three-digit UIC group number.

                At this point, all questions have been answered and
                the installation process continues. The installation
                procedure then reminds the installer to continue
                with the configuration process by invoking the
                PWRK$CONFIG.COM configuration procedure.

              an environment that is not appropriate.

        2.3.1 Installing PATHWORKS Advanced Server on a System Running
              Another Advanced Server Image

              If you attempt to install the PATHWORKS Advanced Server on
              a system, or anywhere in a cluster, on which a PATHWORKS
              for OpenVMS or Advanced Server for OpenVMS image is
              running, the installation procedure displays a message
              such as the following:

        ******************************************************************
        * You must shut down the Advanced Servers on all nodes in the
        * cluster before you continue installing PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS.
        ******************************************************************

        If you do not shut down the servers, the installation will
        terminate.

              Shut down the servers on all nodes in the cluster before
              continuing your installation.

        2.3.2 Installing the PATHWORKS Advanced Server on a System with
              the NetWare Server

              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server cannot be installed on a
              system where the NetWare server is installed. If you at-
              tempt to install the PATHWORKS Advanced Server on a system
              where the NetWare server is installed, the installation
              procedure optionally invokes the NetWare server software
              removal procedure (SYS$STARTUP:PWVN$DEINSTAL.COM).

              When the installation procedure detects the presence of
              the NetWare server, it displays the following message and
              question:

              %PWRKV60-E-OLDVERPWNV, PATHWORKS V6.0-nnnx for OpenVMS (NetWare)
              was previously installed.  This product is no longer supported.
              To install the PATHWORKS V6.1 for OpenVMS product, the NetWare
              product must be deinstalled.

              * Will you allow this installation procedure to deinstall
              * the NetWare product [NO]?

                               2.3 Troubleshooting Installation Problems

              To remove the NetWare server software, enter YES.

              To terminate the installation procedure without removing
              the NetWare server software, enter NO, or press <Return>.

              You can remove the NetWare server manually using the
              procedure in Section 7.2, Removing the PATHWORKS NetWare
              Server. Then start the VMSINSTAL procedure again after the
              NetWare server has been removed.

        2.3.3 Installing PATHWORKS Advanced Server on a System with
              PATHWORKS (LAN Manager)

              You can upgrade PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
              to PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server). If the
              system has PATHWORKS (LAN Manager) installed, you can use
              the Upgrade utility, as described in the Compaq PATHWORKS
              for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) Server Migration Guide, to
              upgrade server information before you configure and start
              the PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

        2.3.4 Installing the Standalone License Server on a System
              Where the PATHWORKS Advanced Server Has Been Installed

              If you install the standalone License Server on a system
              where the PATHWORKS Advanced Server has been installed,
              the installation procedure displays the following message:

              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server was previously installed and you
              have selected to install the License Server only.  Because the
              PATHWORKS Advanced Server includes the License Server, the
              complete PATHWORKS Advanced Server must be installed.

              The installation procedure will choose to install
              the PATHWORKS Advanced Server. You have the option of
              continuing with this installation, or you can terminate
              the installation procedure by pressing <Ctrl/Y>. To
              install the standalone License Server on this system,
              you must first remove the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
              software using the PWRK$DEINSTAL.COM command procedure, as
              described in Chapter 7, Removing PATHWORKS Advanced Server
              Software. Then start the VMSINSTAL procedure again.

              For a sample installation and configuration script for
              the standalone license server, see Appendix C, Sample
              Standalone License Server Installation and Configuration.

        2.3 Troubleshooting Installation Problems

        2.3.5 Installing the External Authentication Software

              You cannot install the external authentication software
              only, if you have previously installed the PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server. The installation procedure displays
              the following message if you try to install the external
              authentication images under these circumstances:

        The PATHWORKS Advanced Server was previously installed, and you
        have selected
        to install the external authentication images only. Because the
        PATHWORKS Advanced Server includes the external authentication images,
        the
        complete PATHWORKS Advanced Server must also be installed.

              You must remove the PATHWORKS Advanced Server software
              to be able to select this option. To remove PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server software, run the PWRK$DEINSTAL procedure,
              as described in Chapter 7, Removing PATHWORKS Advanced
              Server Software.

              For a sample installation script for the external
              authentication images, see Appendix E, Sample External
              Authentication Installation.

                               Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server



              This chapter describes how to configure the PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server and consists of the following sections:

              o  Section 3.1, About the Advanced Server Configuration
                 Procedure

              o  Section 3.2, Before You Start the Advanced Server
                 Configuration Procedure

              o  Section 3.3, How to Start the Advanced Server

              o  Section 3.9, Next Steps

        3.1 About the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

              The Advanced Server initial configuration procedure,
              PWRK$CONFIG.COM, is installed by the PATHWORKS Advanced
              Server installation procedure. Like the installation
              procedure, the configuration procedure asks you a series
              of questions (by displaying prompts). The procedure uses
              your answers to configure the PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

        Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        3.1 About the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

              You can use the PWRK$CONFIG.COM configuration procedure to
              reconfigure the server at any time later. Note that the
              script contents change after the first configuration.

        3.1.1 What the Configuration Procedure Does

              PWRK$CONFIG.COM is a command procedure that:

              o  Creates the PATHWORKS Advanced Server on-disk
                 structure. (Appendix F, PATHWORKS Advanced Server Files
                 and On-Disk Structure, shows the on-disk structure).

              o  Upgrades any existing file and print server user
                 account and share databases, such as when upgrading
                 the server from a previous version.

              o  If configuring a previously configured server, stores
                 the original accounts database in specially-created
                 directories. (For more information, see Section 3.7.2,
                 If Problems Occur When Reconfiguring the Advanced
                 Server.)

              o  Allows you to enter the Configuration Manager to modify
                 system configuration parameters and to verify the
                 configuration setting against the available system
                 resources. For example, you can specify the transports
                 the server will run and the maximum number of clients
                 that can connect to the server simultaneously.

                 For more information about the Configuration Manager,
                 refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced
                 Server) Server Administrator's Guide.

              o  Creates the PATHWORKS Advanced Server user account and
                 share databases.

              o  Allows you to modify server configuration default
                 settings such as server role, domain name, and the
                 services that are enabled.

              o  On a server that will run as a primary domain
                 controller or member server, allows you to specify
                 the Administrator account password.

              o  Gives you the option of starting the server.

                               Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
                   3.1 About the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

              After you install the server, you must run PWRK$CONFIG.COM
              before you can start the server. In an OpenVMS Cluster,
              before you start the server on any node, you must run
              PWRK$CONFIG.COM on each node where you plan to run the
              server. Although the nodes in an OpenVMS Cluster function
              as a single unit in a domain, treat them as individual
              units for purposes of configuration.

        3.2 Before You Start the Advanced Server Configuration
            Procedure

              Before you start the PWRK$CONFIG.COM command procedure,
              check that the ENQLM quota system process parameter
              for the user account from which you will run the
              PWRK$CONFIG.COM procedure is set to a value of 500 or
              greater. For information on how to determine the current
              setting and how to increase the value, see Section 1.9.7,
              Step 7: Check ENQLM Process Quota. In addition, check
              the system parameters discussed in Section 1.9.6, Step 6:
              Check System Parameters.

              Be prepared to answer the questions discussed in the
              following sections. The questions asked by PWRK$CONFIG.COM
              depend on the options you select and on such factors as
              server role and whether you are configuring the server to
              join a new or existing domain.

        3.2.1 On What OpenVMS Disk Device Do You Want to Store the
              Advanced Server Data Files?

              The data files include:

              o  Configuration parameter files

              o  License Server data files

              o  Log files

              o  Printer spool files

              o  Server data files

              o  Security Account Manager (SAM) database files

              o  Client-based server administration tools and license
                 kits

              o  Virtual memory section files

                           Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server 3-3

 



        Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        3.2 Before You Start the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

              By default, the configuration procedure copies the data
              files to the system device (SYS$SYSDEVICE). However, you
              can specify any existing OpenVMS disk device that has at
              least 85,000 free blocks of disk space. The amount needed
              depends on the components installed.

              When you select a disk for the Advanced Server data files,
              keep the following in mind:

              o  The Advanced Server frequently accesses the data
                 files copied to the specified disk device, which
                 generates input to and output from the disk. Having
                 these operations occur on the system disk can degrade
                 the performance of both the OpenVMS system and the
                 Advanced Server. Therefore, Compaq recommends that you
                 specify a disk device other than the system disk.

              o  On an OpenVMS Cluster with multiple system disks, all
                 nodes on which you plan to run the Advanced Server must
                 use the same disk device to store and access Advanced
                 Server data files. Using separate disks on separate
                 cluster members is strictly prohibited.

              o  You can run the PWRK$CONFIG.COM command procedure at
                 any time, to change the disk device where Advanced
                 Server data files are stored. PWRK$CONFIG.COM
                 automatically copies the data files to the new location
                 and deletes the data files from the current location.

        3.2.2 Do You Want to Change the System Configuration Parameters
              Now?

              If you respond "YES" to the prompt to change the system
              configuration parameters, the Configuration Manager
              starts. The Configuration Manager is a utility that
              allows you to modify and verify the system environment
              configuration parameter settings, such as the maximum
              number of clients that can connect to the server, the
              percentage of physical memory the server can use, and
              which network transports the server uses.

              You can change the system configuration parameter
              settings after starting the Advanced Server by using
              the Configuration Manager (invoking the Configuration
              Manager with the ADMINISTER/CONFIGURATION command
              at the DCL prompt). For more information, refer to

        3.2 Before You Start the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

              the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
              Server Administrator's Guide. Section B.2, Sample
              Server Configuration, shows the basic Configuration
              Manager screen displayed when you opt to change the
              system configuration parameter settings during use of
              PWRK$CONFIG.COM.

        3.2.2.1 Configuring Transports for a Backup Domain Controller
                or Member Server

              If you are configuring a server as a backup domain
              controller (BDC) or a member server, you must select
              at least one transport that is also used by the primary
              domain controller (PDC). Otherwise, the configuration will
              fail.

              When you select the transports to run on a server that
              will participate in wide area networking, keep the
              following in mind:

              o  In a wide area network, the TCP/IP transport is
                 required. (DECnet also supports wide area networks
                 but the functionality it provides is not as extensive
                 as that provided by TCP/IP.) In a cluster, all Advanced
                 Server members must be in the same subnet.

              o  If you are configuring a BDC or member server to join
                 an existing domain where the PDC is on a different
                 TCP/IP subnet, both the server you are configuring
                 and the PDC must be configured to use the TCP/IP
                 transport, and you must set up wide area networking
                 using either a WINS (Windows Internet Name Service)
                 Server, a Domain Name System (DNS) server, or an
                 LMHOSTS file for NetBIOS name resolution, as described
                 in Chapter 6, Implementing a Wide Area Network. (You
                 can select one, two, or all three of these methods for
                 name resolution.)

              o  If you are using WINS for network name resolution, the
                 PDC and any BDCs and member servers should use a WINS
                 Server to provide NetBIOS name resolution.

                 If your Advanced Server will run in an OpenVMS Cluster,
                 to gain the benefits of load balancing and failover,

                 Server does not dynamically register the Advanced
                 Server cluster alias with the WINS server. Therefore,
                 you should define a static multihomed entry for the
                 Advanced Server alias in the WINS database. For more
                 information, see Section 6.3.1, Setting up WINS Support
                 for OpenVMS Clusters. If you plan to use DNS for
                 NetBIOS name resolution, you do not define this static
                 multihomed entry in the WINS database. (If Windows 95,
                 Windows 98, or Windows NT clients are configured to
                 use both WINS and DNS for NetBIOS name resolution, they
                 first query the WINS server to resolve the name.)

              o  If you are using the LMHOSTS file, it must be set up on
                 the PDC as well as the BDCs and member servers. Before
                 you configure any BDC or member server that is not on
                 the same subnet as the PDC, make sure that a special
                 NetBIOS name entry for the PDC is in the LMHOSTS file
                 on that BDC or member server; otherwise, the BDC or
                 member server will not find the PDC and will fail
                 to join the existing domain. This NetBIOS name entry
                 should be the same as the domain name, space padded to
                 15 characters, with the hexadecimal control character
                 1B appended to it. You map the IP address of the PDC
                 to this special name. For example, if the domain name
                 is LANGROUP and the PDC of LANGROUP is DOMPDC with an
                 IP address of 10.20.30.40, the BDCs and member servers
                 would need to add the following lines to their LMHOSTS
                 file:

                 10.20.30.40  DOMPDC  #PRE  #DOM:LANGROUP
                 10.20.30.40 "LANGROUP       \0x1B"  #PRE

                 Note that the total number of characters within the
                 quotes should always be 20 characters (the domain name
                 padded to 15 characters, plus the five characters
                 required for the hexadecimal control character
                 (\0x1B)).

                 For more information, see Chapter 6, Implementing a
                 Wide Area Network.

                 If your Advanced Server will run in an OpenVMS Cluster,
                 other domain controllers (including the PDC) that are
                 not in the same subnet as the Advanced Server cluster
                 must add an entry for the Advanced Server cluster

        3.2 Before You Start the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

                 alias to their LMHOSTS file. This assumes they are
                 not using other methods (WINS or DNS) for resolving
                 NetBIOS names. For domain operations, all the domain
                 controllers in the cluster operate as a single domain
                 controller identified by the Advanced Server cluster
                 alias name, rather than by the specific computer names
                 of the individual cluster members. However, because
                 the LMHOSTS file does not offer any means for mapping
                 multiple IP addresses to a single NetBIOS name, the
                 entry for the Advanced Server cluster alias must be
                 mapped to the IP address of one specific server cluster
                 member. If the Advanced Server is stopped on that
                 cluster member, you must modify the LMHOSTS file on
                 all clients and servers to map the cluster alias name
                 to the IP address of a cluster member on which the
                 Advanced Server is still running. On systems running a
                 Microsoft Windows operating system, the NetBIOS name
                 cache must also be reloaded using the command NBTSTAT
                 -R (capital R required).

                 Due to the LMHOSTS limitations noted above, it is
                 difficult (and perhaps unmanageable) to gain the
                 benefits of load balancing and failover using an
                 LMHOSTS file.

              o  If your Advanced Server runs in an OpenVMS Cluster
                 and you have it set up for cluster load balancing
                 using DNS, then enable the use of DNS for NetBIOS
                 name resolution on all servers and clients. Remove
                 any entries for the Advanced Server cluster alias from
                 the LMHOSTS file and WINS database. Compaq strongly
                 recommends that the Advanced Server cluster alias not
                 be the same as the TCP/IP cluster alias (referred
                 to as the TCP/IP cluster impersonator name). For
                 information on setting up load balancing, refer to
                 the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)

        3.2.3 Do You Want to Change Any of the Server Configuration
              Settings?

              The server configuration settings determine:

              o  Whether the License Server runs

                 The License Server is a software program that you
                 can run on your OpenVMS system to grant client-based
                 licenses. Any client that wants to use server resources
                 must have a valid license. Each local area network
                 (LAN) needs only one License Server. The client license
                 product authorization keys (PAKs) must be loaded on the
                 system that runs the License Server.

                 In an OpenVMS Cluster, the PAKs must be loaded in
                 a shared license database available to all cluster
                 members.

                 The License Server runs only if you enable it with the
                 configuration procedure.

                 -  If you are using client-based licensing, you must
                    run the License Server. Compaq recommends that
                    you run the License Server on a different system
                    than the Advanced Server. See Section 1.4, About
                    Licensing, for more information.

                 -  If you are using server-based licenses, you do not
                    need to run the License Server.

                 By default, the License Server does not run.

              o  Whether the Timesource service runs

                 The Timesource service allows your server to act
                 as a time server. Other servers on the network can
                 synchronize with the time server to coordinate network
                 events (for example, running batch programs on all
                 computers the same time each day). Each LAN needs only
                 one time server.

                 By default, the Timesource service does not run.

              o  Whether the Alerter service runs

                 The Alerter service sends messages called alerts to
                 servers and clients that run the Messenger service.

                 By default, the Alerter service runs.

              o  Names of the users who receive alert messages

                               Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        3.2 Before You Start the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

                 By default, alert messages are sent to the Administrator
                 account.

              o  Whether the NetLogon service is enabled.

                 In a domain, the NetLogon service distributes a domain-
                 wide user accounts database to all domain controllers
                 running NetLogon. The service allows for single domain-
                 wide logon that enables users to access resources on
                 any server in the domain. The NetLogon service is
                 required for smooth operation of the domain; Compaq
                 recommends that the NetLogon service always be enabled,
                 even on a member server.

                 By default, the NetLogon service runs.

              o  Domain name

                 This is the domain in which your server is located.
                 A domain is a subdivision of clients and servers on
                 the network. For more information on domains, refer
                 to the Compaq Advanced Server for OpenVMS Concepts and
                 Planning Guide and the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
                 (Advanced Server) Server Administrator's Guide.

                 The default domain name is LANGROUP. You can specify a
                 name that reflects your company or group.

              o  Role of the server

                 This is the role of the server in the domain. You can
                 designate an Advanced Server as either the primary
                 domain controller (PDC), a backup domain controller
                 (BDC), or a member server. When you install the
                 Advanced Server in a new domain, the new server becomes
                 the PDC by default. In an OpenVMS Cluster, all nodes
                 on the cluster have the same role: when you change the
                 role of one, the change applies to all the servers on
                 the cluster.

                 For more details on configuring the server domain role,
                 see Section 3.6, Configuring the Advanced Server Domain
                 Role.

              o  Computer name

                 This unique name identifies your server in the domain.
                 You define this name or accept the default value when
                 you run the configuration procedure.

        Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        3.2 Before You Start the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

                 The PWRK$CONFIG.COM procedure will not prevent you
                 from specifying the same named PDC if another node or
                 cluster has previously been defined and is running in
                 that role. However, on the new (duplicate) PDC, the
                 NetLogon service will not be started. The PDC must be
                 unique in the domain.

                 The default computer name is the same as the server's
                 SCSNODE name.

              o  Advanced Server cluster alias

                 If your server is a member of an OpenVMS Cluster, this
                 is the name that all servers in the cluster share. The
                 alias lets remote nodes (including clients) treat all
                 server members in the cluster as a single server. For
                 example, a client user can specify the Advanced Server
                 cluster alias to connect to any server in the cluster;
                 the user need not know the specific node in the cluster
                 to which it is connected.

                 If DECnet has been configured to run in the cluster,
                 the default Advanced Server cluster alias is the same
                 as the DECnet cluster alias. If a DECnet alias is not
                 defined, the default Advanced Server cluster alias
                 is nodename_ALIAS, where nodename is the SCSNODE name
                 of the cluster member from which you initially run
                 PWRK$CONFIG.COM.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Compaq strongly recommends that the Advanced Server
                cluster alias and the TCP/IP cluster alias (referred
                to as the TCP/IP impersonator cluster name) be
                different.

                Do not use the name of the domain as the Advanced
                Server cluster alias; if they are the same, the
                NetLogon service will fail to start.

                _____________________________________________________

              o  Server announce comment

                 This is the text that the Advanced Server displays when
                 it announces its presence on the network and when you
                 display a list of available servers.

                 The default server announce comment is "PATHWORKS V6.1
                 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)."

              For more information about changing configuration
              settings, see Section 3.5, How to Change Default

              For more information about each server configuration
              setting, refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
              (Advanced Server) Server Administrator's Guide.

        3.2.4 What Do You Want the Administrator Account Password to
              Be?

              If you are configuring a PDC, the configuration procedure
              prompts you to specify the password to be set for the
              domain Administrator account. If you are configuring a
              member server, the configuration procedure prompts you for
              the member server's local Administrator account password
              to be set. The member server's local Administrator
              account password gives access to the member server's
              local security account database. As with Windows NT, there
              may be situtations where you would like to allow certain
              people to manage a member server's local database without
              giving them the ability to manage the entire domain.

              Passwords are case sensitive and can contain up to 14
              characters. Valid characters are alphanumeric characters
              and any of the following special characters:

              ! # $ % & () - . ^ _ ` { } ~

        3.2.5 Are You Going to Supply Account/Password Information?

              If you are configuring your server to join an existing
              domain (as a BDC or member server), you can either:

              o  Have the computer added to the domain manually by the
                 domain administrator

              o  Have the computer added by supplying an administrator
                 account user name and password during execution of the
                 configuration procedure

        Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        3.2 Before You Start the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

              The former option is useful if the domain administrator
              does not wish to give out the user name and password of
              the Administrator account in the domain to the person
              configuring this server to join the domain. The domain
              administrator can use the ADMINISTER ADD COMPUTER command
              or the Windows NT Server Manager to add the computer
              to the domain. If this is the case, answer NO to this
              prompt, and you will not be prompted for account/password
              information.

              With the latter option, the configuration procedure re-
              quests the domain's PDC to add the computer to the domain.
              You will be prompted for a domain administrator account
              user name and password, as explained in Section 3.2.6,
              What Is the Domain Administrator Password?.

        3.2.6 What Is the Domain Administrator Password?

              When you choose to have the computer added automatically
              by the configuration procedure, you are prompted for a
              domain administrator account user name and password.
              As noted in Section 3.2.5, Are You Going to Supply
              Account/Password Information?, the PDC is requested
              to add the computer to the domain. The PDC validates
              the account user name and password on behalf of the
              configuration procedure. Enter the password, observing
              the rules specified in Section 3.2.4, What Do You Want the
              Administrator Account Password to Be?.

        3.2.7 Do You Want to Enter a New Administrator Account
              Password?

              In certain cases, you are prompted whether you want to
              enter a new Administrator password. This gives you the
              opportunity to change the password.

        3.2.8 Do You Want to Start the Server?

              The configuration procedure asks you if you want to start
              the Advanced Server. If you do not want to start the
              Advanced Server at this time, you can do so later from the
              command line after the configuration procedure completes.

        3.2 Before You Start the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

              Before you start the server on any OpenVMS Cluster member,
              Compaq recommends that you configure the Advanced Server
              on each cluster member that you want to use as a server.
              You can then use the SYSMAN utility to start the server
              on all cluster members. If you choose to start the server
              individually on each cluster member, make sure that you
              do so from the SYSTEM account (or a similar account) on
              each server node. For more information, see Section 5.3.5,
              How to Start the PATHWORKS Advanced Server in an OpenVMS
              Cluster.

              For detailed information on alternate ways to start the
              server, see Section 5.3, Starting the PATHWORKS Advanced
              Server.

        3.3 How to Start the Advanced Server Configuration Procedure

              After the installation procedure completes, the OpenVMS
              system prompt ($) is displayed. If the system was
              rebooted following installation, log in to the SYSTEM
              account or an equivalent account. If the system was
              not rebooted, ensure that you are logged in to such
              an account. Then, start the configuration procedure by
              entering:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:PWRK$CONFIG

              In an OpenVMS Cluster, PWRK$CONFIG.COM must be run on each
              member node on which the server is to run. If you first
              start the server at any node, and then attempt to run the
              PWRK$CONFIG.COM configuration procedure, the procedure
              will shut down the server.

              Prompts, tells you how to respond to the prompts that
              PWRK$CONFIG.COM displays.

        3.6 Configuring the Advanced Server Domain Role

              Depending on the domain type, the Advanced Server can
              participate in a domain as the PDC, a BDC, or a member
              server.

              The Advanced Server may participate in three kinds of
              domains:

              o  Windows NT domains, in which Advanced Servers can
                 participate as a PDC, BDCs, and member servers.

              o  Windows 2000 mixed-mode domains, which are domains
                 that include both Windows 2000 domain controllers
                 and Windows NT or Compaq Advanced Server domain
                 controllers; Advanced Servers can participate as BDCs
                 and as member servers.

              o  Windows 2000 native-mode domains (also referred to
                 as pure Windows 2000 domains), which are domains in
                 which all domain controllers are Windows 2000 systems;
                 Advanced Servers can participate as member servers
                 only.

              Table 3-3, Advanced Server Roles in Different Domain
              Types, lists for each type of domain the roles the server
              can take.

              Each Windows NT domain must have one PDC. The PDC
              stores the domain's master copy of the security accounts
              database.

              When you install the Advanced Server to create a new
              Windows NT domain, the new server becomes the PDC by
              default. When you install server software and specify
              an existing domain name, the server can join the existing
              domain only as a BDC or member server.

              A domain does not require BDCs, but one or more are
              recommended. A BDC keeps a copy of the domain's master
              security accounts database. The copy of the security
              accounts database stored on BDCs is synchronized with
              the PDC's master database. In this way, PDCs and BDCs can
              validate logon requests in the domain.

              A member server does not store a copy of the domain's
              security accounts database and does not validate logon
              requests. Member servers rely on domain controllers to
              validate credentials of users requesting access to member
              server shares. The advantages of configuring the Advanced
              Server as a member server are listed in Section 3.6.1,
              Configuring the Advanced Server as a Member Server.

                         3.6 Configuring the Advanced Server Domain Role

              In an OpenVMS Cluster, all nodes on the cluster must have
              the same role. If you change the role of one node, the
              other nodes are automatically changed to that role.

              When you configure the Advanced Server for the first
              time, you select the role your server will perform in the
              domain. At times you may need to change the role of your
              server. The method you use to change the server depends on
              the current role of the server and the role to which you
              want to change it. To change the role of the server from a
              BDC to a PDC, or from a PDC to a BDC, use the ADMINISTER
              SET COMPUTER/ROLE command. To change a server BDC to a
              member server, you must use PWRK$CONFIG.COM, as explained
              in Section 3.6.1, Configuring the Advanced Server as a
              Member Server. To change a PDC to a member server, you
              must first promote another BDC to a PDC; then the original
              PDC is demoted automatically to a BDC, after which you
              can use PWRK$CONFIG.COM to change it to a member server.
              Use PWRK$CONFIG.COM also to change a member server to a
              BDC. (This restriction is similar to but less restrictive
              than that of Windows NT, which requires the operating
              system to be reinstalled to change a domain controller
              to a member server, or vice versa.) For more information
              on changing the role of the server from a BDC to a PDC,
              or vice versa, refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
              (Advanced Server) Server Administrator's Guide. Table 3-4,
              Methods for Changing Server Roles, summarizes which role
              changes are allowed and disallowed by PWRK$CONFIG.COM.

                If you reconfigure a BDC as a member server,
                PWRK$CONFIG.COM automatically removes the domain

                If you reconfigure a member server to a BDC,
                PWRK$CONFIG.COM automatically removes the member
                server's local user account database.

                In either case, because of loss of local group
                information, access to some resources might be
                affected. If resource permissions have been set
                using local groups, those permissions will have
                to be reset. If resource permissions have been set
                using global groups or global user accounts, those
                permissions will remain in effect after the role
                change.

                         3.6 Configuring the Advanced Server Domain Role

        3.6.1 Configuring the Advanced Server as a Member Server

              Use the PWRK$CONFIG.COM configuration procedure to
              configure the Advanced Server to participate in a domain
              as a member server. You cannot use the ADMINISTER SET
              COMPUTER/ROLE command to change an Advanced Server domain
              controller to a member server role or to change a member
              server to a domain controller role.

              You can configure the Advanced Server as a member server
              if it is joining an existing domain that has a PDC in
              operation.

              You may want to configure your Advanced Server as a member
              server instead of a BDC (or PDC) for any of the following
              reasons:

              o  Member servers do not spend time validating logon
                 requests. Thus, this role can be a good choice for
                 servers that have heavy workloads or that perform
                 extremely time-critical tasks.

              o  More important, configuring one or more servers as mem-
                 ber servers rather than as domain controllers can help
                 decrease the network load, thereby eliminating network
                 traffic normally generated by domain controllers for
                 replicating user databases and for authenticating logon
                 requests. When a client attempts to find a logon server
                 to authenticate a request, all domain controllers
                 respond to the request. In some environments, this
                 can generate a significant load on the network.

              o  Configuring the Advanced Server as a member server
                 allows the Advanced Server to participate in a Windows
                 2000 native-mode environment without interruption to
                 that environment.

              o  If in the future your PATHWORKS Advanced Server server
                 is moved to a different domain, it is simpler to move
                 it as a member server from one domain to another than
                 to move it as a BDC.

              The next two sections explain how to configure the
              Advanced Server as a member server: Section 3.6.1.1,
              Configuring a New PATHWORKS Advanced Server as a Member
              Server, and Section 3.6.1.2, Configuring an Existing
              PATHWORKS Advanced Server BDC As a Member Server.

        3.6.1.1 Configuring a New PATHWORKS Advanced Server as a Member
                Server

              While installing a new PATHWORKS Advanced Server in an
              existing domain, you can configure it as a member server
              during the PWRK$CONFIG.COM configuration procedure. The
              domain must include one active PDC.

              The following PWRK$CONFIG.COM output shows how a new
              PATHWORKS Advanced Server server might be configured
              as a member server. As shown, you must first specify
              an existing domain (in this case, UPTIME). This example
              assumes the UPTIME domain is a Windows 2000 native-mode
              domain that already has one or more domain controllers.

        Reading current configuration parameters ...

          Your Advanced Server for OpenVMS is presently configured to
          run as follows:

          An Advanced Server domain is a collection of computers that share
          a common security database and policy.  Each domain has a unique
          name.  A network can have many domains.

          The Advanced Server domain name can be up to 15 characters
          long.  The domain name must be different than the computer name.

        Enter item number, or RETURN to use these values [DONE]: 6 <Return>

          The Advanced Server role is the part the server will play in its
          domain.

          A primary domain controller maintains the domain's master user
          accounts database and validates logins.

          A backup domain controller receives copies of the master database,
          validates logins, and can be promoted to primary.

          A member server does not receive copies of the master database
          or validate logins.  It relies on domain controllers to validate
          user credentials.

        Enter the role of this server (P)rimary/(B)ackup/(M)ember [P]:
        M <Return>

          Before joining a domain, the computer must be added to the
          domain.  This can be done in one of two ways:

              - the administrator of the domain uses the administrative
                tools to add this computer to the domain, or

              - the computer is added automatically by this procedure;
                you must supply an administrator account and password

        3.6.1.2 Configuring an Existing PATHWORKS Advanced Server BDC
                As a Member Server

              When you configure a BDC to become a member server, the
              script is similar to the one for configuring a new server
              as a member server. One exception is that the script will
              display the following lines:

         Changing from backup domain controller to member server
         results in the re-creation of the Advanced Server SAM databases.
         If there is any problem with the configuration, your existing SAM
         databases will be restored.

              The BDC's domain-wide account database is removed, and
              the member server's local database is created. Server-
              specific data is retained from the BDC's database. The
              configuration procedure saves the domain-wide account
              database in case you need to restore it later (for more
              information, see Section 3.7.2, If Problems Occur When
              Reconfiguring the Advanced Server).

              The following two displays show the role of server
              LIONHEART before and after reconfiguration to the member
              server role. The display symbol for a member server is
              [SV].

        3.7 Troubleshooting Configuration Procedure Problems

              The following sections describe:

              o  How to ensure sufficient resources will be available to
                 support clients

              o  How to recover if problems occur when reconfiguring the
                 Advanced Server

        3.7.1 Ensuring Sufficient Resources to Support Clients

              PATHWORKS Advanced Server requests the resources that
              it needs using the OpenVMS AUTOGEN utility. If AUTOGEN
              underestimates the resources required for use by processes
              other than PATHWORKS Advanced Server, and these resources
              have already been consumed when PATHWORKS Advanced Server
              is started, there may be insufficient resources left for
              PATHWORKS Advanced Server to support the desired number of
              clients.

              To ensure sufficient resource allocation to support
              clients, make sure that all software that will run
              concurrently with PATHWORKS Advanced Server is installed
              and started before you run the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
              configuration procedure. If TCP/IP is selected as a

                    3.7 Troubleshooting Configuration Procedure Problems

              transport, make sure that the TCP/IP product is loaded
              before you run the PWRK$CONFIG.COM procedure.

              After you successfully configure the PATHWORKS Advanced
              Server, it may not start, reporting that there are
              insufficient resources to support any clients. In this
              case, examine the following file to determine the system
              resource that needs to be increased (nodename is the name
              of the server node):

              PWRK$LOGS:PWRK$CONFIG_ERROR_node.LOG

              To increase the resource allocation, make the appropriate
              modifications to the MODPARAMS.DAT file and then
              run AUTOGEN. Refer to Chapter 1, Before You Install
              PATHWORKS Advanced Server, for more information about
              the requirements for system parameter settings.

        3.7.2 If Problems Occur When Reconfiguring the Advanced Server

              If you reconfigure a previously configured server, the
              PWRK$CONFIG.COM command procedure creates subdirectories
              in the PWRK$LMDOMAINS: and PWRK$LMDATAFILES: directories,
              and stores the original accounts database files there.

              The names of the subdirectories are based on the date and
              time, such as 16JUN20014314818.DIR, indicating that the
              directory was created on 16-JUN-2000 at approximately 2:32
              p.m.

              If an error occurs during configuration, the server con-
              figuration will be returned to its original state. After
              you are confident you have a successful reconfiguration,
              you can manually delete these subdirectories and their
              contents.

        3.8 The Advanced Server Network Adapter

              PATHWORKS might need to use the network to communicate
              with the PDC. If the system has more than one network
              adapter (also referred to as a network interface card),
              the default adapter chosen by PATHWORKS might not be the
              correct interface. Or, on some newer systems, the Advanced
              Server might not recognize the only network adapter
              present. In such cases, you can define system logical
              names to direct the Advanced Server to use a specific

                          Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server 3-31

 



        Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        3.8 The Advanced Server Network Adapter

              interface. If no such logical is defined, PATHWORKS
              selects the first adapter (alphabetically) defined on
              your system from a list of known adapters.

              If the server has access to more than one network adapter
              and you do not want to use the adapter selected, or if
              the system has a network adapter that is not found or
              recognized by the Advanced Server, you can manually
              specify the network adapter to use with the transport
              you specified.

        3.8.1 Manually Defining the Network Adapter

              To manually define the network adapter to be used for a
              specific protocol (after restarting the server), follow
              these steps:

              1. Use the DCL command DEFINE/SYSTEM to define a system
                 logical name that specifies the network adapter, as
                 shown in the following examples. Table 3-5, OpenVMS
                 Network Adapter Logicals, lists the OpenVMS logical
                 name that you can use for each transport. You must add
                 the appropriate logicals to SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGICALS.COM
                 to have them available after rebooting.

              2. Restart the server:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$STARTUP

              Table_3-5_OpenVMS_Network_Adapter_Logicals________________

              PWRK$NETBEUI_DEVICE_____________NetBEUI___________________

              The following examples show how to define the appropriate
              network adapter for the DECnet, TCP/IP, and NetBEUI
              transports, respectively:

              o  To specify adapter EWA0: for the DECnet transport,
                 enter the following command:

                 $ DEFINE/SYSTEM NETBIOS$DEVICE EWA0:

              o  To specify adapter ESA0: for the TCP/IP transport,
                 enter the following command:

                 $ DEFINE/SYSTEM PWRK$KNBDAEMON_DEVICE ESA0:

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If TCP/IP is running on multiple network adapters,
                and you select one of those adapters for use by the
                Advanced Server, make sure the adapter you select
                corresponds to the first adapter listed in the
                TCP/IP local hosts database.

                _____________________________________________________

              o  To specify adapter ESA1: for the NetBEUI transport,
                 enter the following command:

                 $ DEFINE/SYSTEM PWRK$NETBEUI_DEVICE ESA1:

              Note that you can specify the same adapter for each
              protocol, as in the following example:

              $ DEFINE/SYSTEM NETBIOS$DEVICE EWA0:
              $ DEFINE/SYSTEM PWRK$KNBDAEMON_DEVICE EWA0:
              $ DEFINE/SYSTEM PWRK$NETBEUI_DEVICE EWA0:

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The names of adapters defined by use of the logical
                names PWRK$NETBEUI_DEVICE, PWRK$KNBDAEMON_DEVICE,
                and NETBIOS$DEVICE must not start with an underscore
                (_); otherwise, the PWRK$KNBDAEMON will not start,
                and other processes will start, but they will not
                operate properly.

                _____________________________________________________

        3.8.2 What to Do If the Network Adapter Is Not Found

              The NETBIOS, PWRK$KNBDAEMON (for TCP/IP), and PWRK$NBDAEMON
              (for NetBEUI) processes require that their associated
              network adapter is known and available to the server
              software. It is possible that new network adapters are
              released that are not known to the current version of the
              Advanced Server software. If the Advanced Server does not
              find or recognize the selected network adapter, each of
              the failing processes (NETBIOS, which is always present,

              and PWRK$KNBDAEMON and PWRK$NBDAEMON, if present) writes
              an error message to its log file. Table 3-6, Undefined
              Adapter Messages, shows each process, the log file that
              records the error message from the process, and examples
              of the text of the error message. In the examples in
              Table 3-6, the server node name is MYNODE. All three error
              messages have the same meaning: that no such device was
              found by the server.

                  Configuring and Starting the Standalone License Server



              The License Server is a software program that you can run
              on an OpenVMS system to grant licenses to clients.

              This chapter describes how to configure and start the
              standalone License Server, and consists of the following
              sections:

              o  Section 4.1, About the License Server

              o  Section 4.2, Before You Begin to Configure the
                 Standalone License Server

              o  Section 4.3, Configuring the Standalone License Server

              o  Section 4.4, Configuring the Transports

              o  Section 4.5, How to Respond to License Server
                 Configuration Prompts

              o  Section 4.6, How to Start the Standalone License Server

        4.1 About the License Server

              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server License Server can provide
              license verification for clients requiring access to
              PATHWORKS (LAN Manager) servers, PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
              (Advanced Server) servers, and Advanced Server for OpenVMS
              servers.

              The License Server is required for client-based licensing.
              If you are using server-based licensing, you do not have
              to run the License Server.

              Each LAN needs only one License Server to support client-
              based licenses. The same License Server can manage
              licenses for client access to any of the following types
              of file and print servers:

              Compaq recommends that you install the License Server on
              a designated OpenVMS system without the Advanced Server.
              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server kit allows you to install
              the standalone License Server separately from the file and

              on an OpenVMS Cluster, where cluster failover provides
              reliability.

              In an OpenVMS Cluster, the PAKs must be loaded into a
              shared license database. For detailed information on
              managing licenses, refer to the Compaq Advanced Server
              for OpenVMS Guide to Managing Advanced Server Licenses.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The License Server included with PATHWORKS Advanced
                Server will not issue or manage PATHWORKS for
                OpenVMS (NetWare) licenses. If you have clients
                using NetWare networking software, maintain
                the existing version of the License Server on
                a different system from the one that is running
                PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

                _____________________________________________________

        4.2 Before You Begin to Configure the Standalone License Server

              You install the standalone License Server from the same
              software kit that you use to install the PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server. The procedures are described in
              Chapter 2, Installing the PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

        4.3 Configuring the Standalone License Server

              You must configure the standalone License Server to
              provide licenses to clients in the LAN. Therefore, you
              select the appropriate transports used by the clients.
              You can configure the License Server to use the following
              transports:

              o  DECnet

              o  NetBEUI

              o  TCP/IP

              Because the License Server supports all these types
              of transports, the startup and shutdown procedures
              have been carefully designed to prevent unexpected
              interruptions in service. You can start and shut down
              the License Server using the file and print server command
              procedures PWRK$STARTUP.COM and PWRK$SHUTDOWN.COM. For
              more information on starting a standalone License Server,
              see Section 4.6, How to Start the Standalone License
              Server.

        4.4 Configuring the Transports

              The following section describes how to use the configura-
              tion command procedure to configure the transports for the
              standalone License Server.

              After the installation procedure completes, the OpenVMS
              system prompt ($) is displayed. If the system was
              rebooted following installation, ensure that you are
              logged in to the SYSTEM account, and do the following:

              1. Start the configuration procedure by entering:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:PWRK$CONFIG

              2. Respond to the configuration prompts.

        4.6 How to Start the Standalone License Server

        4.6 How to Start the Standalone License Server

              You can start the License Server in any of the following
              ways:

              o  During the configuration procedure, as described in
                 Section 4.3, Configuring the Standalone License Server.

              o  Manually from the command line.

              o  Automatically each time you reboot.

        4.6.1 How to Start the License Server Manually

              If you did not start the License Server during the
              configuration procedure, you can start it manually using
              the following command:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$STARTUP <Return>

              The License Server will use DECnet, NetBEUI, TCP/IP.
              Process NETBIOS created with identification 0000011E
              Process PWRK$NBDAEMON created with identification 00000120
              Process PWRK$KNBDAEMON created with identification 00000122
              Process PWRK$LICENSE_S created with identification 00000124
              $

        4.6.2 How to Start the License Server Automatically

              To make sure that the License Server starts automatically
              each time you boot your OpenVMS system:

              1. Edit the system startup file (SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_
                 VMS.COM).

              2. Add the startup command, as shown in the following
                 example. Add the command to the file below all lines
                 that start network transports. The following example
                 shows how to edit the file.

                 $ IF F$SEARCH("SYS$SYSTEM:NETACP.EXE") .NES. ""
                 $ THEN @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET
                 $ ENDIF
                 .
                 .
                 .

        4.6.3 How to Start the License Server in an OpenVMS Cluster

              If you installed and configured the License Server on
              multiple members of the same OpenVMS Cluster, Compaq
              suggests that you use the SYSMAN utility to start the
              License Server manually and simultaneously on all cluster
              members. To do so:

              1. Make sure that you are logged in to the SYSTEM account
                 on one of the server nodes in the OpenVMS Cluster.

              2. Start the SYSMAN utility by entering:

                 $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSMAN

              3. Define all the cluster members on which you want to
                 start the standalone License Server. For example, if
                 you want to start the License Server on nodes HYDRAA,
                 HYDRAB, and HYDRAC:

                 SYSMAN> SET ENVIRONMENT/NODE=(HYDRAA,HYDRAB,HYDRAC)

              4. Start the License Server on the nodes you defined. At
                 the SYSMAN> prompt, enter the following command:

                 SYSMAN> DO @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$STARTUP

              Only one License Server in the cluster will be active at a
              time. If that License Server becomes unavailable, cluster
              failover activates one of the other License Servers to
              take over.

        5.3 Starting the PATHWORKS Advanced Server

              The following sections describe what the startup procedure
              does, when and how to start the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
              (manually or automatically), and and how to troubleshoot
              problems with startup.

              You can start the Advanced Server:

              o  During the configuration procedure, as described in
                 Chapter 3, Configuring the PATHWORKS Advanced Server

              o  Manually from the command line

              o  Automatically each time you reboot

        5.3.1 When to Start the PATHWORKS Advanced Server

              You must configure the server before you can start it for
              the first time. After running the configuration procedure,
              you can start and stop the server at any time.

        5.3.2 What the Startup Procedure Does

              The startup procedure:

              1. Checks for the required privileges.

              2. Verifies that required configuration files are
                 available.

              3. Verifies that the server has been configured, and exits
                 if it was not.

              4. If a reboot is required, verifies that it was
                 performed, and exits if it was not.

              5. Loads transport drivers.

              6. Installs images.

              7. Starts transport support processes.

              8. Starts each of the components:

                 o  License Registrar

                 o  License Server (if configured)

                 o  File and print server

        5.3.3 How to Start the PATHWORKS Advanced Server Manually

              If you did not start the PATHWORKS Advanced Server during
              the configuration procedure, you can start it now by
              entering:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$STARTUP

              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server starts, and messages similar
              to the following are displayed:

              PATHWORKS file server will use DECnet, TCP/IP.
              PATHWORKS mail notification will use DECnet.
              Process NETBIOS created with identification 0000009A
              Process PWRK$LICENSE_R created with identification 0000009D
              The PATHWORKS V6.1 server is configured to support 20 PC clients.
              Process PWRK$MASTER created with identification 000000A2
              The master process will now start all other PATHWORKS processes.

        5.3.4 How to Start the PATHWORKS Advanced Server Automatically

              To make sure that the server starts automatically each
              time you boot your OpenVMS system:

              1. Edit the system startup file, SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.

              2. Add the @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$STARTUP command to the file
                 below all lines that start network transports. For
                 example:

                 $ START/NETWORK DECNET
                 .
                 .
                 .

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$STARTUP

        5.3.5 How to Start the PATHWORKS Advanced Server in an OpenVMS
              Cluster

              Before starting the server in an OpenVMS Cluster, the
              server software must be installed and configured on each
              cluster member on which the server is to run. If you
              installed and configured the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
              on multiple members of the same OpenVMS Cluster, Compaq
              recommends that you use the SYSMAN utility to start the
              server manually and simultaneously on all cluster members.

        5.3 Starting the PATHWORKS Advanced Server

              To start the server on all cluster members at the same
              time, make sure you are logged in to the SYSTEM account
              on one of the server nodes, then run SYSMAN as indicated
              in the second column of Table 5-3, Starting the Server in
              an OpenVMS Cluster, according to the result you want to
              achieve, as listed in the first column.

                If you are using the STARTUP feature of the SYSMAN
                utility to start Advanced Server, you must pass a P1
                parameter of " " (null or space). For example:

                SYSMAN> STARTUP ADD FILE PWRK$STARTUP.COM/PARAMETER=P1:" "

                For more information on using the SYSMAN utility's
                STARTUP feature, refer to the OpenVMS System
                Management Utilities Reference Manual.

                              5.3 Starting the PATHWORKS Advanced Server

        5.3.6 Troubleshooting the Startup

              PATHWORKS Advanced Server processes are detached
              processes. During startup, all detached processes must
              execute the site-specific system login procedure (by
              default, SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM).

              If the PATHWORKS Advanced Server startup does not complete
              successfully, check the SYLOGIN.COM procedure. Make sure
              that only commands that should be executed by detached
              processes are executed during the PATHWORKS Advanced
              Server startup.

              In SYLOGIN.COM, you can use the DCL lexical function
              F$MODE or F$GETJPI to conditionalize DCL commands, such
              as $SET TERM/INQUIRE, that should be executed only by
              nondetached processes, so that they are not executed
              during the PATHWORKS Advanced Server startup. Refer to
              the OpenVMS DCL Dictionary for more information.

        5.4 Stopping the PATHWORKS Advanced Server

              The following sections describe when and how to stop the
              PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

        5.4.1 When to Stop the PATHWORKS Advanced Server

              You can stop the server at any time for any reason, which
              can include the following:

              o  When you want to change server parameters

              o  As part of an orderly system shutdown

              o  As needed to troubleshoot server problems

        5.4.2 How to Stop the PATHWORKS Advanced Server

              To stop the server, enter the following command:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$SHUTDOWN

              For a cluster server, enter:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$SHUTDOWN CLUSTER

              Before shutting down the OpenVMS operating system, Compaq
              recommends stopping the server.

        5.4.3 How to Stop the PATHWORKS Advanced Server on System
              Shutdown

              To stop the server as part of an orderly system shutdown,
              add the shutdown command to the site-specific system
              shutdown procedure. In addition, prior to shutting down
              the server, announce the planned shutdown to connected
              users by using the ADMINISTER SEND/USERS command, as in
              the following example, which alerts all users connected to
              server WOODMAN:

              LANDOFOZ\\TINMAN> SEND/USERS/SERVER=WOODMAN-
              _LANDOFOZ\\TINAMAN> "Shutdown @ 1pm today!!!"

        5.5 How to Define PATHWORKS Advanced Server Commands When You
            Log In

              Compaq provides numerous command procedures that, for
              example, provide shortcuts for invoking certain server
              management commands and procedures. You can see a list
              of these commands by examining the contents of the file
              SYS$MANAGER:PWRK$DEFINE_COMMANDS.COM.

              You can define these Advanced Server management commands
              automatically when you log in to the account that you
              use to manage the Advanced Server. To define Advanced
              Server commands at login, edit the LOGIN.COM file of the
              privileged account to add the following line:

              $ @SYS$MANAGER:PWRK$DEFINE_COMMANDS

        5.6 Setting Up External Authentication

              The OpenVMS operating system Versions 7.1 and higher
              provide support for external authentication. PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server participates with the OpenVMS operating
              system to allow PATHWORKS Advanced Server domain users
              to log in to the OpenVMS operating system using their
              PATHWORKS Advanced Server domain user names and passwords.
              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server externally authenticates the
              login request.

                         After You Install the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
                                  5.6 Setting Up External Authentication

              External authentication can provide automatic password
              synchronization between an OpenVMS account and a
              corresponding Advanced Server domain account. Users
              who have both OpenVMS and PATHWORKS Advanced Server
              domain user accounts can avoid maintaining two different
              passwords. If the domain account password is changed, the
              OpenVMS LOGINOUT program sets the OpenVMS account password
              to the domain account password the next time the user logs
              in to the OpenVMS account. If the user changes the OpenVMS
              password with the DCL SET PASSWORD command, the the SET
              PASSWORD command sends the password change to the Advanced
              Server external authenticator. For synchronization to
              succeed, an Advanced Server domain controller must be
              available and the domain account password must meet
              OpenVMS syntax requirements.

              When you start the Advanced Server, external authenti-
              cation is automatically enabled for user accounts that
              are flagged for external authentication in the SYSUAF.
              (To enable external authentication, PWRK$ACME_STARTUP.COM
              defines bit 0 of the SYS$SINGLE_SIGNON logical to the
              value 1. You can disable external authentication by
              changing the default value of this bit. For information
              on disabling external authentication and about defining
              the other bits in the SYS$SINGLE_SIGNON logical, see
              Section 5.6.5, Disabling External Authentication.)

              For more information about enabling external authenti-
              cation on OpenVMS, refer to the OpenVMS Guide to System
              Security.

              No additional configuration is necessary on cluster
              members running the Advanced Server to enable the Advanced
              Server to participate in the external authentication
              process. However, to use external authentication in
              an Advanced Server cluster, all cluster members should
              be configured to use external authentication, so that
              externally authenticated users can log on to the cluster
              through any node in the cluster. A cluster member that is
              not running the complete Advanced Server can be configured
              to authenticate logon requests from network users if
              it has access to external authentication software on a
              shared cluster system disk. If it does not have access
              to external authentication software on a shared cluster

        After You Install the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
        5.6 Setting Up External Authentication

              system disk, you can enable external authentication on
              that system by copying only the external authentication
              images to the system disk, following the steps given
              in Section 5.6.1, Setting Up External Authentication in
              OpenVMS Clusters.

              To provide external authentication on the system, perform
              the following steps:

              1. Install one of the following:

                 o  The PATHWORKS Advanced Server

                 o  The standalone PATHWORKS external authentication
                    software

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                At least one node in the cluster must run the
                complete Advanced Server software.

                _____________________________________________________

                 For more information, see Chapter 2, Installing the
                 PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

              2. Set the appropriate OpenVMS user accounts to allow
                 external authentication (in SYSUAF). For more
                 information, refer to the OpenVMS Guide to System
                 Security.

              3. If the PATHWORKS Advanced Server is installed, start
                 the server and external authentication will be enabled
                 for all user accounts allowing external authentication.

                 If the standalone PATHWORKS external authentication
                 software is installed, perform the following:

                 a. Add the following lines to your SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM
                    file:

                    $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXE SYS$SINGLE_SIGNON 1
                    $ @SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$ACME_STARTUP.COM

                    In a cluster, add these preceding two lines plus
                    the following in a node-specific system startup
                    file (not clusterwide), or if using a shared system
                    startup file such as SYS$COMMON:[SYSMGR]SYLOGICALS.COM,
                    ensure that you conditionalize the DEFINE command

                    based on the node name (that is, using the lexical
                    function F$GETSYI).

        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXE PWRK$ACME_SERVER scsnode1_name[,scsnode2_name,...]

                    Each scsnodex_name is an equivalence name, which
                    is the SCSNODE name of a cluster member running
                    an Advanced Server that can be used to process
                    external authentication requests. You can include
                    all, or a subset of, the names of the Advanced
                    Server member nodes. This allows you to specify
                    the order in which the requesting host contacts the
                    hosts running the complete Advanced Server software
                    for an authentication request. If the first node in
                    the list does not respond, the requesting host asks
                    the next host, and so forth.

                 For more information, refer to the OpenVMS Guide to
                 System Security and Section 5.6.1.

              4. Establish host mapping between PATHWORKS Advanced
                 Server domain user accounts and the corresponding
                 OpenVMS user accounts, if necessary. For more
                 information, refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
                 (Advanced Server) Server Administrator's Guide.

              5. If your Advanced Server is participating in an OpenVMS
                 Cluster, set up external authentication on all cluster
                 members. For more information, see Section 5.6.1,
                 Setting Up External Authentication in OpenVMS Clusters.

              6. If you want to change the default domain used for
                 external authentication, set the system logical
                 PWRK$ACME_DEFAULT_DOMAIN accordingly. (The local
                 server's domain is the default domain for users when
                 external authentication is established: if a user
                 does not specify a domain name at login, the system
                 uses the default domain for authentication.) For more
                 information, refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
                 (Advanced Server) Server Administrator's Guide.

              7. If establishing external authentication for users in
                 trusted domains, add the name of the trusted domain(s)
                 to the LANMAN.INI parameter HostMapDomains. For more
                 information, refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
                 (Advanced Server) Server Administrator's Guide.

              Guide (included in the OpenVMS Documentation CD-ROM).

        5.6.1 Setting Up External Authentication in OpenVMS Clusters

              If you are running PATHWORKS Advanced Server in an OpenVMS
              Cluster, Compaq recommends that all cluster members be
              configured to be able to process OpenVMS logon requests
              for network users.

              As noted in the preceding section, when the Advanced
              Server is started on a system, external authentication
              is enabled automatically for user accounts flagged for
              external authentication in the SYSUAF. A cluster member
              that is not running the complete Advanced Server can
              authenticate logon requests from network users if it has
              access to external authentication software on a shared
              cluster disk. Note that external authentication is not
              supported on OpenVMS systems prior to V7.1. Therefore, to
              ensure that external authentication works properly on the
              cluster, Compaq recommends that you make sure all systems
              in the cluster are running OpenVMS V7.1 or later.

              If the cluster member does not have access to external
              authentication software on a shared cluster disk, you can
              enable external authentication on that system by copying
              just the external authentication images onto that system.

              If the cluster member has a shared system disk, skip step
              1 below and perform the remaining steps. If the cluster
              member does not have a shared system disk, perform all
              steps.

              1. If the member node that is not running the PATHWORKS
                 Advanced Server is running OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.2-
                 1 or later or OpenVMS VAX V7.2 or later, install
                 the standalone PATHWORKS external authentication
                 software on that member node from the PATHWORKS for
                 OpenVMS (Advanced Server) software kit, as described in
                 Chapter 2, Installing the PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

                                  5.6 Setting Up External Authentication

                 If the member node that is not running the PATHWORKS
                 Advanced Server is running OpenVMS VAX Version 7.1,
                 copy the following external authentication files from
                 any system disk where the complete PATHWORKS Advanced
                 Server is installed to the location indicated on the
                 VAX node:

        SYS$LIBRARY:PWRK$ACME_MODULE_VAX.EXE to SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]

        SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$ACME_STARTUP.COM to SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]

                 If the member node that is not running the PATHWORKS
                 Advanced Server is running OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1,
                 then copy the following external authentication files
                 from any system disk where the complete PATHWORKS
                 Advanced Server is installed to the location indicated
                 on the Alpha node:

        SYS$LIBRARY:PWRK$ACME_MODULE_ALPHA.EXE to SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]

        SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$ACME_STARTUP.COM to SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]

              2. Add the following lines in a node-specific system
                 startup file (not clusterwide), or if using a shared
                 system startup file such as
                 SYS$COMMON:[SYSMGR]SYLOGICALS.COM, ensure that you
                 conditionalize the DEFINE command based on the node
                 name (that is, using the lexical function F$GETSYI).

        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXE SYS$SINGLE_SIGNON 1
        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXE PWRK$ACME_SERVER scsnode1_name[,scsnode2_name,...]
        $ @SYS$STARTUP:ACME_STARTUP.COM

                 In the second line, each scsnodex_name is an equiv-
                 alence name, which is the SCSNODE name of a cluster
                 member running an Advanced Server that can be used
                 to process external authentication requests. You can
                 include all, or a subset of, the names of the Advanced
                 Server member nodes. This allows you to specify the
                 order in which the requesting host contacts the hosts
                 running the complete Advanced Server software for an
                 authentication request. If the first node in the list
                 does not respond, the requesting host asks the next
                 host, and so forth.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If you specify a subset of the Advanced Server
                member nodes, in order for external authentication
                requests to be processed properly, the Advanced
                Server should be running (available) on at least one
                of those specified cluster members. Otherwise, even
                if another Advanced Server member node not specified
                in the list is currently running, the requests will
                not be processed.

                _____________________________________________________

              3. Invoke the SYS$STARTUP:PWRK$ACME_STARTUP command
                 procedure during system startup.

              4. Set appropriate OpenVMS user accounts on all cluster
                 members to allow external authentication, and if
                 necessary, set up host mapping between the OpenVMS user
                 accounts and the Advanced Server user accounts. For
                 more information about enabling OpenVMS user accounts
                 for external authentication, refer to the OpenVMS Guide
                 to System Security. For more information about setting
                 up host mapping, refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for
                 OpenVMS (Advanced Server) Server Administrator's Guide.
                 (For OpenVMS V7.1 systems, refer to the OpenVMS V7.1
                 New Featuers Manual.)

        5.6.2 Requirement for External Authentication Over DECnet-Plus

              To allow users to be externally authenticated over
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS, set the OpenVMS system parameter
              NET_CALLOUTS to 255. This enables Advanced Server user ID
              mapping and authentication for network logins.

        5.6.3 Configuring the Server Capacity for External
              Authentication

              By default, the Advanced Server can support up to 10
              simultaneous external authentication logon requests
              (signons). You can modify this maximum to suit the
              Advanced Server requirements, using the Configuration
              Manager. To start the Configuration Manager, enter the
              following command:

              $ ADMINISTER/CONFIGURATION

                                  5.6 Setting Up External Authentication

              The basic server parameters include the number of
              simultaneous activations for users with external
              authentication.

              For more information about using the Configuration
              Manager, refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
              (Advanced Server) Server Administrator's Guide.

        5.6.4 Bypassing External Authentication When the Network Is
              Down

              External authentication cannot occur if a network
              connection is required and the network is down. However,
              as a temporary solution, privileged users can enter the
              /LOCAL_PASSWORD qualifier after the OpenVMS user name at
              the login prompt, to specify local authentication. Be sure
              to specify the OpenVMS user name and password when using
              the /LOCAL_PASSWORD qualifier.

              Because using the /LOCAL_PASSWORD qualifier effectively
              overrides the security policy established by the system
              manager, it is allowed only when the user's account has
              SYSPRV as an authorized privilege. This allows the system
              manager to gain access to the system when the network is
              down. When Bit 1 of the equivalence string is set in the
              SYS$SINGLE_SIGNON logical name, nonprivileged users who
              are normally externally authenticated can log in locally
              (the /LOCAL_PASSWORD qualifier need not be specified).

              For more information about the /LOCAL_PASSWORD qualifier
              for the login command line, refer to the OpenVMS Guide
              to System Security. (For OpenVMS Version 7.1 systems,
              refer to the OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference
              Manual in the OpenVMS Version 7.1 documentation.

        5.6.5 Disabling External Authentication

              If you want to disable external authentication, then be-
              fore starting the Advanced Server, define the SYS$SINGLE_
              SIGNON logical to a value of 0, as in the following
              example:

              $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXECUTIVE SYS$SINGLE_SIGNON 0

              For more information about SYS$SINGLE_SIGNON and disabling
              external authentication on OpenVMS, refer to the OpenVMS
              Guide to System Security.

        5.7 Installing Optional Server Administration Tools

              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server provides optional client-
              based server administration tools that allow you to
              manage the server from Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
              for Workgroups, or Windows NT clients. These tools
              are available in the PWUTIL share after installing,
              configuring and starting the server.

              The SRVTOOLS directory in the PWUTIL share contains a
              subdirectory for each type of client computer. Refer to
              the README.TXT file in the appropriate subdirectory for

                                        Implementing a Wide Area Network



              This chapter describes how to set up a wide area network
              (WAN) using one of the TCP/IP transport software products
              supported by PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

              This chapter consists of the following sections:

              o  Section 6.1, Enabling Wide Area Networking

              o  Section 6.2, Using the LMHOSTS File for Wide Area
                 Networking

              o  Section 6.3, Using WINS in a Wide Area Network

              o  Section 6.4, Using DNS in a Wide Area Network

        6.1 Enabling Wide Area Networking

              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server allows you to use one or
              more of the following methods for wide area network name
              resolution:

              o  LMHOSTS file for TCP/IP

              o  Windows Internet Name Servers (WINS)

              o  Domain Name System (DNS)

              To use them, they must be enabled using the Configuration
              Manager. You can enable them through the PWRK$CONFIG.COM
              command procedure, which provides access to the Configuration
              Manager when you answer YES to the question "Do you want
              to change server configuration parameters." To enable one
              or more of the wide area networking methods, select the
              Transports screen and select the appropriate checkbox.
              Alternatively, you can run the Configuration Manager after
              the server is configured and started, as described in
              the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) Server
              Administrator's Guide.

        6.2 Using the LMHOSTS File for Wide Area Networking

              The PATHWORKS Advanced Server software provides the
              ability to set up a wide area network with the TCP/IP
              transport through the use of the LMHOSTS file. This
              file contains a list of domain controllers and member
              servers in the same domain and also domain controllers in
              domains that have trusts established with that domain. The
              LMHOSTS file allows the Advanced Server to participate in
              a Windows NT wide area network as well.

              Unlike a Windows NT Server, the Advanced Server does not
              support remote LMHOSTS files (called into the Windows NT
              LMHOSTS file using #INCLUDE). To include the same host
              names as an existing LMHOSTS file on a Windows NT Server,
              copy the LMHOSTS file to the Advanced Server then manually
              insert the entries into the Advanced Server LMHOSTS file.

                ______________________ Caution ______________________

                If you plan to use cluster load balancing in WANs
                (using DNS for NetBIOS resolution of the Advanced
                Server cluster alias name), you must remove all
                entries for the cluster alias from the LMHOSTS
                file on all systems that will access the Advanced
                Server cluster and that have enabled DNS for name
                resolution. For more information on cluster load
                balancing, refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
                (Advanced Server) Server Administrator's Guide.

                _____________________________________________________

        6.2.1 Setting up a TCP/IP Wide Area Network

              To set up a TCP/IP wide area network, modify the LMHOSTS
              file, adding the host names and TCP/IP addresses of the
              domain controllers and member servers in the wide area
              network that are in the same domain or in domains that
              have trust relationships with that domain.

              The LMHOSTS file must be set up on all domain controllers
              and member servers in the domain, unless other methods are
              used to resolve NetBIOS names. Make sure your Advanced
              Server LMHOSTS file includes entries for all domain
              controllers and member servers of the domain and domain

              controllers in domains that have trusts established with
              that domain.

              Note the following when configuring a server that will
              be a backup domain controller (BDC) or member server in
              an existing domain: if the LMHOSTS file does not include
              entries for a primary domain controller (PDC) that is in a
              different TCP/IP subnet, your server will not be able to
              find that PDC. Make sure you include entries for that PDC
              in the LMHOSTS file before running PWRK$CONFIG to join the
              existing domain. Two entries are required for a PDC:

              o  One standard entry for the computer name of the PDC

              o  One entry that uniquely identifies the system as the
                 PDC of the domain. This entry contains the domain
                 name (space padded to 15 characters) with a 16th-
                 byte control character of \0x1B. See the example in
                 Section 6.2.3, LMHOSTS File Syntax.

              BDCs periodically retrieve changes to the domain-wide
              security accounts database from the PDC. If you omit a
              BDC from the LMHOSTS file on the PDC, the PDC will not
              notify the BDC that database changes need to be retrieved.
              Or, if a BDC omits the necessary entries for the PDC,
              the BDC will be unable to locate the PDC when attempting
              to retrieve database changes. In either case, the BDC's
              database will become out of date.

              You can modify the LMHOSTS file at any time. As long
              as the LMHOSTS file exists, users can establish TCP/IP
              connections to any server listed in the file.

        6.2.2 The LMHOSTS Directory

              You set up a wide area network by supplying the following
              file on all OpenVMS file and print servers that are in
              different subnets:

              PWRK$LMROOT:[LANMAN]LMHOSTS.

              The LMHOSTS file has no file extension; include the final
              dot, as shown.

        Implementing a Wide Area Network
        6.2 Using the LMHOSTS File for Wide Area Networking

        6.2.3 LMHOSTS File Syntax

              In the LMHOSTS file, create a list of nodes by specifying
              the following line for each node:

              address NetBIOSname #PRE #DOM:domain_name

              Where:

              o  address is an Internet address of form x.x.x.x, where x
                 is a decimal number from 0 to 255.

              o  NetBIOSname is a name from 1 to 16 characters long,
                 and may include a control character. (The format of
                 a control character is \0Xnn or \nn, where n is a
                 hexadecimal digit.)

                 To include a nonprinting or control character, enclose
                 the name in double quotation marks. All alphabetic
                 characters are set to uppercase characters before the
                 name is loaded into cache (see the #PRE directive,
                 below) or used for matching.

                 If you wish to include the 16th-byte control character
                 in the name explicitly, you must

                 o  Pad the name with spaces to control the placement of
                    the control character.

                 o  Enclose the name and control character within double
                    quotes.

                 The following are some valid NetBIOS names:

                 speedy
                 "LANDOFOZ       \0x1B"

              o  #PRE is an optional directive that indicates that the
                 entry should be preloaded into the cache. Entries that
                 have the #PRE tag are preloaded into the cache when
                 the Advanced Server first starts up. If you add a #PRE-
                 tagged entry to the LMHOSTS file after the Advanced
                 Server starts up, the name will not be preloaded into
                 the cache until the Advanced Server is restarted.
                 However, the name will be available at the next lookup
                 of the LMHOSTS file.

                     6.2 Using the LMHOSTS File for Wide Area Networking

              o  #DOM:domain-name designates the entry as a domain
                 controller in the domain specified by domain-name. It
                 is required when the entry is a domain controller. It
                 should not be included on entries for member servers.

                 The #DOM:domain-name directive affects how the logon
                 and browser services behave in routed environments. It
                 is also used in user account management and in trust
                 relationships.

              For example, the following entries should be included
              in the LMHOSTS file on a BDC that is not in the same IP
              subnet as the PDC (if the two systems are in the same IP
              subnet, they can resolve names using broadcasts). In this
              example, the PDC name is DOMPDC at IP address 10.20.30.40
              in the domain LANGROUP:

              10.20.30.40  DOMPDC  #PRE  #DOM:LANGROUP
              10.20.30.40 "LANGROUP       \0x1B"  #PRE

              The \0x1B name will be registered only by the PDC for the
              domain. If a BDC is promoted to PDC, the original PDC will
              release the \0x1B name, allowing the new PDC to register
              it; LMHOSTS files on other systems that contain an entry
              for this \0x1B name must be updated to reflect the IP
              address of the new PDC.

              If the domain PDC is a PATHWORKS or Advanced Server for
              OpenVMS server running on multiple members of an OpenVMS
              Cluster, only one cluster member will register the \0x1B
              name (the first to start the NetLogon service). However,
              if the server stops on that cluster member, the \0x1B
              name will be released by that cluster member and will
              then be registered by another cluster member running the
              server. In this scenario, LMHOSTS files on other systems
              that contain an entry for this \0x1B name must be updated
              to reflect the IP address of the cluster member that has
              registered, and now holds, the \0x1B name. To determine
              the cluster member that has registered and currently holds
              the \0x1B name, execute the NBSHOW KNB command at the
              OpenVMS DCL prompt on each node of the cluster and look
              for the \0x1B name in the name table that is displayed.
              The \0x1B name will show up in the name table of only one
              of the cluster members. The command NBSHOW is a special

              command file SYS$MANAGER:PWRK$DEFINE_COMMANDS.COM; for
              more information, see Section 5.5, How to Define PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server Commands When You Log In.

                ______________________ Caution ______________________

                If LMHOSTS files are not updated on all systems
                to reflect a PDC change, these systems might not
                be able to find the PDC for the domain. This would
                affect domain operations adversely.

                _____________________________________________________

              In environments using trust relationships, the domain
              controllers in trusting domains must establish a secure
              communications channel with a domain controller in the
              trusted domain. This allows a user with an account in
              the trusted domain to access resources provided by a
              domain that trusts the user's domain (called pass-through
              authentication). Therefore, domain controllers in the
              trusting domain, as well as those in the trusted domain,
              should list all domain controllers from the other domain
              in their respective LMHOSTS file. (This assumes other
              NetBIOS name resolution methods, such as WINS, are not
              being used.) Each domain controller should also include
              a \0x1B entry for the PDC of the other domain. In the
              following example, the domain LANGROUP trusts the domain
              CORPDOM. The LANGROUP domain consists of the following
              domain controllers:

              __________________________________________________________
              Name____IP_Address____Role________________________________

              LGPPDC  192.20.30.40  PDC

              LGPBDC__192.20.30.41__BDC_________________________________

              The CORPDOM domain consists of the following domain
              controllers:

              __________________________________________________________

              CORPBDC2____110.10.1.1____BDC_____________________________

              To enable the domain controllers in domain LANGROUP to
              locate a domain controller in domain CORPDOM, include the
              following entries in the LMHOSTS file located on domain
              controllers in domain LANGROUP:

              110.5.5.5   CORPPDC #PRE    #DOM:CORPDOM
              110.5.5.5  "CORPDOM        \0x1B"  #PRE
              110.5.5.20  CORPBDC1 #PRE    #DOM:CORPDOM
              110.10.1.1  CORPBDC2   #PRE    #DOM:CORPDOM

              Similarly, to enable the domain controllers in domain
              CORPDOM to locate the domain controllers in domain
              LANGROUP, include the following entries in the LMHOSTS
              file located on the domain controllers in domain CORPDOM:

              192.20.30.40 LGPPDC  #PRE  #DOM:LANGROUP
              192.20.30.40 "LANGROUP       \0x1B"  #PRE
              192.20.30.41 LGPBDC  #PRE  #DOM:LANGROUP

              The #DOM directive is required in these cases. It
              explicitly designates the system as a domain controller
              in the specified domain. Note that if you include member
              servers in the LMHOSTS file (whether they be Windows NT or
              Advanced Server member servers), you should omit the #DOM
              directive. Member servers are not domain controllers.

        6.2.4 Managing the LMHOSTS File

              To change the list of available nodes, you can edit the
              file at any time. Domain controller entries (specified by
              the #DOM directive) and computer name entries without the
              #PRE directive are resolved by checking the LMHOSTS file
              dynamically. This check occurs whenever a name needs to be
              resolved and is not found in the name cache.

              To disable LMHOSTS name resolution, rename all versions
              of the LMHOSTS file to any name other than LMHOSTS. Or,
              you can use the Configuration Manager to disable LMHOSTS
              name resolution. Start the Configuration Manager ($
              ADMIN/CONFIG), select the Transports option, and clear
              the check mark next to the Enable LMHOSTS Resolution

                                    Implementing a Wide Area Network 6-7

 



        Implementing a Wide Area Network
        6.2 Using the LMHOSTS File for Wide Area Networking

              option. When you use the Configuration Manager to enable
              or disable LMHOSTS name resolution, the change is not
              dynamic; that is, the change will not go into effect until
              the next time the Advanced Server is started.

              When you add an entry to the LMHOSTS file while the
              Advanced Server is running, if the entry includes the
              #PRE directive, the entry will not be cached permanently
              (as directed by the #PRE part of the entry) until the next
              restart of the server; however, the change is effective
              immedately, as it will be read dynamically when the name
              next needs to be resolved.

        6.2.5 Using the LMHOSTS Log File

              If errors occur when the LMHOSTS file is accessed, the
              errors are recorded in the following file:

              PWRK$LMROOT:[LOGS]PWRK$KNBDAEMON_nodename.LOG

              This file is open and being written to while the PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server is running. To close the log file, you
              must stop the PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

              To prevent the log file from becoming too large, each
              error is logged only once - the first time it occurs.
              If an error is found in the log file, it is not logged
              again.

        6.3 Using WINS in a Wide Area Network

              You can configure the PATHWORKS Advanced Server as a WINS
              client. This allows the Advanced Server to use a WINS
              Server for NetBIOS name registration, resolution, renewal,
              and release in a wide area network configuration.

              For more information on how to use the Configuration
              Manager to configure the Advanced Server to use WINS,
              refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced
              Server) Server Administrator's Guide.

                                   6.3 Using WINS in a Wide Area Network

        6.3.1 Setting up WINS Support for OpenVMS Clusters

              To allow clients that are configured for WINS support
              to use an Advanced Server alias name to connect to a
              clustered Advanced Server across a WAN, you must add
              to the WINS database a static multihomed entry for the
              Advanced Server alias name.

              When adding the static multihomed entry for the Advanced
              Server alias name, you should enter the TCP/IP address
              of each node in the OpenVMS Cluster that is running the
              Advanced Server.

              For more information about adding static entries to the
              WINS database, refer to your WINS product documentation.

                ______________________ Caution ______________________

                If you plan to use DNS name resolution to provide
                cluster load balancing in WANs, you might need to
                remove all static entries for the cluster alias from
                the WINS database. (If Windows 95, Windows 98, or
                Windows NT clients are configured to use both WINS
                and DNS for NetBIOS name resolution, they first
                query the WINS server to resolve the name.) For more
                information about enabling cluster load balancing
                in WANs, refer to the Compaq PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
                (Advanced Server) Server Administrator's Guide.

                _____________________________________________________

        6.4 Using DNS in a Wide Area Network

              You can configure the Advanced Server as a DNS client.
              This allows the Advanced Server to use a DNS server for
              NetBIOS name resolution. The Advanced Server uses DNS for
              name resolution as a last resort if all other methods fail
              to resolve a NetBIOS name.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                DNS name resolution is not provided as a replacement
                for WINS and/or LMHOSTS but rather as a supplement
                to them. With DNS, the Advanced Server still uses

                             Removing PATHWORKS Advanced Server Software



              This chapter describes how to remove the PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server software from your system.

              This chapter consists of the following sections:

              o  Section 7.1, PATHWORKS Advanced Server Deinstallation
                 Command Procedure

              o  Section 7.2, Removing the PATHWORKS NetWare Server

              You may need to remove server software for one of the
              following reasons:

              o  If the installation failed

                 If the IVP indicates that the software installation
                 procedure failed, you must reinstall the PATHWORKS
                 Advanced Server software.

                 If your system has enough free disk space, you can
                 install the server again without deinstalling the
                 PATHWORKS Advanced Server. However, if you do not have
                 enough disk space, you must remove PATHWORKS Advanced
                 Server before reinstalling it.

                 For more information about disk space requirements, see
                 Section 1.9.9, Step 9: Check Disk Space Requirements.

              o  If you are upgrading

                 If the system is running the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
                 (NetWare) server, the NetWare server software must
                 be removed before you can install PATHWORKS Advanced
                 Server. If the NetWare server is installed when you run
                 the PATHWORKS Advanced Server installation procedure,
                 it gives you the option of removing the NetWare server
                 software (Section 2.3.2, Installing the PATHWORKS
                 Advanced Server on a System with the NetWare Server).
                 Alternatively, you can manually remove the NetWare

                 server using the procedure described in Section 7.2,
                 Removing the PATHWORKS NetWare Server.


        7.1 PATHWORKS Advanced Server Deinstallation Command Procedure

              You remove the PATHWORKS Advanced Server using a command
              procedure that is included when you install PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server. The deinstallation command procedure
              performs the following operations:

              o  Shuts down the server automatically.

              o  Prompts you to enter information necessary to complete
                 the deinstallation procedure.

              o  Removes all PATHWORKS Advanced Server images, support
                 files, and logical names that are created during the
                 installation procedure.

              o  Prompts you whether to remove all Advanced Server data
                 files from the system.

              o  Removes the PATHWORKS Advanced Server accounts if you
                 delete the data files.

              o  If an an older PATHWORKS server (such as PATHWORKS
                 for OpenVMS (Macintosh) or PATHWORKS V4) is detected,
                 prompts you whether you want to delete the NETBIOS
                 image SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]NETBIOS.EXE. Normally, you
                 should not delete the NETBIOS image. You might want
                 to delete it if you are installing an older kit, for
                 example. Depending on your response to this prompt,
                 the procedure saves or deletes several other related
                 files. If you delete the NETBIOS image, the PATHWORKS
                 mail server and DOS File Maintenance utility will not
                 operate.

                 Saved files include files that might be needed later,
                 such as:

                 -  PWRK$DELETEACE.EXE and PWRK$FIXACE.EXE, both of
                    which can be used to optimize disk storage - the
                    former by removing unwanted ACEs, the latter by
                    compressing ACEs, removing unnecessary ACEs, and
                    preventing ACEs from being propagated to files
                    created in shares. For more information, refer to

              To start the deinstallation procedure and remove PATHWORKS
              Advanced Server software:

              1. Ensure that you are logged in to the SYSTEM account.

              2. Ensure that no processes are running the Advanced
                 Server ADMINISTER command-line interface.

        o If you are installing the server for the first time, the default is
          the first unused UIC group number, starting with 360.

        o If there is an existing account PCFS$ACCOUNT, the default is the UIC
          group number associated with PCFS$ACCOUNT.

        o If there is an existing account PWRK$DEFAULT or PWRK$GUEST, the
          default is the UIC group number associated with PWRK$DEFAULT or
          PWRK$GUEST, in preference to PCFS$ACCOUNT.  However, the default
          UIC group number will
          not be used to change the UIC of any existing accounts.

            For more information about UIC group numbers, see the OpenVMS System
            Manager's Manual.

          PATHWORKS stores and accesses the following types of data files:

          o Configuration parameter files
          o License Server data files
          o Log files
          o Printer spool files
          o Virtual memory section files

          You can specify any existing OpenVMS disk device that has at least
          5000 free blocks of disk space to store these data files.

          Note: the server frequently accesses the data files stored on the
          disk.  If these files are stored on the system disk, it can degrade
          the performance of both the OpenVMS system and the server. Therefore,
          Compaq recommends that you specify a disk other than the system disk.

        Press RETURN to continue: <Return>

         If this OpenVMS Cluster has multiple system disks, make sure that all
         nodes on which you plan to run PATHWORKS:

         o Use the same disk device to store and access PATHWORKS data files.

        configure it to use all the transports used by any of the backup servers
        in the domain.

        If you want this server to be a backup domain controller, you should
        configure it to have at least one transport in common with the domain's
        primary domain controller, otherwise this configuration will fail.

                                            Upgrade Utility Installation



              This appendix shows a sample installation of the Upgrade
              utility.

        D.1 Installing the Upgrade Utility

              As a first step in upgrading a system that is running a
              previously released version of PATHWORKS Advanced Server,
              you can install the Upgrade utility without installing the
              server. Doing this allows you to run the PATHWORKS (LAN
              Manager) server while performing the upgrade procedure,
              avoiding any interruption of services to your users.

              If you install the Upgrade utility only, the on-disk
              structure and datafile format are not changed, and the
              PATHWORKS (LAN Manager) executables are not replaced.

              When you execute the installation procedure on a system
              that is running PATHWORKS (LAN Manager), the procedure
              offers you the option of installing the Upgrade utility
              only. To install the Upgrade utility only, select this
              option.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                When you install the Upgrade utility only, you
                cannot run the Installation Verification Procedure
                (IVP); therefore, the prompt asking whether you
                want to run the IVP is not displayed during the
                installation.

            You have the option to install only the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
            Advanced Server upgrade utility, which upgrades your server
            environment from V5 to V6.  If you choose to install only the
            upgrade utility, no file server components will be installed.

            The upgrade utility allows you to continue to run your V5 servers
            while you perform the upgrade.  You may install the Advanced Server
            after your server environment has been upgraded.

            However, if you choose not to install the upgrade utility only,
            the installation will proceed with the regular kit installation.
            You may invoke the upgrade utility after the installation by typing
            @SYS$UPDATE:PWRK$V6UPGRADE.

         This procedure is used to invoke the Upgrade utility.
         This command procedure will ask you a few questions
         before starting the Upgrade utility.

         If you're upgrading this server as a backup domain controller it
         needs to communicate with the primary domain controller (PDC).
         In order to communicate with the PDC a transport needs to be
         started.

         Will this server be upgraded as a BDC or Member server?
        [NO]: Y <Return>

         The upgrade procedure uses only one of the transports configured on
         the server. Choose a transport, and make sure that the designated
         primary domain controller is running that transport.

         This PATHWORKS server is configured to use DECnet, NetBEUI, TCP/IP.

         Which transport do you want to use for upgrade? [DECnet]: <Return>
