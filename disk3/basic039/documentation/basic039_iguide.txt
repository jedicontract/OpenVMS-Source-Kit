              Your distribution kit includes a letter titled Read Before
              Installing or Using Compaq BASIC Version 3.9 for OpenVMS
              VAX Systems. This letter discusses important information
              that might not be included in this guide. You should read
              this letter now. You should also review the Compaq BASIC
              Release Notes before continuing with the installation. For
              information on accessing the Release Notes, see Chapter 2.

        1.1 Registering Your Software License

              Before you install and run Compaq BASIC Version 3.9 on a
              newly licensed node or an Open VMScluster environment, you
              must first register a License Product Authorization Key
              (License PAK) using the License Management Facility (LMF).
              The License PAK may be shipped along with the kit if you
              ordered the license and media together; otherwise, it is
              shipped separately to a location based on your license
              order. If you are installing Compaq BASIC as an update
              on a node or cluster already licensed for this software,
              you have already completed the License PAK registration
              requirements.

              If you are installing prerequisite or optional software
              along with Compaq BASIC, review the PAK status and install
              the PAKs for any prerequisite or optional software before
              you install Compaq BASIC.

              You must register and load your license for Compaq BASIC
              before you start the installation in order to run the
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and use the
              software.

           To register a license under the OpenVMS operating system,
           first log in to a priviliged account. You then have a
           choice of two ways to perform the registration:

           o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When
              it prompts you for information, respond with data from
              your License PAK.

           o  At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command
              with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to
              License PAK information.

           If you plan to use Compaq BASIC on more than one node in
           an Open VMScluster environment, you will need to perform
           a license load on the other nodes after you complete this
           installation. See Section 3.2 for more information.

           For complete information about using the LMF, see the
           OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

     1.2 Required Hardware

           For a complete list of required hardware and supported
           processors, see the Compaq BASIC Version 3.9 Software
           Product Description (SPD).

     1.3 Required Operating System Components, and Software

           Compaq BASIC Version 3.9 for OpenVMS Alpha systems
           requires OpenVMS for VAX Systems Version 5.5-2 to 7.2-1.

           The following optional software can be used with Compaq
           BASIC:

           o  Oracle CDD/Repository

           o  Language-Sensitive Editor

           o  Source Code Analyzer

     1.4 Installation Procedure Requirements

           This section describes the requirements for installing
           Compaq BASIC (process account quotas, system parameters,
           disk space, and so on).

        1.4.1 VMSINSTAL Checks

              VMSINSTAL checks:

              o  If the user is logged into a privileged account

              o  If any other processes are running on the system

              o  If the minimum account quotas are met

        1.4.2 Account Privileges

              To install Compaq BASIC, you must be logged in to an
              account that has SETPRV or at least the following
              privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

              Note that VMSINSTAL turns off BYPASS privilege at the
              start of the installation.

              Privileges required for product use are defined in
              Section 3.3.1.

        1.4.3 Disk Space

              Compaq BASIC requirements for free disk storage space
              are different during installation and after installation.
              Table 1-1 summarizes the storage requirements.

     1.4.4 Backing Up Your System Disk

           At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if
           you have backed up your system disk. It is recommended
           that you do a system disk backup before installing any
           software.

           Use the backup procedures that are established at your
           site. For details on performing a system disk backup, see
           the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS System
           Manager's Manual.

                                                 Installing Compaq BASIC



              After you register and load your License PAK, the
              installation takes approximately 15 to 45 minutes,
              depending on your system configuration and the kit
              components chosen.

              If you encounter any failures during installation, see
              Appendix C.

        2.1 Installation Procedure

              Mount the media.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all the files it has created up to that point and
              exits. You can then start the installation again.

              When the system prompts you with a question during the
              installation procedure, the default answer is often listed
              in brackets ([]).

              To install Compaq BASIC, perform the following steps:

              1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
                 device and directory to SYS$UPDATE:

                  Username: SYSTEM
                  Password:

                 $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE

              2. Invoke VMSINSTAL:

                 $ @VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name option-list

                 VMSINSTAL is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. The
                 parameters that you specify when you invoke the
                 VMSINSTAL command procedure are as follows:

                                             Installing Compaq BASIC 2-1

 






              saveset-name
              The installation name for the component. For Compaq
              BASIC, enter the following installation name (n is the
              minor point release number):

              BASIC03n

              device-name
              The name of the device on which you have mounted
              the media containing the Compaq BASIC save set. For
              example, MKA400: is the device name used in examples in
              this guide.

              To specify the device name on the @VMSINSTAL command
              line, enter:

              MKA400:

              option-list
              The word OPTIONS followed by one or more of the
              following option designators-A, G, L, N, R:

              o  Auto_answer option (A)

                 Initially creates a file that contains your answers
                 to VMSINSTAL questions and prompts. You can then use
                 the option (and the answer file) to save time during
                 a reinstallation (typically after upgrading your
                 system).

              o  Get save-set option (G)

                 Lets you store product save sets temporarily on a
                 magnetic tape or in a disk directory.

              o  File log option (L)

                 Logs all activity to the terminal during installa-
                 tion.

              o  Display or print the release notes (N)

                 Indicates that you want to see the installation
                 question on release notes. If you do not include
                 the N option, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about
                 the release notes. You should review the release
                 notes before proceeding with the installation in
                 case they contain additional information about the
                 installation.

                    If you are restarting the installation and have
                    already reviewed the release notes, you do not
                    need to specify the N option. (Even if you omit
                    the N option when you invoke VMSINSTAL, the Compaq
                    BASIC release notes are copied automatically to the
                    SYS$HELP directory.)

                 o  Alternate root option (R)

                    Lets you install the product to a system root other
                    than that of the running system.

                 For detailed information on these software installation
                 options, see the OpenVMS operating system documenta-
                 tion. If you specify more than one option, separate
                 each option with a comma, such as:

                 OPTIONS A,N

                 The following example invokes VMSINSTAL to install
                 Compaq BASIC and shows the system response. This
                 example uses the OPTIONS N release note option.

                 $ @VMSINSTAL BASIC03n MKA400: OPTIONS N

                       OpenVMS VAX Software Product Installation Procedure V7.2

                 It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.

                 Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

                 If you do not supply the product name, or the device
                 name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information later
                 in the installation procedure.

                 When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks whether you are
                 logged in to a privileged account. It is recommended
                 that you install software from the system manager's
                 account with your default device and directory set to
                 SYS$UPDATE.

                 VMSINSTAL then checks to determine whether any users
                 are logged in to the system. If users are logged
                 in, VMSINSTAL asks whether you want to continue the
                 installation:

                 * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

                                             Installing Compaq BASIC 2-3

 






              If you want to continue, enter Y. If you want to stop
              the installation, press Return.

           3. Confirm system backup.

              * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

              If you are satisfied with the backup of your system
              disk, press Return. Otherwise, enter N to discontinue
              the installation. After you back up your system disk,
              you can restart the installation.

              If you omitted the device name on the VMSINSTAL command
              line, the following prompt appears:

              * Where will the distribution volumes be mounted:

              If this prompt appears, enter the location of the
              distribution media that contains the Compaq BASIC kit
              (save sets). For example, if the media is contained on
              a tape located on unit MKA400:, enter MKA400: in reply
              to this question.

              If you omitted the product name on the VMSINSTAL
              command line, the following prompt appears:

              Products:

              Enter the kit name, BASIC03n.

              If you did not choose an installation option at the
              options prompt on the VMSINSTAL command line, the
              following prompt appears and you can enter one of the
              installation options:

              Enter installation options you wish to use (none): N

              Depending on the type of device and whether the device
              is already mounted, the following prompt may appear:

              Please mount the first volume of the set on MKA400:.
              * Are you ready? YES
              %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, MKA400:  mounted

              If you have not already done so, you should now insert
              the distribution volume on the device you specified
              when you invoked VMSINSTAL. The device name appears in
              the line preceding the question. VMSINSTAL then asks if
              you are ready to continue with the installation.

     2-4 Installing Compaq BASIC

 






                 If you respond Y to indicate that you are ready,
                 VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing
                 Compaq BASIC has been mounted on the specified device
                 and that the installation has begun.

                 If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
                 VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, enter N
                 in response to the "Are you ready?" question. To stop
                 the installation for other reasons, press Ctrl/Y.

              4. Verify the product being installed.

                  The following products will be processed:

                    BASIC V3.n

                    Beginning installation of BASIC V3.n  at hh:mm

                    %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

                 The product name and version are displayed. The
                 first save set (A) is restored to a subdirectory of
                 SYS$UPDATE:.

              5. Select a release notes option.

                 Release Notes Options:

                  1.  Display release notes
                  2.  Print release notes
                  3.  Both 1 and 2
                  4.  Copy release notes to SYS$HELP

                 * Select option [2]:

                 If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL
                 or at the options prompt, you are now asked to choose
                 one of the options for reviewing the release notes. All
                 options copy the release notes to SYS$HELP.

                 If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes immediately on the console terminal. You can
                 terminate the display at any time by pressing Ctrl/C.

                 If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for the
                 name of the print queue that you want to use. Either
                 supply the name of the print queue that you want to use
                 or press Return to send the file to the default output
                 print device. For example:

              * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: CLUSTER_PRINT

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes immediately on the console terminal and then
              prompts you for a queue name for the printed version.

              If you select option 4, the installation procedure will
              only copy the release notes to the SYS$HELP directory.

              Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to SYS$HELP.

                     Compaq BASIC V3.n Installation beginning at hh:mm:ss.cc

                Copyright 2000 Compaq Computer Corporation

              The release notes are copied to the following file in
              the SYS$HELP directory:

              BASIC03n.RELEASE_NOTES

              After the installation, you can enter the following
              command to view the location of the release notes
              through the Help facility:

              $ HELP BASIC RELEASE_NOTES

           6. Select installation options.

              The installation procedure lets you select the
              components of the kit that you want to install. The
              choices are as follows:

                  There are three possible installation options.  They are described
                  as follows:

                  1) Perform a complete installation of Compaq BASIC.

                  2) Install OpenVMS VAX system definitions text library only
                     (10-45 minutes).

                  3) Obtain a copy of the Compaq BASIC message text for modification.

               * Which option do you want to use [1]:

              If you specifiy choice 1, which is the default, the
              installation continues.

     2-6 Installing Compaq BASIC

 






                 Select the components you want to install by answering
                 Y or N to the questions. If you want a more detailed
                 description of any component, enter a question mark
                 (?). After the explanation is displayed, you will be
                 prompted again for a response.

                 If you enter Y, the installation procedure installs the
                 component.

              7. Install BASIC HELP files.

                 * Do you want to install the BASIC HELP files [YES]?

                 The HELP files describe how to invoke Compaq BASIC from
                 the DCL command line and the BASIC language features.
                 The HELP files require 500 blocks of disk space. It is
                 recommended that you install these files.

              8. Install OpenVMS VAX system definitions.

                 * Do you want to install the OpenVMS VAX system definitions
                 (10-45 min.) [NO]?

                 This option generates a text library (SYS$LIBRARY:BASIC$STARLET.TLB)
                 that contains OpenVMS VAX system definitions. Depending
                 on your processor and system load, creating this
                 library requires approximately 10 to 45 minutes. The
                 OpenVMS VAX system definitions require 6500 blocks of
                 disk space.

              9. Install Compaq BASIC graphics support examples.

                 * Do you want to install the sample graphic programs [NO]?

                 Answering YES to this options puts the Compaq BASIC
                 sample graphic programs into the SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.BASIC]
                 directory. These programs require 400 blocks of disk
                 space, and illustrate how to use Compaq BASIC graphics.

              10.Install Motif definitions.

                 * Do you want to install the Motif definitions [YES]?

                 Answering YES to this option puts the Compaq BASIC
                 version of the Motif definitions, DECW$MOTIF.BAS,
                 into the SYS$LIBRARY directory. These definitions
                 require 1600 blocks of disk space and contain the
                 Constant, Record, and External declarations needed
                 to do Motif programming. Examples are also put into the

                                             Installing Compaq BASIC 2-7

 






              DECW$EXAMPLES area provided it exists. Note that if the
              DECW$EXAMPLES area does not exist, the default for this
              question is NO, and the examples are not provided.

           11.Purge files.

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

              The directories SYS$HELP, SYS$LIBRARY, SYS$MESSAGE,
              SYS$SYSTEM, SYS$TEST, and SYS$EXAMPLES may contain
              previous versions of Compaq BASIC files. These files
              are replaced during the installation with new files,
              but the old files are not automatically purged. Purging
              is recommended. In response to the purging prompt,
              press Return or enter Y to purge the files, or enter N
              to keep them.

           12.Respond to license registration queries.

              Compaq BASIC supports the OpenVMS License Management
              Facility (LMF). The installation procedure displays
              license information about Compaq BASIC. It asks
              whether you have registered and loaded your Product
              Authorization Key (PAK) for each product. The following
              is an example of the information and the queries
              presented by the installation procedure:

                    Product:      BASIC
                    Producer:     DEC
                    Version:      3.n
                    Release Date: dd-mmm-yyyy

              * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

              If you have not registered and loaded your PAK,
              you must answer NO to this question. You have to
              register and load a PAK to successfully complete the
              installation (see Section 1.1). If you have not done
              so, you should stop the installation, register and load
              your PAK, and then restart the installation.

           13.Read informational messages.

              At this point, the installation procedure displays a
              number of informational messages that report on the
              progress of the installation. There are no further
              questions. If the installation procedure has been

     2-8 Installing Compaq BASIC

 






                 successful up to this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new
                 or modified files to their target directories, updates
                 help files, and updates DCL tables, if necessary.

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target
                 directories...

                 The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
                 files are updated to include the new versions of the
                 Compaq BASIC help text and the BASIC command-line
                 definition.

                 Also, if you answered Y in response to the prompt that
                 requests a file purge, previous versions of the Compaq
                 BASIC files are now purged.

              14.Observe the IVP.

                 VMSINSTAL now places the IVP files into the directory
                 SYS$TEST and invokes the IVP to verify that Compaq
                 BASIC was installed successfully. You can also run the
                 IVP independently, after Compaq BASIC is installed, to
                 verify that the software is available on your system.
                 You might need to run the IVP after a system failure to
                 make sure that users can access Compaq BASIC. You can
                 do this by invoking the following command procedure:

                 $ @SYS$TEST:BASIC$IVP.COM.

                 If Compaq BASIC was installed successfully, the IVP
                 displays the following:

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-IVPSUCCESS, Compaq BASIC V3.n Installation test PASSED
                 The Compaq BASIC V3.n IVP has succeeded!

              15.End the installation procedure.

                 The end of the installation is indicated by the
                 following message:

                 Installation of BASIC V3.n completed at hh:mm

                 VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

                 Depending on whether you specified parameters on the
                 VMSINSTAL command line, the * Products: prompt or
                 the DCL prompt ($) may appear. If the * Products:
                 prompt appears, you can return to the DCL prompt ($)
                 by pressing Ctrl/Z.

              VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process
              symbol tables during the installation. Therefore,
              if you are going to continue using the installation
              account (such as SYSTEM) and you want to restore these
              symbols, you should log out and log in again.

        ________________________________________________________________

                                           After Installing Compaq BASIC



              After Compaq BASIC is installed, it can be invoked by all
              users with the BASIC command.

              The installation procedure modifies the DCL command table
              so that the BASIC command is recognized and processed.
              However, the previous command table is still in effect
              for those users who are currently logged in. All logged-in
              users who want to use the BASIC command must log out and
              log in again, or use the following DCL command:

              $ SET COMMAND /TABLES=SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES

              You can perform the following tasks after Compaq BASIC is
              installed:

              o  Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
                 separately

              o  Making the product usable in an Open VMScluster
                 environment

        3.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

              You usually run the Installation Verification Procedure
              (IVP) during installation. If you have system problems and
              want to run the IVP separately to ensure the integrity of
              installed files, use the following command:

              $ @SYS$TEST:BASIC$IVP.COM

     3.2 Making Compaq BASIC Usable in an Open VMScluster
         Environment

           If you want to run Compaq BASIC on multiple nodes of an
           Open VMScluster environment, first check to see that you
           have the appropriate software license (see Section 1.1).
           Then, perform the following steps after you install Compaq
           BASIC:

           1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
              on each node on which Compaq BASIC is to be executed.

           2. Use the OpenVMS System Management (SYSMAN) utility to
              execute a set of commands on all cluster nodes, whether
              or not the nodes are licensed to use Compaq BASIC;
              failure to do so may cause unexpected errors for users.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              If you are using a dual-architecture (VAX and Alpha
              systems), heterogeneous cluster, before executing
              these commands, make sure the appropriate logical
              names have been set to define the scope of the
              SYSMAN DO commands. For more information, see the
              OpenVMS system management documentation.

              _____________________________________________________

              While logged in as SYSTEM, or as another user name
              that has the SETPRV privilege or the CMKRNL and
              SYSPRV privileges, use SYSMAN to update the version
              of DCLTABLES.EXE available, as follows:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSMAN
              SYSMAN> SET ENVIRONMENT/CLUSTER
              %SYSMAN-I-ENV, current command environment:
                      Clusterwide on local cluster
                      Username SYSTEM       will be used on nonlocal nodes
              SYSMAN> DO INSTALL REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              %SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE1
              %SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE2

              SYSMAN will cause each DO command to be executed on all
              nodes of the local cluster.

     3-2 After Installing Compaq BASIC

 






              3. If Compaq BASIC is installed as a known image, then do
                 the following:

                 SYSMAN> DO INSTALL REPLACE SYS$SYSTEM:BASIC.EXE
                 %SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE1
                 %SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE2

              4. If the Compaq BASIC messages file is installed as known
                 image, then do the following:

                 SYSMAN> DO INSTALL REPLACE SYS$MESSAGE:BASIC$MSG.EXE
                 %SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE1
                 %SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE2

              5. Exit from SYSMAN:

                 SYSMAN> EXIT
                 $

        3.3 Setting User Account Requirements

              To work with Compaq BASIC, user accounts on your system
              must have certain privileges.

        3.3.1 User Account Privileges

              To use Compaq BASIC, each account must have at least the
              TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges. Use the OpenVMS Authorize
              utility to determine whether users have the privileges
              they require.

                                                  Recovering from Errors



              This appendix provides information to help you deal
              with failures or errors that might occur during product
              installation or product use.

        C.1 Failures During Product Installation

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks if you want to continue the
              installation. In some instances, you can enter Y to
              continue. To stop the installation process and correct
              the situation, enter N or press Return. Then, correct the
              problem and restart the installation.

              If errors occur during the installation itself or when
              the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is running,
              VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
              fails, you see the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of Compaq BASIC Version 3.9 has failed!

              If the IVP fails, you see these messages:

              The Compaq BASIC Version 3.9 IVP has failed!

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, Compaq BASIC Version 3.9 Installation test FAILED.

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exist:

              o  The operating system version is incorrect.

              o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  System parameter values for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

                                              Recovering from Errors C-1

 






           o  The product license has not been registered and loaded.

           For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
           conditions, see the OpenVMS documentation on system
           messages, recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software
           installation. If you are notified that any of these
           conditions exist, you should take the appropriate action
           as described in the message.

           For information on installation requirements, see
           Chapter 1.

     C.2 Failures During Product Use

           If you encounter a problem while using Compaq BASIC, and
           your software contract or warranty agreement entitles you
           to telephone support, call Compaq.

           Addendum for an explanation of warranty. If you encounter
           a problem during the warranty period, report the problem
           as previously indicated or follow alternate instructions
           provided by Compaq for reporting SPD nonconformance
           problems.

           When you submit a problem report, kindly take the
           following steps:

           1. Describe as accurately as possible the circumstances
              and state of the system when the problem occurred.
              Include in the description the version number of the
              OpenVMS system and Compaq BASIC being used. Demonstrate
              the problem with specific examples.

           2. Reduce the problem to as small a size as possible.

           3. Remember to include listings of any command files,
              INCLUDE files, relevant data files, and so forth.

           4. Provide a listing of the program.

           5. If the program is longer than 50 lines, submit a copy
              of it electronically or on machine-readable media
              (floppy diskette or magnetic tape). If necessary, also
              submit a copy of the program library used to build the
              application.
