           Digital[TM]is pleased to announce a functional update to
           the License Management Facility of the VMS[[TM]] Operating
           System. The release of LMF V1.1 complements Digital's user-
           based license architecture. Digital has announced Personal
           Use licenses and has increased the number of products
           offering Concurrent Use licenses.

           enhancements, and supports Digital's new Personal Use
           licenses. The following new features are included:

           o  New commands for frequently performed license management
              operations (LICENSE DELETE, LICENSE MOVE, LICENSE COPY)

           o  New RESERVE_UNITS option, to support Digital's Personal
              Use licenses.

           o  Support for reservation lists for all license sytles

           o  More consistent and intuitive command qualifiers

           o  Support for wildcards for operations on groups of licenses

           o  Improved reporting defaults

           For more information about these enhancements, see the VMS
           License Management Utility Manual.
