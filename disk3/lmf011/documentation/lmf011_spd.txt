           36.35.00                Version 1.1

           DESCRIPTION

           This VMS facility allows the system manager to easily de-
           termine which software products are licensed on a standalone
           VAX and on each of the VAX systems in a VAXcluster System.
           It allows the system manager to select the subset of sys-
           tems or users in a VAXcluster that may use the software prod-
           ucts. LMF also provides an audit trail which allows the sys-
           tem manager to track license changes that occur within a VAX-
           cluster system.

           V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the
           VAXcluster Software Product Description (29.78.xx) and in-
           clude CI, Ethernet and Mixed Interconnect configurations.
