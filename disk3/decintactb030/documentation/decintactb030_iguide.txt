                           Updated Information and Application Migration



              This chapter describes updated information that must be
              applied to the existing DECintact documentation set, as
              well as information on migrating DECintact applications
              from OpenVMS VAX to OpenVMS Alpha.

              This chapter contains the following sections:

              o  Section 2.1, Updated Information

              o  Section 2.2, Migrating DECintact Applications from
                 OpenVMS VAX to OpenVMS Alpha

        2.1 Updated Information

              This section describes:

              o  Incorporating a User Edit Routine into the Terminal
                 Manager

              o  Unsupported Features

              o  New Files

              o  New Shareable Images

              The VMS manual names referenced in the DECintact document
              set have been changed with the release of new versions
              of OpenVMS. Please refer to the documentation set that
              accompanies your current version of OpenVMS.

              Except where mentioned in this document, references to VAX
              in the existing documentation are valid for OpenVMS Alpha
              and OpenVMS VAX.

              Some of the DECintact display screens may differ slightly
              from those pictured in the DECintact documentation set.
              Specifically, the DECintact screens have been updated to
              include the new version number.

     Updated Information and Application Migration


           Filenames that contain the DECintact version number have
           also been changed to be consistent with DECintact version
           3.0.

     2.1.1 Incorporating a User Edit Routine into the Terminal
           Manager

           The procedure for incorporating a User Edit Routine
           (UER) into the Terminal Manager has been modified for
           DECintact on OpenVMS Alpha. For information on UERs, see
           the DECintact Application Programming Guide.

           To incorporate a UER into the terminal manager, do the
           following:

           1. Using a text editor, add the file specifications for
              your UERs to the end of the USEREDIT.OPT linker options
              file which is stored in the INTACT$COPY directory.
              Add each UER on a separate line after the following
              commented line:

              ! add linker commands for site-specific editing modules here

              For example, after you add a line for a UER module
              called MY_UER whose .OBJ file is stored on DISK1:[UER_
              DEVELOPMENT], the USEREDIT.OPT file contains the
              following lines:

              ! add linker commands for site-specific editing modules here

              DISK1:[UER_DEVELOPMENT]MY_UER

              SYMBOL_VECTOR = (MY_UER = PROCEDURE)

              On Alpha systems, you need to declare universal symbols
              for each UER by listing them in a SYMBOL_VECTOR= linker
              option. For more information about the SYMBOL_VECTOR
              option, refer to the documentation set that accompanies
              your current version of OpenVMS.

           2. Save the modified linker options file in the directory
              pointed to by the logical name INTACT$VERSION. If you
              use the C programming language, there is no requirement
              to specify the C run-time library in your USEREDIT.OPT
              file. (On Alpha systems, the linker processes the C
              run-time library shareable [DECC$SHARE] by default
              because it resides in the default system shared image

                 library [IMAGELIB.OLB]. For more information about how
                 the linker processes default system libraries, refer
                 to the documentation set that accompanies your current
                 version of OpenVMS.)

              3. Set your default directory to INTACT$COPY.

              4. Relink the Terminal Manager using the following DCL
                 command:

                 $ @INTACT$VERSION:INTACT$REBUILD DSPLCL

                 The OpenVMS Linker produces two executable images:
                 File DSPLCL.EXE contains a non-debuggable version
                 of the Terminal Manager and runs during normal
                 DECintact system startup. File DSPLCL.DBG contains
                 a debuggable version of the Terminal Manager and
                 runs during a debugging session. The OpenVMS Linker
                 stores the DSPLCL.DBG and DSPLCL.EXE files in directory
                 INTACT$COPY. The logical name INTACT$UER_LIBRARY points
                 to the directory that contains the version of the
                 DSPLCL.DBG file produced by the current version of
                 DSPLCL.EXE. By default, INTACT$UER_LIBRARY points to
                 DSPLCL.DBG in INTACT$COPY. To store the file DSPLCL.DBG
                 in a different directory for debugging, redefine the
                 logical name INTACT$UER_LIBRARY and reset it when
                 debugging is complete.

              5. If DSPLCL has been installed, run the INSTALL routine
                 to remove the previously installed version. Do not
                 reinstall the new DSPLCL version until your UER
                 routine has been completely debugged. See the DECintact
                 Installation Guide for information on using INSTALL.

        2.1.2 Unsupported Features

              DECintact System buffers are no longer supported on
              OpenVMS Alpha, and you can no longer allocate buffers
              in VMS nonpaged pool memory. (See the DECintact System
              Management Guide, Section 15.2.4.3) When you enter the
              SET_TRANSACTION_SECTION option, the following prompt will
              still appear on your screen:

     2.1.4 New Shareable Images

           One new shareable image is installed with DECintact V3.0
           for OpenVMS Alpha, INTACT$TRSHR.EXE. This shareable image
           is defined in the logical name table with the /SYSTEM and
           /EXEC qualifiers.

     2.2 Migrating DECintact Applications from OpenVMS VAX to

           This section describes:

           o  Updating User Edit Routines

           o  Translating DECforms

           The DECintact system supports applications that are
           written in the following OpenVMS programming languages:

           o  DEC BASIC for OpenVMS

           o  DEC C for OpenVMS

           o  DEC COBOL for OpenVMS

           o  DEC FORTRAN for OpenVMS

           o  DEC Pascal for OpenVMS

           o  PL/I for OpenVMS

                           Updated Information and Application Migration


              DECintact routines are language-independent and use
              standard OpenVMS procedure calling conventions. The
              DECintact Application Programming Reference Manual
              describes all the DECintact routines used for writing
              applications.

              Call a DECintact routine as an external procedure using
              the syntax appropriate to your programming language.
              Unless otherwise noted, pass all arguments to DECintact
              routines by reference, that is, pass the addresses of the
              arguments, not the values.

              For information on moving existing DECintact Applications
              on OpenVMS VAX to OpenVMS Alpha, refer to the appropriate
              programming language Porting/Migration documentation.

        2.2.1 Updating User Edit Routines

              When you migrate a DECintact applications from OpenVMS
              VAX to OpenVMS Alpha, you must modify your USEREDIT.OPT
              file to incorporate your UER into the Terminal Manager.
              For information on incorporating UERs into the Terminal
              Manager, see Section 2.1.1.

        2.2.2 Translating DECforms

              When you use the DECforms TRANSLATE command, it is
              recommended that you specify the /NOMEMBER_ALIGNMENT
              qualifier. Specifying this qualifier causes record fields
              to be aligned by byte. Each record field begins on the
              first byte after the previous record field.

              For compatibility between VAX and Alpha platforms
              this switch will only affect the Alpha run-time record
              alignments, the VAX run-time records will always be byte
              aligned. In this way, the produced .FORM file will be
              compatible between platforms.

           you can either display or print during the installation
           procedure.

     3-2 Preparing for DECintact Installation on OpenVMS Alpha

 



                   Preparing for DECintact Installation on OpenVMS Alpha


              The prompt to display or print the release notes appears
              in the installation procedure, as noted in the description
              of step 6, ( Section 4.1) only when you invoke the
              VMSINSTAL command procedure with the N option.

                ______________________  Note  _______________________

                For access to the release notes before you install
                the DECintact system, follow the installation
                procedure (see Section 4.1) up to step 6, in which
                you can choose to read or print the release notes
                and discontinue the installation procedure.

                _____________________________________________________

              To read the release notes after the installation, display
              or print the file SYS$HELP:DECINTACT030.RELEASE_NOTES.

              The DECintact help that is available through accessing
              DCL help also directs you to the release notes file. After
              installation, enter the following command:

              $ HELP INTACT RELEASE_NOTES <Return>

        3.1.3 Contents of the Distribution Kit

              The DECintact software kit consists of the software media
              and the documentation required to install the product.
              The primary media is CDROM. The required software licenses
              must be purchased separately.

              DECintact systems support the LMF features provided
              by OpenVMS; LMF requires registration of a Product
              Authorization Key (PAK).

              The bill of materials specifies the contents of your
              kit. Check the contents of your kit against the list
              in the bill of materials. If your kit is damaged or if
              you find that parts of it are missing, call your DIGITAL
              representative.

              For information about mounting the distribution media as
              well as several options to the installation procedure, see
              your OpenVMS documentation set.

     Preparing for DECintact Installation on OpenVMS Alpha


           A list of files added to your system during installation
           can be found in the DECintact Installation Guide. Any
           additional files specific to DECintact V3.0 for OpenVMS
           Alpha are listed in Section 2.1.3 and Section 2.1.4. The
           installation procedure defines the installation directory
           that you specify during the installation as group logical
           name INTACT$VERSION. Most DEC intact files added to your
           system are located in INTACT$VERSION or subdirectories of
           this directory. See the DECintact System Management Guide
           for information about the DECintact directory structure.

     3.1.4 Required Operating System Components

           The OpenVMS operating system comes with a variety of
           support options, or classes. Classes include such features
           as networking and RMS journaling. For a complete list of
           the required classes, see the DECintact Software Product
           Description (SPD).

     3.2 Prerequisite Software

           You must have a valid version of OpenVMS installed on
           your system before installing the DECintact system. To
           determine what version of the OpenVMS operating system is
           running, enter the following command:

           $ SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

           The first line of the ensuing display shows the version of
           the OpenVMS operating system.

           VMSINSTAL checks for the correct version of OpenVMS; if
           you have an incorrect version, VMSINSTAL fails.

           For the current supported software version, refer to the
           DECintact Software Product Description (SPD).

     3.3 Checking the Setup of DECdtm Services

           To ensure that DECdtm software is set up correctly for all
           nodes that use the DECintact system, perform the following
           actions:

           1. Check that the system logical name SYS$DECDTM_INHIBIT
              is not defined. If this logical name is defined, remove
              it from SYLOGICALS.COM and reboot the system.

                   Preparing for DECintact Installation on OpenVMS Alpha


              2. Check to see that the following System Generation
                 Utility (SYSGEN) parameters are defined:

                 o  SCSNODE

                 o  SCSSYSTEMID

                 These parameters must be defined for DECintact to
                 support the DECdtm software. If they are not defined,
                 edit SYS$MODPARAMS.DAT, the parameter data file used
                 by the AUTOGEN command procedure, and use AUTOGEN to
                 define this SYSGEN parameter. (See steps 3 and 4 in
                 Section 3.6.3.)

              3. Check that the system logical name SYS$JOURNAL is
                 defined for a valid device and directory. See the
                 DECintact Installation Guide for more information about
                 defining SYS$JOURNAL.

              4. Check to see that the system processes TP_SERVER and
                 IPCACP are started. If these processes are not started,
                 execute the DECDTM$STARTUP.COM procedure by entering
                 the following command:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:DECDTM$STARTUP.COM FULL

                 Running this procedure provides information explaining
                 the problem that prevents DECdtm services from
                 starting. When the problem is diagnosed and solved,
                 reboot the system to restart DECdtm services.

              5. Using the Log Manager Control Program (LMCP) Utility,
                 ensure that the DECdtm transaction log is defined for
                 every node of the cluster where the DECintact system
                 is used. See the DECintact Installation Guide for more
                 information about defining the DECdtm transaction log.

        3.4 Optional Software

              After meeting the requirements for prerequisite software,
              you can also install any of the latest supported versions
              of the following software products:

              o  DECforms

              For currently supported software versions, refer to the
              DECintact Software Product Description (SPD).

        3.5 License Registration

              Register a DECintact system license through the OpenVMS
              License Management (LMF) in accordance with the license
              agreement signed by your site. License registration
              information is contained in the Product Authorization
              Key (PAK) that you must purchase separately. The PAK is
              a paper certificate that contains information about the
              license you have purchased to run the DECintact software.

              Before installing the DECintact system, register and
              load the PAK. To register your PAK, log in to the SYSTEM
              account. Then, enter the following command:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM <Return>

              Refer to your OpenVMS documentation set for information
              pertaining to this command procedure and to the management
              features of LMF. During the installation, the system asks
              whether you registered the DECintact license and loaded

               Preparing for DECintact Installation on OpenVMS Alpha 3-7

 



     Preparing for DECintact Installation on OpenVMS Alpha


           the appropriate authorization key. When the system prompts
           you for information, respond with the data from your PAK.

           If you plan to use the DECintact system on more than one
           node in a OpenVMS Cluster system, perform a license load
           on the other nodes after you complete this installation.

     3.6 Installation Procedure Requirements

           This section discusses the following topics that deal with
           various requirements for installing the DECintact system:

           This section describes:

           o  User Identification Code with Installation Verification
              Procedure

           o  Process Privileges and Quotas

           o  System Parameters

           o  Disk Space

           o  VMSINSTAL Requirements

           o  Backing up Your System Disk

           o  Time Required for Installation

     3.6.1 User Identification Code with Installation Verification
           Procedure

           The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) must run
           within a group that has an established groupwide logical
           name table. To run the IVP, you, the installer, must be
           in your default User Identification Code (UIC). If you
           are not currently running from your own UIC, use the SET
           UIC command to return to your default UIC before running
           VMSINSTAL.

           Note that the DECintact product does not have to be
           installed from the SYSTEM account.

        3.6.2 Process Privileges and Quotas

              To install the DECintact system, you need either the
              SETPRV privilege or both of the following privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  TMPMBX

              The following privileges are also required to run the IVP:

              o  ALTPRI

              o  DETACH

              o  GROUP

              o  GRPNAM

              o  GRPPRV

              o  LOG_IO

              o  NETMBX

              o  PFNMAP

              o  PRMGBL

              o  SHARE

              o  SHMEM

              o  SYSGBL

              o  SYSLCK

              o  SYSNAM

              o  SYSPRV

              Note that as the VMSINSTAL command procedure executes,
              it turns off the BYPASS privilege at the start of the
              installation.

              Table 3-2 shows the minimum process quotas needed for
              installing the DECintact system.

           To check or change process quotas, use the OpenVMS
           Authorize Utility. The following two examples illustrate
           checking and changing the quotas for the SYSTEM account.

           To check the quotas you currently have, enter the
           following commands:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>

           $RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>

           UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

           UAF> EXIT <Return>

           $

           To change a process quota-the ASTLM value for example-
           enter the following commands, substituting the appropriate
           process name and value where this example shows ASTLM=24:

              UAF> EXIT <Return>

              $

              If you change any quotas with the OpenVMS Authorize
              Utility, you must log out of the system and log back in
              for them to take effect. The OpenVMS Authorize Utility is
              described in your OpenVMS documentation set.

        3.6.3 System Parameters

              Table 3-3 shows the minimum values for SYSGEN system
              parameters required for installation.

     Preparing for DECintact Installation on OpenVMS Alpha


           To ensure that your system had the required SYSGEN
           system parameter quotas for the installation, perform
           the following steps:

           Step 1. Check the current SYSGEN system parameter values.

           Check each of the following SYSGEN system parameter values
           by entering the command in the example following each
           listed parameter:

           o  GBLSECTIONS-Number of free global sections

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS") <Return>

              12

           o  GBLPAGES-Number of free global pages

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES") <Return>

              4636

           o  WSMAX-Size of current working set maximum

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("WSMAX") <Return>

              4096

           Step 2. Calculate the number of unused global sections and
           pages needed.

           To determine the number of additional unused global
           sections and pages needed, perform the following
           calculation for GBLSECTIONS and GBLPAGES:

              Subtract the current number unused for the parameter
              (the value obtained for the parameter in step 1. from
              the required total number unused for the parameter (as
              specified in Table 3-3).

           If the value of the difference is greater than zero, you
           need to change the value of the parameter.

           The following examples show this calculation for these
           parameters:

           o  Additional global sections needed

              25-12=13 unused sections needed

     3-12 Preparing for DECintact Installation on OpenVMS Alpha

 



                   Preparing for DECintact Installation on OpenVMS Alpha


                 In this example, the difference, 13, is greater than
                 zero and represents the number of additional unused
                 global sections needed to install the DECintact system.

              o  Additional global pages needed

                 6,000-4,636=1,364 unused pages needed

                 In this example, the difference, 1,364, is greater than
                 zero and represents the number of additional unused
                 global pages needed to install the DECintact system.

              Step 3. Edit the system parameters.

              If you must change these or any other system parameters,
              plan to change them before you begin the installation
              procedure. To modify the values for the global sections
              and pages parameters, edit SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT,
              the parameter data file used by the AUTOGEN procedure.
              For example, to provide additional global sections and
              pages based on the values calculated in step 2, edit
              MODPARAMS.DAT and add the following lines, or change the
              existing lines as follows:

              ADD_GBLSECTIONS=13

              ADD_GBLPAGES=1364

              Step 4. Activate the new parameters.

              Because the global sections and global pages parameters
              are not dynamic, you must run AUTOGEN to recompute them.
              Enter the following command sequence to shut down the
              OpenVMS system and reboot, activating the new system
              parameters:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN SAVPARAMS GENPARAMS <Return>

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN SETPARAMS REBOOT <Return>

              For further information on using AUTOGEN, refer to your
              OpenVMS documentation set.

     Preparing for DECintact Installation on OpenVMS Alpha


     3.6.4 Disk Space

           You can install the DECintact system on either your system
           disk, or another disk. Consider the following information
           when deciding where to create the INTACT$VERSION
           directory:

              Building the AVERTZ sample application requires ap-
              proximately 20,000 blocks to accommodate files in three
              subdirectories below directory INTACT$VERSION:[EXAMPLES.AVERTZ],
              using one subdirectory for each of the following:

              o  Oracle Rdb database

              o  AVERTZ executable files

              o  OpenVMS CCD/Plus dictionary

           If disk quotas are set on your system, ensure that
           they are sufficient to accommodate DECintact disk space
           requirements.

           To determine the number of free blocks on the disk that
           you designate for the installation, enter the following
           command:

           $ SHOW DEVICE devicename: <Return>

     3.6.4.1 Disk Space if Installation Disk is the System Disk

           To install the DECintact system on your system disk,
           provide the following disk space:

           o  85,000 blocks for peak disk-block utilization

           o  75,000 blocks for net disk-block utilization

     3.6.4.2 Disk Space if Installation Disk is Not the System Disk

           If you are installing the DECintact system on a disk other
           than the system disk, you must still provide the following
           disk space:

           o  System disk

                 - 65,000 blocks for peak disk-block utilization
                 - 10,000 blocks for net disk-block utilization

           o  Installation disk

                 - 75,000 blocks for peak disk-block utilization

                    - 75,000 blocks for net disk-block utilization

        3.6.5 VMSINSTAL Requirements

              When you invoke the VMSINSTAL command procedure, it checks
              the following:

              o  Whether you have set your default device and directory
                 to SYS$UPDATE

              o  Whether you are logged into a privileged account

              o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation

              o  Whether DECnet is running

              o  Whether any users are logged in to the system

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks you if you want to continue the
              installation. In some instances, you can enter YES to
              continue. To stop the installation process and correct
              the situation, enter NO or press Return. Then correct the
              problem and restart the installation.

        3.6.6 Backing up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if
              you have backed up your system disk. DIGITAL recommends
              that you do a system disk backup before installing any
              software.

              Use the backup procedures that are established at your
              site. For details on performing a system disk backup,
              refer to your OpenVMS documentation set.

        3.6.7 Time Required for Installation

              Installing the DECintact system takes approximately 10-30
              minutes.

              If you are unfamiliar with VMSINSTAL, the OpenVMS
              operating system, or the configuration of your system,
              allocate a minimum of two hours to read the referenced
              documentation and gather the required information.

                        Installing the DECintact System on OpenVMS Alpha



              This chapter describes the steps to install the DECintact
              system on OpenVMS Alpha. It is made up of the following
              sections:

              o  Section 4.1, Performing the Installation

              o  Section 4.2, Error Conditions

              The DECintact installation procedure consists of a
              series of questions and informational messages. When
              responding to a prompt, press the Return key after
              entering your response. If you need additional help during
              the installation, enter a question mark (?) in response
              to any prompt; the installation procedure displays an
              explanation of possible valid responses. For a sample of a
              DECintact installation, see Appendix A.

              To abort the installation procedure, press Ctrl/Y. When
              you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure deletes
              all files it has created up to that point (but not
              their directories) and exits. To retry the installation
              procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, proceed from step 2.

              Enhancements to VMSINSTAL in future releases of the
              OpenVMS operating system might result in additional
              system prompts during installation. Although these
              installation instructions do not include these prompts in
              the installation procedure, the installation can proceed
              normally.

                        Installing the DECintact System on OpenVMS Alpha


              Step 2. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

              To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command
              procedure, located in the SYS$UPDATE directory, by
              entering a DCL command in the following format:

              @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name OPTIONS N

              where:

              saveset- Is the installation name for the component to
              name     install. For the DECintact system, use the
                       following installation name, which identifies
                       the product name and version number:

                       DECINTACT030

              device-  Is the name of the device on which you plan to

           OPTIONS  Is an optional parameter that indicates you
           N        want to see the prompt to display or print
                    the release notes. If you omit the OPTIONS N
                    parameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about the
                    release notes. The release notes can contain
                    additional information about the installation;
                    review the release notes before proceeding
                    with the installation. If you are restarting
                    the installation and have already reviewed
                    the release notes, you do not need to specify
                    OPTIONS N. The release notes are always placed in
                    SYS$HELP, whether or not you specify OPTIONS N.

                    Note that there are several other options you can
                    select when you invoke VMSINSTAL:

                    o  Auto_answer option (A)-Initially creates a
                       file that contains your answers to VMSINSTAL
                       questions and prompts. You can then use the
                       option (and the answer file) to save time
                       during a reinstallation (typically after
                       upgrading your system).

                    o  Get save-set option (G)-Lets you store product
                       save sets temporarily on a magnetic tape or in
                       a disk directory.

                    o  File log option (L)-Logs all activity to the
                       terminal during installation.

                    o  Alternate root option (R)-Lets you install the
                       product to a system root other than that of
                       the running system.

                    See your OpenVMS documentation set for detailed
                    information on these options. If you specify more
                    than one option, separate the options with commas
                    (OPTIONS A,N).

           The following example invokes VMSINSTAL to install Version
           3.0 of the DECintact system from CD ROM drive DKA1: and
           shows the system response. This example uses the OPTIONS N
           release note parameter.

                        Installing the DECintact System on OpenVMS Alpha


              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL DECINTACT030 DKA1: OPTIONS N

              OpenVMS AXP Software Product Installation Procedure V6.2-1H3

              It is 23-JUL-1997 at 10:43.
              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              After invoking VMSINSTAL, you receive several prompts
              and messages that explain and direct the installation.
              If you do not supply either the product name or device
              name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information later in
              the installation procedure. If VMSINSTAL prompts you for
              a device name after you have already provided one, you
              are probably naming a device that is not available on the
              system. VMSINSTAL continues to prompt you for a device
              until you name a valid one.

              VMSINSTAL does not prompt you for any options, so be sure
              to include OPTIONS N on the VMSINSTAL command line to
              access the release notes during the installation.

              Step 3. Check any warning messages that ask you if you
              want to continue.

              If you do not complete the installation procedure
              described in previous sections of this manual, the
              procedure displays warnings about existing problems and
              issues a prompt asking you if you want to continue.

              Correct any problems before continuing the installation
              procedure. If you continue without correcting the problem,
              DIGITAL may not support the resulting installation. The
              following example shows a warning message:

              %VMSINSTAL-W-DECNET, Your DECnet network is up and running.
              Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?

              If you answer NO, VMSINSTAL returns you to DCL command
              level. After you shut down the network, you must return
              to step 2. to run VMSINSTAL again. If you answer YES, the
              installation continues normally.

              Step 4. VMSINSTAL checks that you have backed up your
              system disk.

              *Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?
              YES <Return>

     Installing the DECintact System on OpenVMS Alpha


           If you have not backed up your system disk, do not
           continue with the installation. If you need to back up
           the system disk, answer NO. VMSINSTAL exits and returns
           you to the DCL prompt. Back up your system disk, and then
           start the installation procedure at step 2.

           If you have already backed up the system disk, answer YES.

           See the appropriate OpenVMS software installation guide.
           For general information on backups, see your OpenVMS
           documentation set.

           Step 5. Select a release notes option.

           This step applies only if you selected OPTIONS N in step
           2.

               Additional Release Notes Options:

               (1) Display release notes
               (2) Print release notes
               (3) Both 1 and 2
               (4) None of the above

           * Select option [2]: 2 <Return>

           If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
           notes immediately on your screen. If you select option 2
           or option 3, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue name.

           * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

           You can enter a queue name or press Return to indicate the
           default output print device, SYS$PRINT. VMSINSTAL responds
           with an informational message indicating the queue used,
           which is SI$8700 in the following example:

           Job INTACT030 (queue SI$8700, entry 1794) started on SYS$PRINT

           Next, or if you select option 4, VMSINSTAL displays a
           prompt asking you if you want to continue the installa-
           tion:

           * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]?: YES <Return>

           %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to
           SYS$HELP.

                        Installing the DECintact System on OpenVMS Alpha


              If you answer NO, VMSINSTAL terminates the installation.

                ______________________  Note  ________________________

                The name of the release notes file installed by
                VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name and
                version number. It is good practice to keep release
                notes for previous versions of the DECintact system.

                _____________________________________________________

              Step 6. Decide whether to purge files.

              New generations of the files SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE and
              SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB are created during installation of
              the DECintact system. VMSINSTAL asks you whether you want
              to purge the old files:

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?:

              To purge the old copies of these two files after
              installation, answer YES in response to the preceding
              question. If you do not want to purge the old generations
              of these files, answer NO.

              Step 7. Select the device and directory.

              VMSINSTAL explains how to perform this step and prompts
              for the destination device and directory name where all
              DECintact V3.0 files are to reside. Supply the destination
              device and directory name.

                ______________________  Note  _______________________

                You must provide a new directory name, that is, the
                name of a directory that does not currently exist.

                _____________________________________________________

              In response to the next question, please enter destination
              device and directory specification for DECintact files. The
              directory name must be a new directory name, that is, the name
              of a directory that does not exist. This directory will be the
              INTACT$VERSION directory once the installation is complete. The
              INTACT$COPY directory will be a subdirectory below this.
	 
              The default device and directory are: SYS$SYSDEVICE:[DECINTACT030]

              *Installation device and directory [SYS$SYSDEVICE:[DECINTACT030]]:

     Installing the DECintact System on OpenVMS Alpha


           Step 8. Select and verify the software license.

           The installation procedure displays license information
           about the DECintact product and asks the following two
           questions to verify that a DECintact license has been
           installed before the product is installed. For each
           question, supply an appropriate answer.

           Please answer the next question by selecting the number which
           represents the currently loaded DECintact license.

               (1) DECINTACT
               (2) DECINTACT-RT
               (3) DECINTACT-REM

           * Which license have you registered and loaded [1]: 1

               Product: DECINTACT
               Producer: DEC
               Version: 3.0
               Release Date:23-JULY-1997

           * Does this product have an authorization key registered and
	     loaded? YES

           If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you must
           answer NO to this question. You have to load and register
           your PAK to successfully complete the installation. If you
           have not done so, stop the installation, register and load
           your PAK, and then restart the installation.

           Step 9. Read the informational messages.

           If LSE is not installed or if a license for LSE is not
           loaded, the procedure displays the following message and
           instructions:

              *************************************************************

              The OpenVMS Language-Sensitive Editor is not installed on your
              system. To have the OpenVMS Language-Sensitive Editor support,
              you must:

               1.  Load the OpenVMS Language-Sensitive Editor License

              If an unsupported version of LSE is installed, the
              procedure displays the following message and instructions:

                 *************************************************************

                 OpenVMS LSE nn.nn is installed on your system. To use the
                 OpenVMS Language-Sensitive Editor template for DECintact system
                 calls, you must:

                  1.  Install DEC LSE 3.0 or higher.
                  2.  @Intact$version:Intact$update_lse.com

                 *************************************************************

              where

              nn.nn    Is the version number of LSE installed on your
                       system.

              VMSINSTAL then displays the following informational
              messages. Note that system disk directory messages are
              displayed only if you are installing the DECintact system
              on the system disk.

              All interactive input for the installation of DECintact
	      V3.0 is now complete. It will take approximately 10 to 30
	      minutes to complete the installation depending on your
	      system and kit media.

              Step 10. Check installation verification messages.

              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs
              automatically. Check that your system responses are
              the same. If not, identify the problem as described in
              Section 4.2.

           Note that VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the
           process tables during the installation. Therefore, if you
           try to invoke the installation from the system manager's
           account and you want to continue to use that account and
           restore those symbols, log out and log in again.

     4.2 Error Conditions

              One or more of the following conditions can cause an error
              during the installation:

              o  Insufficient disk space to complete installation

              o  Insufficient AST quota

              o  Insufficient buffered I/O byte count

              o  Insufficient open file quota

              o  Insufficient process paging file quota

              o  Insufficient process working set quota

              o  Insufficient maximum working set

              o  Incorrect version of OpenVMS

              For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
              conditions, see your OpenVMS documentation set.

              If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
              take the appropriate action, as described in the message.
              You may need to change a system parameter (with SYSGEN) or
              increase an authorized quota value (with AUTHORIZE). If
              the installation fails, restart the installation procedure
              from step 2.

              For a list of the more common messages specific to
              the DECintact system issued by VMSINSTAL, refer to the
              DECintact Installation Guide.

              If the Installation Verification Procedure fails, you
              receive messages explaining the failure. These IVP
              messages are also listed in the DECintact Installation
              Guide.
