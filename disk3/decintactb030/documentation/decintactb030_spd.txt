         DESCRIPTION

         The DIGITAL[TM] DECintact[TM] product provides a foundation for
         building simple and complex transaction processing
         applications on one or more systems under the OpenVMS[TM]
         operating system. The DECintact product runs as a collection
         of services and several processes under the OpenVMS operating
         system. DECintact supports either single-threaded (per-process)
         or multithreaded (server) application program design method-
         ologies. Multiple versions of the DECintact product can execute
         at the same time and share the same physical memory, while
         remaining completely independent. The DECintact product offers
         the following major facilities:

         o  Front-end services

         o  Database services

         o  Two-phase commit

         DIGITAL DECintact, Version 3.0                        SPD
         29.58.06


         The DIGITAL DECintact product supports DIGITAL DECforms[TM]
         forms or DIGITAL DECintact forms within DECintact
         terminal-based applications. A single system menu can display
         multiple applications, some using DECforms and some using
         DECintact forms. However, a single application can not mix
         forms products.

         DIGITAL DECforms Forms

         Access to DECforms services is available through a set of
         DECintact routines. For more information on DECforms, refer
         to the DECforms Software Product Description (SPD 29.90.xx).
         DIGITAL DECintact forms

         DECintact forms supports VT100[TM], VT200[TM], VT300[TM] and
         VT400[TM] (in VT200 emulation mode) series terminals as though
         they were intelligent block-mode terminals. Programmers
         create screen forms interactively through the Terminal Forms
         Editor (TFE). Forms are virtual in length, and multiple forms
         can be windowed on a single terminal. Fields on a form have
         video and edit attributes, which are handled by the terminal
         management facility. A user-written edit routine facility
         exists, which allows character, field, and form editing to be
         augmented by the programmer. The ability to print a hard copy
         of the screen is a built-in service of the terminal man-
         agement facility.

         Database Services

         The DECintact product allows multithreaded applications to
         access synchronous resource managers such as Oracle Rdb[TM]
         and Oracle CODASYL DBMS[TM]. Also included are facilities to
         monitor/configure this environment (that is, control the
         number of server pool instances, and monitor overall server
         pool throughput).

         Two-Phase Commit

         Utilizing the DECdtm[TM] component of the OpenVMS operating
         system, the DECintact product can coordinate distributed
         transactions to perform atomic updates to multiple and
         different resource managers that are DECdtm compliant (for
         example, Oracle Rdb, Oracle CODASYL DBMS and DECintact queues).

         DIGITAL DECintact, Version 3.0                        SPD
         29.58.06


         Oracle TRACE Option for Rdb Support

         The DECintact product allows the collection of performance
         event data by Oracle TRACE at two levels. The first level
         allows the collection of performance event data from within the
         DECintact code. The second level involves allowing application
         programmers to insert Oracle TRACE calls into their application
         code.

         LSE Templates

         The DECintact product provides LSE DECintact routine templates
         to allow programmers to generate DECintact applications more
         quickly and accurately.

         Security and Menu Dispatching

         The DECintact product provides a comprehensive security and
         menu system. A mechanism for establishing security profiles
         for local/remote users and terminals is provided. The DECintact
         product makes use of a hierarchical menu system that permits
         references to both lower-level menus and to menu functions
         directly invoking applications. All menu items can be
         protected, and users are shown only those items for which they
         have proper entitlement. Hours of operation, password
         expiration, transaction audit, and response-time reports are
         among the features of the DECintact security system.

         File Management

         DIGITAL's Record Management Services (RMS[TM]) is used for file
         and record access. The DECintact File Management facility
         improves upon its use of the RMS facility by supporting shared
         relative files, logically deleted records, and implicit file
         openings. The DECintact product also supplies its own hash
         file access support, which provides a high performance method
         of inserting and retrieving records. All record operations are
         considered atomic for the purposes of restart/recovery.

         There are two options for recovery of RMS files: DECintact
         Recovery and RMS Journaling. Both coordinate with DECdtm
         (Two-Phase Commit) to

         29.58.06


         provide both recovery-unit journaling and after-image
         journaling. DECintact users can choose either recovery method
         (DECintact or RMS Journaling) on a file by file basis.

         DECintact Recovery

         This service is provided as part of the base DECintact product.

         RMS Journaling

         This is an optional service. For information on RMS Journaling,
         refer to the RMS Journaling Software Product Description (SPD
         27.58.xx).

         Queue Management

         The DECintact product provides a comprehensive set of routines
         that support the creation of disk-based and memory-based
         queues. A queue consists of items that are priority ordered
         with up to 65,000 priority classes per queue. Queue items may
         be inserted FIFO or in priority order and are removed either
         FIFO or atomic for the purposes of restart/recovery. All
         disk-based queues are fully recoverable. The DECintact
         product supports remote queues, queue sets, multiple queue in-
         sertions, enqueue-level threshold alarms, and proof and
         reconciliation statistics.

         Network Management

         The DECintact product supports explicit and implicit remote
         access at the menu-item level and uses DECnet[TM] facilities
         for intersystem communications. Network access is supported
         at two levels: peer-to-peer and front-end-to-host. Peer-to-peer
         access allows users with sufficient entitlement to invoke
         applications remotely on another participating DECintact
         system. Front-end-to-host access provides a transparent
         method of off-loading forms management (including both built-
         in and user-written validation) and menu level security from a
         host onto a front-end system. A front-end system also offers
         automatic host failure rollover in the event that a CPU within
         a host cluster system fails.

         OpenVMS Cluster[TM] Features

         DIGITAL DECintact, Version 3.0                        SPD
         29.58.06


         The DECintact product supports the building of simple, as well
         as complex, OpenVMS Cluster applications. All DECintact file
         accesses, as well as all disk-based queue operations, use the
         OpenVMS distributed lock manager to arbitrate cluster wide
         system resources. The DECintact system support of OpenVMS
         Cluster features, in conjunction with its own restart/recovery
         strategies, can be used to simplify the implementation of
         high availability applications.

         Development Option

         The DECintact Development Option provides all features of the
         product for development and deployment of an application.

         Run-Time Option

         As a subset of the Development Option, the DECintact Run-Time
         Option allows existing, developed applications to be run in a
         production environment under an alternate license. This
         option does not provide the facilities for developing
         applications.

         Remote-Access Option

         As a subset of the Run-Time Option, the Remote-Access Option
         provides the ability to off-load the Terminal Management
         Facilities in a distributed application environment, to
         ``remote'' or ``front-end'' systems under an alternate
         license.

         Conformance to Standards

         Standards Industry Practice Conformance

         There are no relevant formal standards, industry specifications
         or practices, certificates or conformance documents to which
         DECintact adheres or conforms.
