Chapter 1

Preparing for Digital SNA 3270 Application Services Installation

This chapter describes the preparations and requirements necessary for
installing  Digital SNA 3270 Application Services software.

Your bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report (BIL) specify the
number  and contents of your media.  Be sure to verify the contents of your
kit with  this information.  If your kit is damaged or if you find that
parts of it are  missing, contact your Digital representative.

The Digital SNA 3270 Application Services software provides on-line release
notes  that describe any undocumented features.  Digital strongly
recommends that  you read the release notes before proceeding with the
installation.  For information  about accessing the on-line release notes,
see Section 2.1.

1.1   Required Operating System Components

The OpenVMS operating system comes with a variety of support options, or
classes.  Classes include such features as networking and RMS journaling. 
To use the  Digital SNA 3270 Application Services product, your system should
be running a  version of OpenVMS that includes the following classes:

o OpenVMS required saveset

o Network support

o Utilities

o Programming support

For a complete list of the required classes, see the Software Support
Addendum  (SSA 38.70.xxA), which comes with the Software Product
Description (SPD).

1.2   Prerequisite Hardware

The Digital SNA 3270 Application Services software can be installed on any Alpha
system, VAX, MicroVAX, or VAXstation configuration as specified in the
System  Support Addendum (SSA 38.70.xxA).  In addition to the Alpha or VAX
processor,  you will need specific hardware for the DEC SNA Domain Gateway
product.  Refer  to the Domain Gateway SSA for more information.

1.3   Prerequisite and Optional Software

Table 1-1 provides information about the software you must have installed
on  your system before installing the Digital SNA 3270 Application Services
software.  The System Software Addendum (SSA) contains a complete list of
prerequisite  and optional software and their required version numbers.

Table 1-1 Prerequisite Software

Required Software               Minimum Version



OpenVMS VAX                     V6.1

OpenVMS Alpha                   V6.1

DECnet-VAX                      V6.1

DECnet for OpenVMS Alpha        V6.1

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX      V6.1

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS Alpha    V6.1

DEC SNA Domain Gateway          V2.0


Use the SHOW SYSTEM command to determine the current version of the OpenVMS 
operating system on your processor.  If you do not have the required
version,  you must install it before you install the Digital SNA 3270
Application Services  software.

Use the MCR NCP SHOW EXEC CHAR command to determine the current version of 
the DECnet software on your processor.  If the command is successful, check 
the returned version of the DECnet software.  If a previous version of the 
software is present, you must install the required version before you
install  the Digital SNA 3270 Application Services software.

If the MCR NCP SHOW EXEC CHAR command fails, use the NCL SHOW VERSION
command  to determine if your node has the minimum required version of
DECnet/OSI software.  If so, you may proceed to install the 3270
Application Services software.

If both commands fail, your node has no DECnet software.  You must install 
the required DECnet software before installing the Digital SNA 3270 Application 
Services software.

If you are installing prerequisite or optional software along with the Digital
SNA 3270 Application Services software, review the Product Authorization
Key  (PAK) status and install PAKs for any prerequisite or optional
software before  you install the 3270 Application Services software.

1.3.1     Required DEC VTX Version

As part of the installation, the DEC SNA 3270 Application Services software 
provides a new version of the DEC VTX Terminal Control Program.  The new
version  of VTX uses the 3270 Application Services interface (the API). 
While VTX is  not needed for all installations, you must have a valid VTX
license and be  running VTX V4.0 or later, or VTX TR V1.0 or later to use
this version of VTX.

To verify the version of VTX that you are using, enter the following
command

$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:VTXCTL  

The VTX version is displayed on your screen. 

1.4   Print Symbiont Planning

Each OpenVMS print queue can point to a different IBM printer, and can have 
its own unique parameters.  Refer to section 7.2 of the Digital SNA 3270
Application  Services Programming and Management book for more information
on print queue  parameters.  Using the following table, fill in the queue
names you plan to  use and their associated parameters, and refer to this
information during installation.

1.5   License Registration

You must register and load your license for the Digital SNA 3270 Application
Services  product before you start the installation in order to run the
Installation  Verification Procedure (IVP) and use the software.

To register a license under OpenVMS, first log in to the system manager's
account,  SYSTEM. You then have a choice of two ways to perform the
registration:

o Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it prompts you for
information, respond with data from your License PAK.

o At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command with the appropriate 
qualifiers that correspond to License PAK information.

If you plan to use the Digital SNA 3270 Application Services software on more
than  one node in a VMScluster, you will need to perform a license load on
the other  nodes after you complete this installation. See Section 3.3.

For complete information on using the License Management Facility (LMF), see 
the OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

1.6   Installation Procedure Requirements

This section and those that follow discuss various requirements for
installing the Digital SNA 3270 Application Services software.

The installation takes approximately 5 to 25 minutes, depending on your type 
of media and your system configuration.

1.6.1     Privileges and Disk Space

To install the Digital SNA 3270 Application Services software, you must be
logged  in to an account that has SYSPRV privileges.  Use the SHOW
PROCESS/PRIVILEGES  command to check the account privileges.

Note that VMSINSTAL turns off BYPASS privileges at the start of the
installation.

The Digital SNA 3270 Application Services requirements for free disk storage
space  are different during installation and after installation.  Table 1-2
summarizes  the storage requirements.

Table 1-2 Disk Space Requirements

3270 Application        Blocks During           Blocks After 
Services                Installation            Installation

With DECforms           22000                   7500


To determine the number of free disk blocks on the current system disk,
enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

$ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

1.6.2     Process Account Quotas

The account you use to install the Digital SNA 3270 Application Services
software  must have certain minimum quotas to allow you to perform the
installation.  Table 1-3 summarizes the minimum process quotas required for
the installation  account.

Table 1-3 Minimum Process Account Quotas for the Installation Account

Account Quota           Value

ASTLM                   24

BIOLM                   18

BYTLM                   18000

DIOLM                   18

ENQLM                   30

FILLM                   20


User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT.  Use the OpenVMS
Authorize  utility (AUTHORIZE) to verify and change user account quotas. 
First set your  directory to SYS$SYSTEM and then run AUTHORIZE:

$ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM 
$ RUN AUTHORIZE 
UAF>

At the UAF> prompt, enter the SHOW command with an account name to check a 
particular account.  For example:

UAF> SHOW SMITH

To change a quota, enter the MODIFY command.  The following example changes 
the FILLM quota for the SMITH account and then exits from the utility:

UAF> MODIFY SMITH /FILLM=50 
UAF> EXIT

After you exit from the utility, the system displays messages indicating
whether  or not changes were made.  In order for the changes to take
effect, the account  changed  must be logged out and then logged in again. 

For more information about modifying account quotas, see the description of 
the Authorize utility in the OpenVMS System Management Subkit.

1.6.3      VMSINSTAL Requirements

When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

o Whether you are logged in to a privileged account

o Whether you have adequate quotas for installation

o Whether DECnet is running

o Whether any users are logged in to the system

If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation, it notifies you 
and asks if you want to continue the installation.  In some instances, you 
can enter YES to continue.  To stop the installation process and correct
the  situation, enter NO or press Return.  Then correct the problem and
restart the installation.

1.6.4     Backing Up Your System Disk

At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if you have backed up 
your system disk.  Digital recommends that you do a system disk backup
before  installing any software.  The OpenVMS System Manager's Manual
explains how  to back up your system disk.



Chapter 2

Installing the Software

This chapter explains how to install the 3270 Application Services
software.  Section 2.1 contains a step-by-step description of the
installation procedure. 
 

2.1   The Installation Procedure

The procedure for installing the software on an OpenVMS system is
automated.  You answer the questions displayed while the procedure runs. 
Most questions  require a yes or no answer.  Depending on the type of media
you use, the 3270  Application Services software installation should take

To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL command procedure from a
privileged  account, such as the SYSTEM account.  VMSINSTAL is in the
SYS$UPDATE directory.  The following list defines the elements of the
VMSINSTAL command procedure:

saveset-name
The installation name for the component. For 3270 Application Services use 
the following installation name:

R3270012 

device-name
A device name where the distribution kit will be mounted for the 3270
Application  Services installation media, where dd is the device, c is the
controller, and  u is the unit number.  For example, MTA0: is the device
name for a tape drive.  It is not necessary to use the console drive to
install the 3270 Application  Services software.

OPTIONS N
An optional parameter you should provide if you want to be prompted to
display  or print the release notes.  If you do not include the OPTIONS N
parameter,  VMSINSTAL does not prompt you to display or print the release
notes, but does  copy them to SYS$HELP.  VMSINSTAL also provides several
other options.  For  more information about the options, see your
processor-specific installation  or operations guide.

Username: SYSTEM

* Enter SLU name (name of printer)[SLUNAME]: T112F011
* Enter name of translation table file to use for queue: 
* Enter queue name (or ^Z when done) [R3270$PRINTER2]:

VMSINSTAL prompts you for the name of the queue, the name of the default
form  to use with the queue, the name of the SNA Gateway to use with the
queue, the  PLU name, the LOGMODE name, the SLU name, and the default
translation table  for the queue (see the Digital SNA 3270 Application Services
Programming and Management  manual for more information about naming these
resources).  The list of questions  repeats allowing you to assign more
than one queue to the print symbiont.   Enter another queue name to assign
another print queue, or enter  Ctrl/Z to end the process.  If you do not
want to create the print symbiont startup file now, enter Ctrl/Z.  A
template startup file containing instructions for starting the print 
symbiont will be created.

  Note  

VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process symbol tables during
the  installation.  Therefore, if you are going to continue using the
system manager's  account and want to restore those symbols, you should log
out and log in again.

2.2   Error Recovery

If errors occur during the installation itself or when the Installation
Verification  Procedure (IVP) is running, VMSINSTAL displays failure
messages.  If the installation  fails, you see the following message:

%VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of Digital SNA 3270 Application Services 
V1.2 has failed.

If the IVP fails, you see these messages:

The Digital SNA 3270 Application Services V1.2 Installation Verification
Procedure failed.

%VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for Digital SNA 3270 Application Services V1.2
has failed.

Errors can occur during the installation under any of these conditions:

o The operating system version is incorrect.

o A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

o Not enough free space on the system disk.

o Quotas necessary for successful installation are insufficient.

o System parameter values for successful installation are insufficient.

o The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

o The product license has not been registered and loaded.

For descriptions of the error messages generated by these conditions, see
the  OpenVMS documentation on system messages, recovery procedures, and
OpenVMS  software installation.  If you are notified that any of these
conditions exist,  you should take the appropriate action as described in
the message.  For information  about installation requirements, see Chapter
1.
 

Chapter 3

After Installing the 3270 Application Services Software

You should complete the following tasks after installing the Digital SNA 3270
Application Services software:

o Run the Installation Verification Procedure separately.

o Edit the system startup and shutdown files.

o Make the product usable on a VMScluster.

o Set user account quotas.

o Report problems.

3.1   Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

You usually run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) during
installation.  If you want to run the IVP separately to ensure the
integrity of installed  files should system problems occur, execute the
following command procedure:

$ @SYS$UPDATE:R3270$IVP.COM

The following message indicates that the software has been successfully
installed:

** Digital SNA 3270 Application Services V1.2 Installation Test **

....  Testing Digital SNA 3270 Application Services V1.2 

** Digital SNA 3270 Application Services V1.2 Test Successful **


  Note  

The IVP does not verify that the 3270 Application Services software can
connect to an IBM system.


If the software was not installed properly, VMSINSTAL displays error
messages.  Correct the problems indicated by the messages and rerun the
installation  procedure.  If you receive IVP errors, you have a damaged
kit; contact your  Digital representative.

For information about configuring your IBM SNA software components for the 
Digital SNA 3270 Application Services product , see the DEC SNA Domain Gateway 
Guide to IBM Resource Definition.

If you have not registered 3270 services with LMF, the following text
appears:

** Digital SNA 3270 Application Services V1.2 Installation Test **

%LICENSE-F-NOAUTH, DEC SNA-3270-SVCS-DEV Application Services use is not
authorized on this node
-LICENSE-F-NOLICENSE, no license is active for this software product
-LICENSE-I-SYSMGR, please see your system manager
%Failed to test program with shareable image

** Digital SNA 3270 Application Services V1.2 Test FAILED ** 

Stop the installation and register the 3270 Application Services software
with LMF.

3.2   Editing the System Files

You must edit the system startup and shutdown files to provide for
automatic  startup and shutdown of 3270 Application Services when your
system is rebooted.

Add the command line that starts 3270 Application Services to the system
startup  file, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_*.COM. The 3270 Application Services
software cannot  start until after the network has started.  You must
position this new command  line after the line that invokes the network
startup command procedure.  The  following example shows the network
startup command line followed by the 3270  Application Services startup
command line:

$ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
$ .
$ .
$ .
$ @SYS$STARTUP:R3270$STARTUP.COM

3.3   VMScluster Considerations

After you have installed 3270 Application Services software on one node of 
a VMSclusterTM, you can activate it on other nodes of the VMScluster by
executing  the R3270$STARTUP.COM procedure on each node as follows:

$ @SYS$STARTUP:R3270$STARTUP.COM


You must activate a 3270 Application Services license for each node in the 

VMScluster that will execute and run 3270 Application Services software.
You can activate the license in one of the following ways: 

o Log in to each VMScluster node and enter the LICENSE LOAD command.

o Invoke the OpenVMS SYSMAN utility to execute the LICENSE LOAD command on 
the desired VMScluster nodes.  See the OpenVMS SYSMAN Utility Manual for
details  on defining your management environment and executing commands on
other nodes.

For more information about the LICENSE LOAD command, refer to the OpenVMS
License Management Utility Manual.

3.4   User Account Requirements

To work with 3270 Application Services, user accounts on your system must
have  certain privileges and quotas.  The next two sections contain
information about  these requirements.

3.4.1     Privileges

To use 3270 Application Services, each account must have at least the
TMPMBX  and NETMBX privileges.  If the account is going to be creating a
DECnet object,  it will also need the SYSNAM privilege.  Use the OpenVMS
Authorize utility  to determine whether users have the privileges they
require.

3.4.2     User Account Quotas

You must make sure that the appropriate user accounts have sufficient
quotas  to be able to use 3270 Application Services.  Table 3-1 summarizes
the required  user account quotas.

Table 3-1 User Account Quotas for Using 3270 Application Services

Account Quota     Value

ASTLM             24

BIOLM             18

BYTLM             18000

DIOLM             18

ENQLM             30

FILLM             20

See Section 1.5.2 for a description of how to verify and change account
quotas.

3.5   Determining and Reporting Problems

If you encounter a problem while using 3270 Application Services, report it 
to Digital.  Depending on the nature of the problem and the type of support 
you have, you can take one of the following actions:

o Call Digital if your software contract or warranty agreement entitles you 
to telephone support.

o Submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

o Fill out and submit a Reader's Comments form if the problem has to do
with  the 3270 Application Services documentation.  There are Reader's
Comments forms  at the back of each manual.  Use the form from the manual
in which you found  the error.  Include the section and page number.

Review the Software Product Description (SPD) and Warranty Addendum for an 
explanation of warranty.  If you encounter a problem during the warranty
period,  report the problem as just indicated or follow alternate
instructions provided  by Digital for reporting SPD nonconformance
problems.
