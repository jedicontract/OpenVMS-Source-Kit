DESCRIPTION

Compaq NAS Client 150 Version 8.3A for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] Worksta-
tions is a member of the NAS Client/Server Packages family. Each NAS
package is a software product providing a license for the NAS prod-
uct and documentation.

NAS Client 150 Version 8.3A consists of a set of components that pro-
vide a basic client environment for distributed network applications
on OpenVMS VAX workstations. These components, along with the oper-
ating system, provide uniform services that enable applications to be
distributed in heterogeneous client/server environments.

The NAS Version 8.3A release documents revisions to component prod-
ucts since the previous NAS release. NAS 8.3A supports Compaq Open-
VMS Operating System Version 7.3

Use of the components of NAS Client 150 Version 8.3A requires a li-
cense for NAS Client 150 Version 8.3A in combination with the Open-
VMS VAX Operating System.

The version of each NAS component licensed, is as stated within the
OpenVMS VAX Software Products Library of the calendar quarter in which
the NAS PAK is dated. Update licenses may be purchased for use of later
versions of any component.

Table 1 lists the components included in NAS Client 150 for OpenVMS
VAX and summarizes license and media information for each component.
Special cases are covered by footnotes.

tation. The KIT directory is not used.

You may print the electronic documentation accompanying the Compaq NAS
Packages as reasonably necessary to exercise your license to use Com-
paq NAS packages.

INSTALLATION

Compaq recommends that customers unfamiliar with the components of NAS
Client 150 for OpenVMS VAX Workstations purchase Compaq Installation
Services. These services provide for installation of the software prod-
uct by an experienced Compaq Software Specialist.

Only software kits expressly identified in this SPD can be used to in-
stall components of NAS Client 150 for OpenVMS VAX Workstations. Use
of other software kits may result in inoperable software configura-
tions and may invalidate the software product warranty or software ser-
vice contract.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The NAS Client 150 supports all valid OpenVMS VAX workstations. For
questions about the hardware requirements for individual component prod-
ucts, customers should consult the HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS section of
individual component SPDs.

Memory Requirements

The minimum supported memory for installation of NAS Client 150 for
OpenVMS VAX Workstations, with all components and subcomponents in-
stalled is 32 MB.

The performance and memory usage of NAS Client 150 for OpenVMS VAX and
applications based on it are particularly sensitive to system config-
uration. Full configuration of all subcomponents may require memory
in excess of the minimum quoted above. Additional memory may also be
required based on system loading and usage patterns of the components.


                                 4

 

More or less memory may be required depending on whether clients and
servers execute on the same system or on different systems. Additional
memory may also improve performance of one or more components.

Refer to the component SPDs and installation guides for detailed in-
formation about memory usage by components and subcomponents of the
NAS Client 150 for OpenVMS VAX.

Disk Space Requirements

When installing the complete set of components of NAS Client 150 for
OpenVMS VAX, customers must have a minimum of 260 MB of disk space avail-
able.

This count refers to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the customer's
system environment, configuration, and software options. For example,
actual disk space required may be less if the customer does not in-
stall some components or subcomponents. Customers may require addi-
tional disk space to create or expand component databases or to cre-
ate user files.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Compaq NAS Packages, Version 8.3A run on the following version of the
OpenVMS operating system:
OpenVMS VAX Version 7.3.

See the Compaq NAS Installation Guide, Appendix D, NAS/Operating Sys-
tem Compatibility Matrix for a list of NAS component versions support-
ing other Operating System versions.

GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS
