              Installing BASEstar Graphics Enabler on OpenVMS AXP Systems


              This chapter describes the preparation, installation
              instructions, and tasks performed after installation for
              the BASEstar Graphics Enabler.

        Preparing for BASEstar Graphics Enabler Installation

              Your distribution kit includes a letter titled Read Before
              Installing BASEstar Graphics Enabler. This letter discusses
              important information that might not be included in this
              chapter. You should read this letter now.

        Registering Your Software License

              Before you install and run BASEstar Graphics Enabler
              Version 2.3, you must first register a License Product
              Authorization Key (License PAK) using the License
              Management Facility (LMF). The License PAK may be shipped
              along with the kit if you ordered the license and media
              together; otherwise, it is shipped separately to a location
              based on your license order.

              You must register and load your license for the BASEstar
              Graphics Enabler before you start the installation in order
              to run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and
              use the software.

              The BASEstar Graphics Enabler has several license options,
              one of which is Personal Use licensing. A Personal Use
              license must be reserved to a particular OpenVMS user name
              before it can be loaded. To reserve and load a license, use
              the following commands:

              $ LICENSE MODIFY BGE-DEV /RESERVE=username
              $ LICENSE LOAD BGE-DEV

              where username is the name of the OpenVMS user for whom the
              license will be reserved.

              The minimum hardware required for the successful
              installation and operation of BASEstar Graphics Enabler
              software components is a Workstation or terminal that
              supports the X Window System.

        Required Operating System Components and Software

              Before installing BASEstar Graphics Enabler on OpenVMS AXP
              systems, ensure that OpenVMS AXP Version 6.1 or higher and
              the necessary components of DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
              AXP are already installed.

        Installation Procedure Requirements

              This section describes the requirements for installing
              BASEstar Graphics Enabler (privileges, disk space, and
              backing up your system disk).

        Privileges

              To install the BASEstar Graphics Enabler, you must be
              logged in to an account that has SETPRV or at least the
              following privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

        Disk Space

              BASEstar Graphics Enabler's requirement for free disk
              storage space are different during installation and
              after installation. Table 1-1 summarizes the storage
              requirements. The space requirements are approximations;
              actual sizes may vary depending on your system environment
              and configuration.

        Backing Up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if you
              have backed up your system disk. Digital recommends that
              you do a system disk backup before installing any software.

              Use the backup procedures that are established at your
              site. For details on performing a system disk backup, see
              the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS System
              Management Subkit.

        Installing BASEstar Graphics Enabler

              When your system meets all the hardware and software
              prerequisites, you can install the BASEstar Graphics
              Enabler. The installation takes from 2 to 30 minutes,
              depending on system load and configuration and the
              installation options selected.

              Install the BASEstar Graphics Enabler on OpenVMS AXP
              systems using the following steps:

              1. Log in to a privileged system manager's account.

              2. Set the default directory to SYS$UPDATE:

                 $  SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE

              3. Invoke VMSINSTAL:

                 $  @VMSINSTAL BGE023 device:

                 where BGE023 is the kit name and device: is the name of
                 the device on which you plan to mount your media or the
                 current location of the kit.

                 VMSINSTAL prompts you for information during the
                 installation.

        Logical Names

              The BASEstar Graphics Enabler uses the following logical
              names:

              o  BGE$DB-Defines the full path name to DEC Rdb.

              o  BGE$MODELS-Provides a directory search list for locating
                 model and binding files, in addition to the current
                 default directory. This search list is used both when
                 creating binding files and when running models. If this
                 logical name is not defined, only the current working
                 directory will be used.

              o  BGE$MSG_SIZE-For BASEstar Classic users only. Provides
                 a value used when creating BASEstar Message Ports for
                 the maximum message size allowed by the port. If this
                 logical name is not defined, the default value of 500 is
                 used.

              o  BGE$MSG_QUEUE-For BASEstar Classic users only. Provides
                 a value used when creating BASEstar Message Ports for
                 the maximum number of messages allowed by the port. If
                 this logical name is not defined, the default value of
                 50 is used.

              o  BGE$PREFIX-Provides a string that is preappended to the
                 names of source objects. For BASEstar Open users, this
                 can be used to specify the Domain. BASEstar Open users
                 can also use BGE$DOMAIN for this purpose.

              o  BGE$WCPF-Provides an integer value to specify a World
                 Coordinate Pixel Factor for all data sources.

              Note that these logical names must be defined in the GROUP
              or SYSTEM name tables, so that they will be seen by the
              detached processes created by the BASEstar Graphics Enabler
              Runtime component.

              In the following example, the BGE$MODELS logical is defined
              in the GROUP name table so that all users sharing the same
              UIC group will have access to the models:

              $ DEFINE/GROUP BGE$MODELS device:[directory]

              In the following example, the BGE$MODELS logical is defined
              in the SYSTEM name table so that all users on the system
              will use the same value:

              $ DEFINE/SYSTEM BGE$MODELS device:[directory]

              For more information on defining logical names, refer to
              the OpenVMS DCL Dictionary.

              installing the BASEstar Graphics Enabler.

        Editing the Startup Command File

              You must edit the system startup file to provide for
              automatic startup of BASEstar Graphics Enabler when your
              system is rebooted. The installation creates a startup
              command file called BGE$STARTUP.COM in SYS$STARTUP. Edit
              the site-specific startup file SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_
              VMS.COM and add the following line:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:BGE$STARTUP
