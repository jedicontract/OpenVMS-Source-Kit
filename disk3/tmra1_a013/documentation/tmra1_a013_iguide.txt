                                                            Release Notes


              This chapter describes:

              o  The main changes made in TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version
                 1.3A

              o  The known problems and restrictions that are in
                 TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3A.

        1.1 Changes in TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3A

              The main changes in TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3A
              are:

              o  Modifications to support ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2 running on
                 OpenVMS VAX and Alpha systems.

        1.2 Known Problems and Restrictions

              The following sections describe the known problems and
              restrictions in TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3A.

        1.2.1 TeamRoute Option Fails to Work

              After a second-architecture installation, the TeamRoute
              (TMR) option may fail to work. This happens when TeamRoute
              for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3 is present on a VAX system when
              second-architecture support for ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2
              is added on an Alpha system. It may also occur after
              an upgrade from TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3 to
              TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3A.

              Workaround:

              If this problem occurs, recompile the SITEOAFORM forms
              library.

                                                        Release Notes 1-1

 



    Release Notes
    1.2 Known Problems and Restrictions


    1.2.2 Function not Implemented after Upgrade

          After an upgrade from TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3
          running on ALL-IN-1 Version 3.1 to TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
          Version 1.3A running on ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2, the TMR
          option on the Main form may give an error "Function TMR
          not implemented in this version". This happens because the
          upgrade of ALL-IN-1 installed a new version of SITEOALIB.

          Workaround:

          Move the Teamroute OA$SCT$SDF elements back to live area
          and relink ALL-IN-1

    1.2.3 Running Multiple Service Agents

          Problems occur when more than one Service Agent runs in
          a cluster. It is not normally possible for more than one
          Service Agent to start, so these problems are likely to
          occur only in unusual circumstances.

    1.2.4 Converting Attachments

          Attachments that are created and attached on TeamRoute
          for ALL-IN-1 may be converted when sent to a user on
          TeamRoute for OpenVMS or TeamLinks. This means that updates
          to revisable attachments cannot be applied to the master.

          TeamRoute clients that use DEC MAILworks[TM] support the
          same data type and file conversion capability that is
          available with DEC MAILworks. That is, if a converter is
          available for the attachment data type, and the user's
          profile options have been set to allow the conversion, the
          DEC MAILworks server converts the files on delivery.

          When sending routing packages with WPS-PLUS[TM] attachments
          from the TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 client to TeamRoute for
          OpenVMS or TeamLinks clients, the attachment files may
          be converted. To prevent the conversion of revisable
          attachments that are intended to remain in WPS-PLUS format,
          set the DEC MAILworks user profile option to accept types
          of WPS-PLUS.

                                                            Release Notes
                                      1.2 Known Problems and Restrictions


        1.2.5 Addressing TeamRoute Packages

              You cannot send TeamRoute packages to distribution lists or
              to ALL-IN-1 groups.

        1.2.6 Granting Mail Access

              TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 does not support the use of the
              GMA (Grant mail access) and SMU (Set mail user) options in
              ALL-IN-1.

              You can use the GMA and SMU options to give other users
              access to the mail in your ALL-IN-1 account in the usual
              way. However, those users cannot read or process any
              TeamRoute packages in your ALL-IN-1 account.

        1.2.7 Renaming ALL-IN-1 Accounts

              If you rename a TeamRoute user's ALL-IN-1 account, the
              user can access all existing routing packages from the new
              account. This includes all master routing packages and any
              unread packages from the old account name.

              The following restrictions apply when an ALL-IN-1 account
              is renamed:

              o  On any packages that the user has initiated, the name of
                 the initiator does not change. Thus, as the package is
                 routed, the user's old name can be seen.

              o  If another user has routed a package to the user's old
                 name, and the package has not yet reached the renamed
                 user, it will not be delivered to the new account name.

        1.2.8 Transferring TeamRoute Accounts

              Support is not currently available for transferring
              TeamRoute accounts to a new system. Before you transfer
              an ALL-IN-1 account that uses TeamRoute, consider the
              following:

              1. The user must read and respond to all new TeamRoute
                 routing packages before you transfer the account.

              2. All outstanding TeamRoute master routing packages
                 initiated by the account being transferred must be
                 processed; that is, all recipients listed in the
                 master routing copy must have received copies and have
                 responded, if appropriate.

                 TMR SELECT routing_package, access_mode

                 This is correctly shown in the example.

                 Note that if access_mode is omitted, the default is
                 OA$_TMR_READ_WRITE. This may not be appropriate for
                 your application and may cause unexpected results.
                 We therefore recommend that you use the local symbol,
                 #TMRCL_APPL_ACCESS_MODE, to provide a value for access_
                 mode.

              TCU includes online help that describes how to use the
              utility.

              Some of the samples in the online help specify /TYPE=TEXT

    _________________________________________________________________

    2.2 Second-Architecture Installations

          In a mixed-architecture cluster, it is important to install
          TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 on each architecture. If you do not
          do this, problems are reported when you relink ALL-IN-1 on
          the system where TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 is absent.

          This problem is likely to occur if, for example, you do
          not have a mixed-architecture cluster when you install
          TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3A, but subsequently add
          an Alpha system to the cluster. If you do this, remember to

                                    2.2 Second-Architecture Installations


              add second-architecture support for TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
              as soon as you install ALL-IN-1 on the new system.

        2.3 Registering a License

              The license registration information you need is contained
              in the Product Authorization Key (PAK). The PAK is a paper
              certificate that contains information about the license you
              need to run a particular piece of software.

              You must register and load your license for TeamRoute for
              ALL-IN-1 before you start the installation procedure.

              To register a license under OpenVMS, first log in to the
              system manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice of
              two ways to perform the registration:

              o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it
                 prompts you for information, respond with data from your
                 License PAK.

              o  At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command
                 with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to
                 License PAK information.

              For complete information on using LMF, see the OpenVMS
              License Management Utility Manual.

        2.4 Checking the ALL-IN-1 Site Link Files

              The TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 installation adds information
              to the ALL-IN-1 site link files, SITELINK32.COM and
              SITELLV.COM. For this to succeed, the following conditions
              must apply:

              o  The files must be in the directory OA$BUILD_SHARE_IND,
                 or, if they have been customized, in OA$SITE_BUILD_
                 SHARE_IND

              o  The format of the files must conform to that of the
                 templates provided in ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2

              o  For upgrade installations, the modifications made to the
                 site link files during the installation of TeamRoute for
                 ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3 must be present

    Preparing to Install TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
    2.4 Checking the ALL-IN-1 Site Link Files


          Before you install TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version
          1.3A, make sure that these conditions are met. If the
          installation procedure cannot modify the site link files,
          the installation fails.

          See Section 3.6.1 for information about what to do if the
          installation fails due to failure to modify the site link
          files.

    2.5 Checking the OA$MTI_TRNS Logical Name

          If the logical name OA$MTI_TRNS is defined on your system,
          it must be set to zero (0)  in order for TeamRoute for
          ALL-IN-1 to run correctly.

          To check the value of the logical name, enter the following
          command:

          $ SHOW LOGICAL OA$MTI_TRNS

          If the value is 0, or if the logical name is not defined on
          your system, take no further action.

          If the logical name is set to 1 or 2, it means that
          your ALL-IN-1 system is configured to translate
          outgoing messages to ASCII text (see the  ALL-IN-1
          Installation: Guide for more details). Before you change
          the configuration of your ALL-IN-1 system, check the
          reasons why this configuration is being used.

          To change the value of the logical name to 0, enter this
          value in the TRANSLATE field in the A1BASE record of the
          ALL-IN-1 configuration database. Do this as follows:

          1. From the ALL-IN-1 manager's ALL-IN-1 account, enter
             A1CONFIG. The ALL-IN-1 System Configuration Information
             form is displayed.

          2. Enter A1BASE to display the record for the base
             component.

          3. Enter C to specify that you want to change the record.

          4. Move the cursor to the TRANSLATE field and enter 0.

          5. Press RETURN to save the changes.

          6. Press RETURN to leave the form.

                    2.6 Checking the TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Logical Names


        2.6 Checking the TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Logical Names

              Before starting an upgrade installation of any sort, check
              that the TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 logical names are defined
              on your system. See Section A.2 for a list of these logical
              names.

              The upgrade installation fails if the TeamRoute for
              ALL-IN-1 logical names are not defined. Define them by
              running the TeamRoute startup procedure, as follows:

              dev is the device holding the TMRA1SERVICE account.

              batch_queue is the queue to which you want to submit the
              startup procedure.

              Before a second-architecture installation of any sort,
              define the logical name TMRA1$SERVICE_DIRECTORY, using the
              same translation as on the first architecture:

        2.7 Disk Space Requirements

              Table 2-5 shows the free disk storage space requirements
              for installing TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1. These requirements
              apply to first time, server-only, and upgrade
              installations.

        2.9 Removing Customized Elements of TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1

              Before an upgrade installation, if your TeamRoute for ALL-
              IN-1 system has been customized, remove from the TeamRoute
              live area any customized versions of Digital-supplied
              TeamRoute elements (that is, those with the prefix TMR).
              Use Customization Management to do this.

              If you do not do this, your customizations may interfere
              with the correct functioning of TeamRoute Version 1.3A.

        2.10 Editing the Site Startup Procedures

              Before an upgrade installation, you must remove any
              existing TeamRoute startup commands from the site startup
              procedures. Do this as follows:

              1. Check for the following file:

                 OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE_IND:A1V32_SITE_START.COM

                 If this file does not exist, you do not need to take any
                 action.

              2. If the file does exist, delete the line that starts as
                 follows:

                 @SYS$STARTUP:TMRA1$STARTUP

    2.10 Editing the Site Startup Procedures


             It is important to remove this line completely, rather
             than commenting it out.

          3. If you have a multilanguage system, make sure that
             this line is not present in any language-specific site
             startup file:

             OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV:OA$SITE_lang_START.COM

          If, after installing TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3A,
          you add an Alpha node to the cluster, install ALL-IN-1 on
          the Alpha node and then start ALL-IN-1, you will get an
          informational message or an error message. If you removed
          the TeamRoute startup commands you get the following
          informational message:

          TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 is not installed for this system

          If you did not remove the TeamRoute startup line, the
          command procedure may fail and subsequent startup commands
          may not be executed. The following message will be
          displayed:

          %DCL-E-OPENIN, error opening SYS$SYSROOT:[SYS$STARTUP]TMRA1$STARTUP.COM; as input
          -RMS-E-FNF, file not found

          In either case, install TeamRoute on the Alpha node.

    3.1 Installing TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 on a Cluster System

          If your ALL-IN-1 system runs in a cluster system, you must
          install TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 on each node where ALL-IN-1
          is running.

    3.2 Registering TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Users

          During installation, you can choose to register existing
          ALL-IN-1 users as TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 users. If you do
          this, a postinstallation procedure populates the TeamRoute
          for ALL-IN-1 profile with the existing accounts in the
          ALL-IN-1 profile, with the exception of the following
          accounts:

                    VMSMAIL
                    VAXMAIL

              On an ALL-IN-1 system with a large number of users, this
              script takes some time to run, and so extends the total
              installation time.

              Once you have installed TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1, you can
              use options on the Manage TeamRoute User Accounts menu to
              register individual users in the TeamRoute profile. Use
              these options if you choose not to register users as part
              of the installation. See Section 5.1 for more information.

        3.3 Keeping a Record of the Installation

              We recommend that you keep a permanent record of the
              installation. To do this, either use a hardcopy terminal,
              or keep a record of the installation in a log file.

              To keep a record in a log file, just before you start the
              installation, enter the following command:

              $ SET HOST 0/LOG=filename

              filename is the name of the log file.

        3.5 Restoring Process Symbols

              During the installation, VMSINSTAL deletes or changes
              entries in the process symbol tables. After the
              installation, to restore these symbols, log out of the
              system manager's account, then log in again.

        3.6 Solving Problems

              If errors occur during the installation, VMSINSTAL displays
              failure messages. If the installation fails, you see the
              following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of TMRA1 has failed.

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exist:

              o  The operating system version is incorrect.

              o  The prerequisite software is not installed.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  System parameter values for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

    Installing TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
    3.6 Solving Problems


          o  The product license has not been registered and loaded.

          o  A site link file has been modified and the installation
             procedure is unable either to remove the old TeamRoute
             link commands or to add the new ones. See Section 3.6.1.

          If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
          take the action described in the message. For information
          on installation requirements, see Chapter 2.

    3.6.1 Modifications to Site Link Files

          In adding information to the site link files, the
          installation procedure uses the format of the template
          files that are provided in ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2. If the
          format of these files has been changed, the installation
          fails.

          During an upgrade, the installation procedure removes the
          modifications that were made to the site link files during
          the installation of TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Version 1.3.
          If the installation procedure cannot find the end point of
          these modifications, the upgrade installation fails.

          If the installation fails for either of these reasons,
          remove customized versions of the site link files from the
          live area. Alternatively, if an upgrade installation fails
          to remove the Version 1.3 modifications, edit the site link
          files manually to remove the modifications, then restart
          the installation.

    3.6.2 Running the IVP

          If the installation succeeds, but the IVP does
          not run successfully, examine the IVP log file,
          SYS$TEST:TMRA1$IVP.LOG, to identify the problem.

          To run the IVP outside the installation, enter the
          following command from a privileged account:

          $ @SYS$TEST:TMRA1$IVP language

          language is the language of your installed TeamRoute for
          ALL-IN-1 kit.

    4.1 Updating ALL-IN-1 Forms

          When you install TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 for the first time,
          the installation attempts to update the following forms:

          ___________________________________________________________
          Full
          Installation_____Server-only_Installation__________________

          SM$MAIN2         SM$MAIN2

          DEFAULT____________________________________________________

          If any of these forms have been customized, you must add
          the TeamRoute changes manually. The installation procedure
          displays a message to tell you which forms, if any, you
          must update manually. The following sections describe the
          changes necessary for each form.

          Use Customization Management to change the forms. When
          you have finished changing the forms, move them to the
          live area, then precompile and install the affected form
          libraries.

                                  After Installing TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
                                              4.1 Updating ALL-IN-1 Forms


        4.1.1 Updating Form MAIN

              If the installation procedure could not update form MAIN,
              change the form manually. If form MAIN is not appropriate
              for your environment, make the changes on another form (for
              example, on MAIN2).

              Change the form as follows:

              1. Edit the screen image to add the TeamRoute option, as
                 shown:

                 TMR  TeamRoute

              2. After the option name, leave 13 spaces then create a
                 field of 30 characters in length. This is to display the
                 number of new TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 routing packages.

                 Assign the name TMR_COUNT to the new field. Mark the
                 field as Display Only.

              3. Edit the named data on the form to add the following
                 form qualifiers to the .TYPE directive:

                 Also add named data for the TeamRoute option, as
                 follows:

                 ;;OA$_TMR_MO_TEAMROUTE;;

                 FORM TMR$MAIN$MENU

        4.1.2 Updating Form DEFAULT

              If the installation procedure could not update form
              DEFAULT, edit the form to add the following named data
              for the TeamRoute option:

              ;;OA$_TMR_MO_TEAMROUTE;;

              DO TMR$CL_OPEN_LIBRARY\FORM TMR$MAIN$MENU

        4.1.3 Updating Forms SM$MAIN2 and SM_DEFAULT

              If the installation procedure could not update form
              SM$MAIN2, make the following changes:

              1. Edit the screen image to add the Manage TeamRoute system
                 option, as shown:

                 MTS  Manage TeamRoute system

    After Installing TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
    4.1 Updating ALL-IN-1 Forms


          2. Edit the named data on the form to add named data for
             the option, as follows:

             ;;OA$_TMR_MO_MTS;;

             DO TMRA1$LIB:TMR$SM_OPENLIB\FORM TMR$SM$MTS$MENU

          When you move form SM$MAIN2 to the live area, you must also
          move form SM_DEFAULT to the live area. You do not have to
          modify form SM_DEFAULT, but you need to move it to the live
          area because it is referenced by form SM$MAIN2.

    4.2 Upgrading your Customizations

          After an upgrade installation, use Customization Management
          to reapply any customizations that were made to earlier
          versions of TeamRoute elements. If you removed your
          customized elements from the live area before the upgrade
          installation, as described in Section 2.9, the customized
          elements are in the development area. For each of these
          customized elements:

          1. Use Customization Management options to print or read
             details of the differences between the customized
             element and the new base element.

          2. Review the differences between the customized element
             and the new base elements, and decide whether you want
             to reapply your customizations to the new element.

          3. If necessary, reapply your customizations. Depending on
             the relative number of changes that are necessary, you
             can do either of the following:

             o  Apply the changes that have been made to the new base
                element to your customized element

             o  Delete the old customized element and reapply your
                customizations to the new base element

          4. Move the customized element back to the live area, and,
             if necessary, recompile any form libraries or TXLs that
             a message tells you to.

                                  4.3 Checking the Site Startup Procedure


        4.3 Checking the Site Startup Procedure

              After an upgrade installation the site startup procedure,
              A1V32_SITE_START.COM, is in the OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE_IND
              directory. If you have a multilanguage system, the
              language-specific startup procedure OA$SITE_lang_START.COM
              is in the OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_IND directory.

              You may, however, still have a version of the site startup
              procedure in the OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE_ARCH directory on
              the VAX node. This file may contain your own startup
              customizations or startup procedures that have been
              added by other layered products. Similarly, if you
              have a multilanguage system, there may be a version
              of the language-specific startup procedure in the
              OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_ARCH directory on the VAX.

              To ensure that all your startup procedures are in the
              correct site startup file, do the following on the VAX
              node:

              1. Check the contents of the files:

                 OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE_ARCH:A1V32_SITE_START.COM

                 and

                 OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE_IND:A1V32_SITE_START.COM

              2. If there are additional commands in the
                 OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE_ARCH file, add them to the file
                 in OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE_IND

              3. Delete the file OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE_ARCH:A1V32_SITE_
                 START.COM

              4. Check the contents of the files:

                 OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_ARCH:OA$SITE_lang_START.COM

                 and

                 OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_IND:OA$SITE_lang_START.COM

              5. If there are additional commands in the
                 OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_ARCH file, add them to the file in
                 OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_IND

              6. Delete the file OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_ARCH:OA$SITE_lang_
                 START.COM

    4.4 Registering Users as TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Users


    4.4 Registering Users as TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Users

          To use TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1, users must be registered
          in the TeamRoute profile. After installing TeamRoute for
          ALL-IN-1, use options on the Manage TeamRoute Accounts menu
          to add, modify, or delete entries in the TeamRoute profile.
          See Section 5.1 for information about this menu.

          During installation, you can choose to register existing
          ALL-IN-1 users as TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 users. If you
          choose this option and your ALL-IN-1 system has an account
          set up as an Alternate Mail Transport System (AMTS)
          account, you may want to remove it from the TeamRoute
          profile.

    4.5 Checking Licenses

          To be able to send TeamRoute packages, users must be
          covered by a license for TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1.

          If you use personal use licensing, make sure that all users
          of TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 are registered with LMF. You do
          not have to register the ALL-IN-1 manager's account with
          LMF.

    4.6 Supporting TeamLinks Users

          To enable users on your system to access TeamRoute for
          ALL-IN-1 from a TeamLinks client, you must:

          o  Ensure that the Mail destination of these users is not
             TMR (see Section 5.4).

          o  Ensure that the Service Agent drawer is an ADVANCED
             SHARED drawer. This is necessary to allow users of
             TeamLinks clients access to TeamRoute masters. If this
             drawer is not already an ADVANCED SHARED drawer, change
             it as follows:

             1. Use the Manage TeamRoute system (MTS) option on the
                ALL-IN-1 Management menu to display the TeamRoute
                System Management menu.

             2. Use the Manage Service Agents option to display the
                Manage Service Agents menu.

             3. Use the Stop Service Agent (SP) option to stop the
                Service Agent.

                 4. Use the Manage file cabinets (MFC) option on the
                    ALL-IN-1 Management menu to display the Manage File
                    Cabinets menu.

                 5. Use the Manage Drawers (MD) option to go to the
                    Manage Drawers menu. Select the Service Agent
                    account's default drawer. On an English language
                    system, the default name for this drawer is
                    [TMRA1SA1]MAIN.

                 6. Use the Modify drawer type (MDT) option, and in the
                    Drawer type field, enter ADVANCED SHARED.

                 7. The Share Drawer form is displayed. Give READ access
                    to group *WORLD.

                 8. The Set Default Access for Documents form is
                    displayed. Press RETURN to leave the form without
                    changing it.

                 9. ALL-IN-1 displays the following question:

                    Apply same access to existing documents in this drawer? [Y/N]

                    Enter N.

                 10.Go back to the Manage Service Agents menu and use
                    the Start Service Agent (ST) option to restart the
                    Service Agent.

                                 Managing TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Services


              This chapter explains how to manage TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
              services. Options to manage TeamRoute are available on the
              TeamRoute System Management menu. To get to this menu, use
              the Manage TeamRoute system (MTS) option on the ALL-IN-1
              Management menu.

              If you installed TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 as a server-
              only installation on a multilanguage system, TeamRoute
              management options are available only from the primary
              (default) language of your system.

        5.1 Managing TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Accounts

              During installation, you can choose to register all
              ALL-IN-1 users as TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 users. After
              installation, you can register individual ALL-IN-1 users
              as TeamRoute users by creating an entry for each user in
              the TeamRoute profile file.

              A profile record consists of the following fields:

              o  ALL-IN-1 account name

              o  Date the entry for the subscriber was created

              o  Date the entry was last modified

              o  Enabled flag

              To create or modify profile records, select the Manage
              Accounts (MAC) option from the TeamRoute System Management
              menu. TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 displays the Manage TeamRoute
              User Accounts menu, as shown in Figure 5-1.

                     suspends, its status is updated to SUSPENDED. This
                     command causes the service agent to exit ALL-IN-1,
                     but remain in a detached process. Requests can
                     be sent to the Service Agent, but they are not

              RE     Resumes the Service Agent and changes its status
                     to RUN PENDING. When the Service Agent actually
                     resumes, the status is updated to RUNNING. The
                     Service Agent logs back in to the ALL-IN-1 account
                     and continues to process requests.

              SP     Stops the Service Agent and changes its status to
                     STOP PENDING. When the Service Agent actually stops,
                     its status is updated to STOPPED.

              SW     Displays the current values in the Service Agent
                     Control file so that you can edit the wait interval
                     (see Section 5.2.2).

              SR     Displays the current values in the Service Agent
                     Control file so that you can set the rollover value
                     (in blocks) for the transaction file. The default
                     value is 600 blocks.

          Option_Description_________________________________________

          SLF    Closes the current log file and renames it and
                 all log files with the same name to TMRA1$SA_
                 LOG:TMRA1SA1.LOG_timestamp.

                 The value for timestamp is the time stamp for the
                 file, in NBS format. More than one log file with the
                 name TMRA1SA1.LOG can exist if a new log file was
                 started due to conflicting access. A conflict can
                 occur if the log file is read through ALL-IN-1 and
                 an ALL-IN-1 script attempts to write to the log file
                 at the same time. In this situation, a new log file
                 is created.

                 A conflict also can occur if the log file is
                 accessed by the Service Agent. The Service Agent
                 attempts to access the log file five times, pausing
                 five minutes between attempts. If the log file
                 cannot be accessed after five attempts, a new log
                 file is created.

          STF    Closes the current transaction file and renames
                 it and all transaction files with the same name to
                 TMRA1$SA_DATA:TMR$SA_TRANSACTION.DAT_timestamp.

                 The value for timestamp is the time stamp for the
                 file, in NBS format. More than one transaction file
                 with the name TMR$SA_TRANSACTION.DAT can exist if a
                 new transaction file was started due to conflicting
                 access. A conflict can occur if the transaction
                 file is read through ALL-IN-1 and an ALL-IN-1 script
                 attempts to write to the transaction file at the
                 same time. In this situation, a new transaction file
          _______is_created._________________________________________

    5.2.1 Service Agent Account Requirements

          The Service Agent OpenVMS account, TMRA1SERVICE, must have
          unrestricted access to DCL, so that it can run command
          procedures. Therefore, the account must not have a /FLAGS
          option that restricts access to DCL. One example of such an
          option is CAPTIVE.

                                           5.2 Managing the Service Agent


              If the Service Agent OpenVMS account has a /FLAGS option
              of RESTRICTED, the account must have a LOGIN.COM file in
              its top-level directory, TMRA1$SADEVICE:[TMRA1SERVICE]. The
              file can be empty.

              To check the flags set for the Service Agent account, run
              the AUTHORIZE Utility and enter the following command:

              UAF> SHOW TMRA1SERVICE

        5.2.2 Setting the Wait Interval

              The Service Agent is a detached process that does not
              require a batch queue; therefore, it does not need to
              resubmit itself to run periodically. Instead, it hibernates
              for a defined period of time when no requests are present.
              The default wait interval is five minutes.

              Additionally, when the Service Agent is suspended, it uses
              the wait interval to intermittently check for a changed
              status.

              You can reset the wait interval using the Set wait interval
              (SW) option. The wait interval has the form HH:MM:SS.

        5.2.3 Using the Service Agent Log File

              The Service Agent maintains a log file, TMRA1$SA_
              LOG:account.LOG

              account is the name of the Service Agent account.

              The log file contains:

              o  The times when the Service Agent is submitted, stopped,
                 suspended, and started

              o  Diagnostic messages

              Use the Read log file (RL) option, or the DCL TYPE command,
              to read the log file.

              The log file can grow large from successive executions. Use
              the Switch log file (SLF) option to start a new one. You
              then can copy the old file to another directory, or delete
              it.

    5.2 Managing the Service Agent


    5.2.4 Using the Service Agent Transaction File

          The Service Agent maintains a transaction file, TMRA1$SA_
          DATA:TMR$SA_TRANSACTION.DAT. This contains information
          about the Service Agent's routine processing.

          Use the Read transaction file (RT) option, or the DCL TYPE
          command to read the transaction file.

          The transaction file can grow large from successive
          executions. Use the Switch transaction file (STF) option to
          start a new one. You then can copy the old file to another
          directory, or delete it.

          The Service Agent automatically rolls over the transaction
          file based on the value you specify using the Set rollover
          value (SR) option on the Manage Service Agents menu.

          Records in a transaction file are formatted as a series of
          fields, some of fixed length and some of variable length.
          All fields are separated by a comma (,). The following
          example shows typical transaction records.

          See Appendix C for more information on the transaction
          file.

    5.2.5 Tracing Service Agent Activity

          If an error occurs repeatedly, it can be helpful to trace
          the activity of the Service Agent. Do this as follows:

          1. Use the Stop Service Agent (SP) option to stop the
             Service Agent.

          2. At the DCL level, enter the following command:

             $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC TMRA1$SATRACE "1"

          3. Use the Start Service Agent (ST) option to start the
             Service Agent.

          This starts the ALL-IN-1 tracing process. The trace file is
          located in the file TMRA1$A1:A1TRACE.LOG.

                                           5.2 Managing the Service Agent


              It is important to turn off tracing after processing,
              because the trace file will become very large. To turn
              tracing off, follow these steps:

              1. Use the Stop Service Agent (SP) option to stop the
                 Service Agent.

              2. At the DCL level, enter the following command:

                 $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC TMRA1$SATRACE "0"

              3. Use the Start Service Agent (ST) option to start the
                 Service Agent.

              You cannot access the trace file until the Service Agent
              has been stopped. You may want to delete old trace files to
              conserve disk space.

        5.2.6 Testing and Repairing Mail Areas

              When you run the ALL-IN-1 Test and Repair Mail Areas (TRM)
              procedure, you must first suspend or stop the TeamRoute
              Service Agent. This is because the TRM procedure requires
              all ALL-IN-1 users to be logged out of ALL-IN-1. The
              TeamRoute Service Agent runs within its ALL-IN-1 account,
              so it must be suspended or stopped while the TRM procedure
              is running.

              Use the Suspend Service Agent (SU) option or the Stop
              Service Agent (SP) option before you run the TRM
              housekeeping procedure. When the housekeeping procedure
              has completed, use the Resume Service Agent (RE) option or
              the Start Service Agent (ST) option.

        5.3 Managing the Application Registration File

              The registration file determines which applications are
              available on the system for use by TeamRoute routing
              packages. It consists of a set of records, one record for
              each application. Each record has three fields:

              o  Application name

              o  Script file specification

              o  One-line description (up to 60 alphanumeric characters)

              To register new applications or modify existing ones,
              select the Manage application registration (MAR) option
              from the TeamRoute System Management menu.

        5.4 Setting the Mail Destination of TeamRoute Users

              For any users on your system who plan to use TeamRoute
              from a TeamLinks client, the Mail destination field in
              the ALL-IN-1 profile must be set to ALL-IN-1. However, for
              users who plan to use TeamRoute from a VT or by terminal
              emulation only, the Mail destination field can be set to
              either TMR or ALL-IN-1.

              The differences between the TMR and ALL-IN-1 Mail
              destination settings are as follows:

              o  With a Mail destination of TMR:

                 -  Incoming TeamRoute packages are automatically
                    received in the user's TMR INBOX folder.

    Managing TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 Services
    5.4 Setting the Mail Destination of TeamRoute Users


             -  The user does not receive mail sent to the
                SUBSCRIBERS: special address. To ensure that users
                with a Mail destination of TMR receive mail that is
                intended for all ALL-IN-1 users, maintain the system
                distribution list, @TMR_SUBSCRIBERS (see Table 5-1),
                and ask users to use this distribution list instead
                of the SUBSCRIBERS: special address.

          o  With a Mail destination of ALL-IN-1:

             -  Incoming TeamRoute packages arrive in the user's
                INBOX folder. The packages are transferred to the TMR
                INBOX folder when the user tries to read them from
                the Electronic Messaging subsystem or when the user
                uses the Index - Inbox (II) option from the TeamRoute
                subsystem.

             -  The user receives mail sent to the SUBSCRIBERS:
                special address.

          To change a user's mail destination, use the Edit (E)
          option on the Maintain User Accounts menu.

    5.5 Troubleshooting: Routing Packages not Sent

          If a user cannot send a routing package, check that the
          user is covered by a license for TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1.

          When a user who is not covered by a license tries to send a
          routing package, ALL-IN-1 displays a message:

          You are not registered with LMF, you cannot send new masters

    5.6 Troubleshooting: Routing Packages not Received

          If there are TeamRoute routing packages that have been
          sent, but have not been received, check the following areas
          to determine the problem:

          1. Find out if the Service Agent process is running. Enter
             the following DCL command to list all processes on your
             system:

             $ SHOW SYSTEM/OUT=LIST.TXT

                       5.6 Troubleshooting: Routing Packages not Received


                 Search the output file to see if the Service Agent
                 process exists:

                 $ SEARCH LIST.TXT "TMRA1$SA_1"

                 If the process exists, process information similar to
                 the following is displayed:

                 0000208D TMRA1$SA_1 COM 3 4454662 2 08:52:03.25 1519701 848

                 If the process information is not present, the Service
                 Agent process does not exist.

              2. Access the Manage Service Agents menu. If the Service
                 Agent process does not exist, or if the status shown in
                 the current item block is STOPPED, use the ST option to
                 start the Service Agent.

              3. Check that the ALL-IN-1 Sender and Fetcher are working
                 correctly.

              4. Use the following command to see if the logical
                 TMRA1$SABATCH is assigned to an existing batch queue:

                 $ SHOW LOGICAL TMRA1$SABATCH

                 If there is no batch queue for TMRA1$SABATCH, create
                 one, or reassign TMRA1$SABATCH to an existing batch
                 queue.

              o  Warning

              o  Error

        B.1 Informational Messages

              The following informational messages are part of the normal
              execution of the Service Agent within the DCL command
              procedure. They require no action.

              All informational messages begin with %TMRA1$SA-I-.

         RUNREQUEST,  SA has received a run request

            Explanation: The Service Agent has received an execution or
            start request. Its status is RUNNING.

    B.2 Warning and Error Messages


    B.2 Warning and Error Messages

          The following sections list error condition messages that
          are part of the execution of the Service Agent in the
          ALL-IN-1 command procedure. Error conditions do not stop
          the Service Agent, but they can prevent the Service Agent
          from processing a particular request or routing package.

    B.2.1 Warning Messages

          The following warning messages normally do not represent
          conditions that prevent the Service Agent from processing
          the current routing package. Most require no action.

          All warning messages begin with %TMRA1$SA-W-.

      ACCOUNTNOTAVAIL, SA has determined that SA Account is not
         available:
         account

         Explanation: The Service Agent has checked for the Service
         Agent
         ALL-IN-1 account and found it is not available. The Service
         Agent cannot log in to ALL-IN-1 if the account is not
         available. The Service Agent process will exit and the
         process will stop. No processing can be done until the
         situation is corrected.

         Action: Check to see if the Service Agent ALL-IN-1 account
         exists.

      BYPASSERROR_NOMASTER, SA cannot bypass a recipient, cannot
         locate master routing package:
         folder/docnum

         Explanation: The Service Agent could not locate a master
         routing package during a bypass request. The routing package
         may have been previously deleted. No action is required.

      CONTROLFILE_ERROR, SA cannot update the control file.

         Explanation: The Service Agent was not able to update the
         control file. It is possible that it was being accessed by
         system management. No correction is necessary.

                                           B.2 Warning and Error Messages


         DELETEERROR_NOMASTER,  SA cannot delete a master, routing
            package not found:
            folder/docnum

            Explanation: The Service Agent could not locate a master
            routing package during a delete request. The routing package
            may have been previously deleted. You do not need to correct
            this error.

         ERROR_MASTER_TERM,  SA received a bypass request on a completed
            master routing package:
            folder/docnum

            Explanation: The Service Agent has received a request from
            an initiator to bypass a recipient. The target master
            routing package has already been completed. No action can
            be taken on this request.

         NONDELIVERY,  SA received a non-delivery message, service
            message sent to:
            user

            Explanation: The Service Agent received a nondelivery
            message with a TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 routing package
            attached. The failed delivery could either be a Tracking
            Copy, a Routing Copy or an unexpected TeamRoute for ALL-
            IN-1 type. This could have been the result of sending a
            routing copy to a recipient who is not a TeamRoute for ALL-
            IN-1 subscriber. A service message has been sent to the
            subscriber. No action is required; however, you may want to
            determine why a TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 routing package could
            not be delivered to the subscriber.

         NOTALLOWED,  SA found a request for function not allowed on a
            completed routing package:
            folder/docnum/function

            Explanation: Requested function is not allowed on a
            completed TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 master. No correction is
            necessary.

         NOTAVAILABLE,  SA has determined that ALL-IN-1 is not available.

            Explanation: The Service Agent has checked for ALL-IN-1 and
            found it is not running. The Service Agent cannot log in to
            ALL-IN-1 if it is not running. The Service Agent process
            waits for the set wait time and will attempt to access
            ALL-IN-1 again.

    Handling Diagnostics
    B.2 Warning and Error Messages


      SERVICENONDELIVERY, A service message was returned as a
         nondelivery message.

         Explanation: A service message was returned to the Service
         Agent as a nondelivery message. In practice, this would
         occur only if the initiator or recipient of a routing
         package are not able to receive TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
         routing packages. Check that the intended recipient of the
         service message has a valid, enabled TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
         account. No further service messages will be sent to that
         address.

      TMRUNKNOWN, SA received unexpected TMR request; type :
         TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 routing package type

         Explanation: The Service Agent received a TeamRoute for ALL-
         IN-1 routing package of unknown type. No action is required.

      TRACKMASTERERROR, SA cannot select a master routing package
         while creating a tracking report:
         folder/docnum

         Explanation: The Service Agent cannot locate a master
         routing package. It is possible that the master routing
         package has already been deleted. A tracking report will not
         be made.

      UPDATE_BYPASSED, SA cannot apply update, recipient was
         bypassed:
         user

         Explanation: A routing package update was received by the
         Service Agent, but the sender was bypassed on the routing
         list. The update will not be applied to the master routing
         package. Routing will continue and no corrections are
         necessary.

      UPDATE_NOTCURRENT, SA cannot apply update, user not current
         recipient:
         user

         Explanation: An update was received by the Service Agent,
         but the sender is not the current recipient. This occurs
         when the recipient has been bypassed or deleted on the
         routing list. The update will not be applied to the master
         routing package. Routing will continue and no corrections
         are necessary.

                                           B.2 Warning and Error Messages


         UNKNOWNLOW,  SA found an unknown or invalid type low-priority
            request:
            type/state

            Explanation: The Service Agent received a request which has
            an unknown type. This occurs when non-TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
            routing packages or regular mail messages are sent to the
            Service Agent.

            You generally do not have to correct this problem. The TMR_
            UNKNOWN_LOW folder will contain all unknown requests that
            are mailed to the Service Agent. You may want to review and
            purge these messages periodically.

        B.2.2 Error Messages

              The following messages represent error conditions that can
              prevent a Service Agent from processing the current routing
              package or request.

              All error messages begin with %TMRA1$SA-E-.

         ATTACHERROR,  SA error separating attachments; none found in:
            folder/docnum

            Explanation: The TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 routing package
            indicated there were attachments, but none were found. A
            service message was sent to the initiator of the routing
            package.

            Action: It is possible that the routing package initiator
            deleted the attachments outside the TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1
            subsystem. If this is not the case, submit an SPR.

         BYPASSMASTER,  SA is bypassing new master routing package:
            folder/master_docnum

            Explanation: A possible TeamRoute master routing package
            was sent to the Service Agent but it could not be processed.
            This error occurs when the routing package files cannot be
            opened by the TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 subsystem, because the
            document is not a TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 routing package.
            The initiator has already received notification that this
            document could not be processed. No action is required.

      DATAERROR, SA has found an error separating data files; none
         found in :
         folder/docnum/type

         Explanation: The TeamRoute routing package indicated there
         were data files, but none were found. A service message was
         sent to the sender of the routing package.

         Action: It is possible that the initiator of the routing
         package detached the data files outside the TeamRoute for
         ALL-IN-1 subsystem. If this is not the case, submit an SPR.
         Otherwise, no action is required.

         Explanation: The Service Agent attempted to set ACLs on the
         master or the attachments but could not read the initiator's
         profile. The ACLs could not be set.

         Action: Check the profile for the Service Agent initiator,
         and correct the profile problem.

      PROFILEEMPTY, SA could not find the profile entry for SA:
         sa_name

         Explanation: The Service Agent attempted to set ACLs on the
         master or the attachments but could not read the Service
         Agent's profile. The ACLs could not be set.

         Action: Check the profile for the Service Agent, and correct
         the profile problem.

      TRACKING, SA is unable to create a tracking report, master
         routing package was deleted:
         requester/docnum

         Explanation: The Service Agent is unable to create a
         tracking report. The master routing package was previously
         deleted.

              This appendix provides an overview of the transaction file
              and detailed descriptions of its record format.

        C.1 Overview

              The transaction file is an ASCII sequential file, with
              variable-length records, produced by the TeamRoute for ALL-
              IN-1 Service Agent. A record is written to this file for
              each transaction that the Service Agent performs. Table C-1
              shows the transaction types.

    Transaction File
    C.2 Record Format


    C.2 Record Format

          Each record in the transaction log file has two parts; a
          fixed-length part and a variable-length part. The fixed-
          length part of the record is common to all transaction
          types listed above, while the variable-length part differs
          according to the type of transaction being recorded.

          All fields in each transaction log record contain ASCII
          data. This allows you to view the file using simple
          mechanisms such as the DCL TYPE command. Where possible,
          field data has been abbreviated to conserve space. For
          example, the transaction type field is recorded as a two-
          character mnemonic (see Section C.1). Each transaction type
          can have different fields recorded in the variable-length
          part of the record. All fields form a comma-separated list.

    C.2.1 Fixed-Length Fields

          Table C-2 lists the fixed-length fields of a transaction
          log record. Each field is separated by a comma (,). If
          a field is unavailable, the field size is filled with
          spaces.

          Table_C-2_Transaction_File_Fixed-Length_Fields_____________

          Field_________Size___Description___________________________

          TIMESTAMP     14     A timestamp representing the
                               date and time when the record was
                               created. This field is in the format:
                               YYYYMMDDHHSSCC.

          TRANS_ID      2      A mnemonic describing the type of
                               transaction record that follows (see
                               Table C-1).

          USER_ID       12     An identifier for the subscriber
                               that owns the master copy document
                               for which this transaction is being
                               recorded. The source of this field
                               is the ALL-IN-1 full name, which is
                               truncated to 12 characters.

        C.2.2 Variable-Length Fields

              Table C-3 lists the variable-length fields of a transaction
              log record by transaction code. Each field is separated by
              a comma (,). If a field is unavailable, a comma is used as
