              systems. These services include the possibility of
              responding to or generating asynchronous plant occurrences
              (Events), connecting to industrial automation devices,
              and distributing device data and information plantwide.
              In BASEstar Open, these services are provided by specific
              processes (BASEstar Open servers) such as the following:

              o  Event Services server

              o  Data & Device Services server

              o  Application Management Services server

              o  Packet Services server

              There are several ways in which user applications can
              access these services:

              o  C language programs, which use the BASEstar Open
                 Application Program Interface (API)

              o  BASEstar Open's Command Line Interface (CLI)

              o  BASEstar Open's high level language, CIMFAST

              From a purely BASEstar Open architectural point of view,
              these user applications can be considered clients of the
              requested BASEstar Open service provider (server). This
              client/server relationship exists regardless of whether
              the application resides on the same physical node as the
              server or on a different BASEstar Open network node. In
              fact, from a functionality point of view, the location of
              the requested BASEstar Open server has no impact on the
              application.

                                                                      1-1

 



    BASEstar Open's Client-Server Architecture
    1.1 BASEstar Open Servers and Clients


          However, the application may be impacted in other ways
          depending on whether its node is a BASEstar Open Server
          node or a BASEstar Open Client node, for example in
          the level of system management support available. This
          consideration is fundamental to an analysis of the
          different roles of BASEstar Open Server nodes and Client
          nodes, as outlined in Section 1.1.1.

    1.1.1 Roles of BASEstar Open Servers and Clients

          Server nodes represent the robust computing engine for
          industrial automation applications where plant data
          is collected, managed and made available throughout
          the network. On these nodes, which may be dual host to
          maximise reliability, you can activate and manage mission-
          critical applications under the control of BASEstar Open's
          Application Management Services (AMS). (AMS provides
          system management services for monitoring the status
          of applications and managing their orderly startup and
          shutdown). These server nodes also manage the connections
          to automation devices such as PLCs or Numeric Controllers.
          This environment may be part of the controlled computer
          room environment with all the procedures necessary for
          starting up applications and their recovery in the event of
          a failure.

          Client nodes, on the other hand, provide a less
          sophisticated, easier to use, "plug & play" environment
          for any application anywhere in the network which needs
          to access the services provided by BASEstar Open. For
          example, it is common practice to use PC-based and
          workstation client nodes as visualization stations
          distributed throughout the enterprise for providing up-to-
          date graphical or reporting information regarding the state
          of the plant, production status, etc. This type of node is
          often the typical desktop environment, with its suite of
          personal productivity tools and mail system, which, with
          the incorporation of the BASEstar Open Client software,
          becomes a viewing/reporting station providing real-time
          plant information.

          From a system management point of view, client nodes
          also provide several advantages with respect to a server
          nodes. It is easier to set them up and "plug them in" to a
          BASEstar Open network.

                                    1.1 BASEstar Open Servers and Clients


        1.1.2 Configuration Differences

              BASEstar Open configuration is the process by which
              BASEstar Open objects are described and defined. These
              objects like Data_Points, Devices, BASEstar Open services
              etc., once defined become part of one or more Realms
              and are physically located on one or more BASEstar Open
              Server Nodes. BASEstar Open Client nodes instead do not
              physically contain any BASEstar Open objects so are not
              part of a Realm but do provide access to Realms in support
              of BASEstar Open Client-based applications.

              Even though the BASEstar Open Client nodes are not impacted
              (modified), by the BASEstar Open configuration process the
              PC-based BASEstar Open Client can have an important role
              in this process. In fact, the PC-based client is often used
              as a configuration station on those PCs where the BASEstar
              Open Graphic Configuration utility is installed.

        1.1.3 Product Differences

              All BASEstar Open services, including Event management,
              data Management and device management, are part of the
              BASEstar Open Server product. This product comes in two
              flavours: Development and Runtime.

              With a development license, you can link compiled C
              language programs which make calls to the BASEstar Open
              API against the BASEstar Open Runtime Library. You can then
              deploy these applications on server or client nodes. The
              Runtime License does not allow you to develop programs, but
              permits all developed applications to be deployed on the
              BASEstar Open Runtime Server product which includes all the
              BASEstar Open services.

              The BASEstar Open Client product does not offer the
              BASEstar Open services directly, but provides a means for
              BASEstar Open applications to obtain transparent access to
              these services, which are located on servers anywhere in
              the network. BASEstar Open has its own communication system
              for allowing client applications, regardless of where they
              are located, to access BASEstar Open services.



                                                                      1-3

 



    BASEstar Open's Client-Server Architecture
    1.1 BASEstar Open Servers and Clients


          As a general indication, it is possible to summarise
          the differences between the BASEstar Open Server and the
          BASEstar Open Client product as follows:

          o  BASEstar Open Server only

             -  Device connection

             -  Repository for BASEstar Open objects (Data_Points,
                Events etc.)

             -  Application management via Application Management
                Services (AMS)

             -  Trace troubleshooting facility

             -  Execution of invoked BASEstar Open services

          o  Available on both BASEstar Open Server and BASEstar Open
             Client

             -  Ability to access BASEstar Open services

          PC-based clients and servers support some features which
          are specific to the PC environment. These include:

          o  A graphic configuration tool for configuring BASEstar
             Open objects

          o  DDE bridge for communicating with DDE-compliant PC
             applications.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             The discussion in this chapter is of a generic nature;
             its aim is to clarify the conceptual differences
             between BASEstar Open Server nodes and BASEstar Open
             Client nodes. The availability of a given feature
             on a specific BASEstar Open platform depends on the
             released version of the product. For information
             regarding specific functionalities, consult the
             detailed product documentation (SPD, release notes).

    2.6 Pre-requisite Licenses


    2.6 Pre-requisite Licenses

          BASEstar Open Client Version 3.2 does not need any kind
          of registration, so you do NOT have to register a License
          Product Authorization Key (License PAK) using the License
          Management Facility (LMF). The registration must be
          performed on BASEstar Open Server Version 3.2. Refer to
          BASEstar Open Server and Client Release Notes for further
          details of the licenses available.

          If you are installing pre-requisite or optional software
          along with BASEstar Open Client, review the PAK status and
          install the PAKs for any pre-requisite or optional software
          before you install BASEstar Open Client.

    2.7 Backing Up Your System Disk

          At the beginning of the installation, the procedure asks if
          you have backed up your system disk. COMPAQ recommends that
          you do a system disk backup before installing any software.
          If a system failure occurs at a critical point during the
          installation, some of the files could be corrupted. For
          further information about backing up your system disk,
          refer to the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS
          System Manager's Manual.

          In addition, make sure that the VMS Help library is
          not used during the course of the BASEstar Open Client
          installation.

    2.8 Preparing Your System

          This section outlines the necessary disk space, privileges,
          and parameter values that are required for installing
          BASEstar Open Client for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX).

          VMSINSTAL checks for the required values and reports any
          errors before deciding if to fail.

    2.8.1 Account Privileges

          To install BASEstar Open Client, you must be logged in
          to the system management account SYSTEM, and have ALL
          privileges set. Note that the installation procedure,
          VMSINSTAL, disactivates the BYPASS privilege at the start
          of the installation.

        2.8.2 Disk Space Requirements

              To install BASEstar Open Client, there must be at least
              10,000 blocks of free disk space (peak block count) on the
              system disk. Once you have installed BASEstar Open Client,
              the BASEstar Open Client environment requires 9,000 blocks
              of free disk space.

              To determine the number of free disk blocks, enter the
              following command at the DCL prompt:

              $ SHOW DEVICE device_name

              where device_name refers to the device on which you intend
              to install BASEstar Open Client for OpenVMS.

        2.8.3 Account Quotas for Installation

              The account from which BASEstar Open Client is installed
              must have certain minimum quotas. Before attempting to
              install BASEstar Open Client, verify that the account has
              the correct quotas.

              Table 2-3 summarizes the minimum quotas required for the
              installation of BASEstar Open Client on OpenVMS Alpha and
              OpenVMS VAX.

          If no changes are necessary, enter the EXIT command to
          leave the Authorize utility.

          To modify system account quotas (for example, BYTLM), use
          the following command line:

          UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM/BYTLM=32768

          The utility responds with a message confirming the change.
          You can then enter the EXIT command to exit from the

        2.8.4 OpenVMS SYSGEN Parameters and Minimum Values

              In order to install BASEstar Open Client successfully, you
              must set a series of System Generation Utility (SYSGEN)
              parameters before attempting the installation. Table 2-4
              and lists the minimum required values for the system
              parameters.

              To install and run BASEstar Open Client, you must have
              sufficient free global pages and global sections. You must
              first determine how many free global pages and sections
              you have on your system. Then use AUTOGEN if you need to
              increase the values of the GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS system
              parameters.

              Table 2-4 Minimum Required System Parameter Values -

              the minimum number of free global pages and global sections
              required to run BASEstar Open Client in addition to the
              requirements of your current system and other software.
              These values are not the total number you need to run your
              system and other software.
              ___________________________________________________________

              Checking System Parameter Values

              To check the values of your system parameters, use either
              of the following methods:

              o  For the number of remaining free pages and free sections

                 Use the DCL lexical F$GETSYI with a system parameter
                 item (for example, FREE_GBLPAGES and FREE_GBLSECTS) as
                 follows:

                 $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")
                 5680
                 $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")
                 128

                                                                      2-7

    2.8 Preparing Your System


             If the values for the free global pages or global
             sections displayed by the system are greater than the
             values in Table 2-4, you do not need to increase them.
             If the values are lower, you must increase the system
             parameter settings.

          o  For the static number of free pages and free sections

             Invoke the System Generation Utility (SYSGEN):

             $
             RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
             SYSGEN>

             At the SYSGEN> prompt, enter the SHOW command to
             display the value of a system parameter. The values
             displayed should equal or exceed the value of each
             system parameter listed in Table 2-4. The following
             example displays the value for the GBLPAGES system
             parameter:

             SYSGEN>
             SHOW GBLPAGES

             After checking the parameters with the SHOW command,
             enter the EXIT command at the SYSGEN> prompt to return
             to DCL level.

                     Installing BASEstar Open Client on an OpenVMS System





        3.1 Installation Procedure

              Before you begin installing BASEstar Open Client, make
              sure that your system meets the requirements outlined in
              Chapter 2 and that you have completed all the tasks listed
              in Table 2-1.

              The BASEstar Open Client installation procedure consists of
              a series of questions and informational messages. To abort
              the installation procedure at any time, press <Ctrl>/<Y>.
              If you press <Ctrl>/<Y>, the installation procedure deletes
              all files it has created up to that point and exits. You
              can then start the installation again.

              The approximate time required for the full installation of
              BASEstar Open is as follows:

              o  1 to 3 minutes, for OpenVMS Alpha

              o  1 to 5 minutes, for OpenVMS VAX

              However, the exact time depends largely on the type of
              media you are using and your system configuration.

        3.2 VMSINSTAL Checks

              When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks whether:

              o  You have set your default device and directory to
                 SYS$UPDATE

              o  You are logged in to the system management account
                 SYSTEM

              o  DECnet is running

              o  Any users are logged in to the system

                                                                      3-1

 



    Installing BASEstar Open Client on an OpenVMS System
    3.2 VMSINSTAL Checks


          If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
          it notifies you and asks if you want to continue the
          installation. In some instances, you can enter YES to
          continue. To stop the installation process and correct
          the situation, enter NO or press <Return>. Then correct the
          problem and restart the installation.

    3.3 Installation Steps

          The following steps describe how to install BASEstar Open
          on OpenVMS Alpha:

          1. Start the installation

             To start the installation, invoke the
             SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL.COM procedure from a privileged
             account (for example, SYSTEM). Use the kit name
             BSTROCVA032 (for OpenVMS Alpha) or BSTROCVV032 (for
             OpenVMS VAX) as the first parameter to the command
             VMSINSTAL. Use the device or directory on which the
             installation kit is located as the second parameter.

             For example, if the media containing the BASEstar Open
             Client software is on device mua0, then you must issue
             the following command to install BASEstar Open Client:

             $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL BSTROCVA032 MUA0:

                     OpenVMS AXP Software Product Installation Procedure V7.1

             It is 13-MAY-1998 at 14:05.

             Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

             If you do not supply either the product name or the
             device name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information
             later in the installation procedure.

          2. Confirm system backup

               * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

             VMSINSTAL asks if you are satisfied with your system
             backup. You should always back up your system disk
             before performing an installation. If you are satisfied
             with the backup of your system disk, press Return.
             Otherwise, enter NO to discontinue the installation.

              4. Installing on target disk

                 VMSINSTAL asks you where you would like to have BASEstar
                 Open installed. If your system is a VAXcluster and you
                 would like to have BASEstar Open available on all or a
                 set of nodes in the cluster you must install BASEstar
                 Open on a disk that is visible to those nodes in the
                 cluster.

                                                                      3-3

                 number of informational messages that report on the
                 progress of the installation.

              8. Creating Files

                 If the installation procedure has been successful up to
                 this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new or modified files
                 to their target directories, updates help files, and
                 updates DCL tables, if necessary.

                 The following messages are displayed:

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target
                                                    directories...

              9. Running BASEstar Open IVP

                 At this point, BASEstar Open verifies that:

                 -  A valid license for BASEstar Open has been installed

                 -  The installation procedure has been successful

                 -  You have responded yes during installation of
                    BASEstar Open to the question about running the IVP.

                 If all the above requirements are met, it runs the

          For an example of a complete log of an installation, refer
          to Appendix A .

    3.4 Error Recovery

          If errors occur during the installation, VMSINSTAL displays
          failure messages. If the installation itself fails, you see
          the following message:

          %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of BSTROCVA032 V3.2
          has failed.

          Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
          following conditions exist:

          o  The operating system version is incorrect.

          o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

          o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
             insufficient.

          o  System parameter values for successful installation are
             insufficient.

          o  The OpenVMS Help library is currently in use.

          For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
          conditions, see the OpenVMS documentation on system
          messages, recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software
          installation. If you are notified that any of these
          conditions exist, you should take the appropriate action as
          described in the message. For information on installation
          requirements, see Chapter 2.

          If GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS are insufficient, the
          installation continues but displays warning messages that
          BASEstar Open may fail during the IVP or during runtime.

        Configuring and Managing BASEstar Open Client on a OpenVMS System


              This chapter describes the operations that you have to
              perform after installing BASEstar Open Client on a OpenVMS
              system, in order to ensure that it is ready for use.

        5.1 Setting Up and Starting the BASEstar Open Client Environment

              After installing BASEstar Open Client, you must execute
              a series of procedures to configure and start/stop the
              product:

              o  bstr_node_setup

                 When you execute this procedure, BASEstar Open Client
                 creates the file directories and data files that store
                 in a permanent way the configuration attributes; among
                 the permanent data, there are the node names to be
                 contacted to set up a connection with the BASEstar Open
                 realms to be accessed.

              o  bstr_node_start

                 When you execute this procedure, BASEstar Open Client
                 starts the watchdog process and the log process.

                 The watchdog process manages the connections between the
                 BASEstar Open Client applications and the server sides.
                 The log process records the basic operations and the
                 failures reported by the watchdog process and BASEstar
                 Open applications.

              o  bstr_node_shut

                 When you execute this procedure, BASEstar Open Client
                 stops the watchdog and log processes.

              o  bstr_node_unset

                 When you execute this procedure, BASEstar Open Client
                 deletes the data files and directories created by bstr_
                 node_setup.

                                                                      5-1

 



    Configuring and Managing BASEstar Open Client on a OpenVMS System
    5.1 Setting Up and Starting the BASEstar Open Client Environment


    5.1.1 Configuring the BASEstar Open Client Environment

          The DCL procedure BSTR_NODE_SETUP is stored in the ETC
          directory of the directory where BASEstar Open Client was
          installed. It must be run with at least the specification
          of the installation directory.

          It prompts the user by requesting the location of the work
          directory where it will create the file directories and
          data files for the configuration), and the name(s) of the
          nodes to be contacted for BASEstar Open Servers.

          o  Run the procedure by specifying the location of the
             installation kit.

             $  @DKA200:[BSTRCLT.ETC]BSTR_NODE_SETUP -L DKA200:[BSTRCLT] [-V]

          o  The procedure prompts for the name of the work directory
             it is going to create.

                Name of the work directory. You must introduce the path name (according to
                the rules of VAX/VMS - .e.g. "DISK:[SUBD1.SUBD2]" )
                of an UNEXISTING directory :

                BSTR.Spool_Work_Dir:  []

          o  At the above request, you must enter the name of the
             BASEstar Open work root. Type the pathname of the
             directory where you want BASEstar Open Client to keep
             its run-time work tree:

             BSTR.Spool_Work_Dir:  []   DKA200:[BSTRCLT.WORK]

          o  You may decide to abort the set-up procedure; the
             procedures creates the configuration directories.

             If you are not satisfied with the settings of installation parameters
             you can terminate the procedure and run it again:

              o  To configure BASEstar Open Client you must specify at
                 least one name of a host where BASEstar Open Server is
                 (or will be) installed. The LNS server(s) of the host(s)
                 you specify will be contacted sequentially to locate the
                 Communication Server to connect to for a given realm.
                 You can specify up to eight LNS servers. WARNING: you
                 will be able to access only the realms that are (or will
                 be) served by one of the LNS servers you specify.

                     This file will contain a list of one of more LNS nodes.
                     BASEstar Open Client will attempt the connection to the
                     Server environment by scanning this list.
                     Please provide at least one host name; you will be prompted
                     for additional names until an empty line is entered.

                     The BSTR_ETC:bstrcom_MYNODE.cfg file can be modified by means
                     of a common text editor.

    Configuring and Managing BASEstar Open Client on a OpenVMS System
    5.1 Setting Up and Starting the BASEstar Open Client Environment


    5.1.2 Starting Up BASEstar Open Client

          You cannot start up BASEstar Open Client unless you have
          the necessary authorization (see Section 5.1.1).

          To perform the startup procedure, execute the following
          commands:

          $  bstr$kitclt:[etc]bstrusers
          $  bstr_node_start

          After executing the bstr_node_start command, you can run
          BASEstar Open Client applications. To do so, follow these
          steps:

          1. Include the following statement in your login.com file:

             $  @bstr$kitclt:[etc]bstrusers

          2. Set the environment variable BSTR_REALM to the name of
             the Realm that you wish to use on the system(s) running
             BASEstar Open servers. You cannot perform any BASEstar
             Open Client operations on these systems until you have
             configured and started the Realm.

          Example:

          $  DEFINE BSTR_RLM R2
          $  cli_bstr

    5.1.3 Shutting Down BASEstar Open Client

          Shutting down the BASEstar Open Client means to stop the
          processes that manage the connections between the client
          and the server sides.

          You cannot shut down BASEstar Open Client unless you have
          the necessary authorization (see Section 5.1.1).

          To perform the shutdown procedure, execute the following
          commands:

          $  @bstr$kitclt:[etc]bstrusers
          #  bstr_node_shut [-v]

          The bstr_node_shut procedure shuts down BASEstar
          Open Client without checking to see whether any
          client applications are running. Therefore, it is the
          responsibility of the user to ensure that no client
          applications are running before executing bstr_node_shut.

         5.1 Setting Up and Starting the BASEstar Open Client Environment


        5.1.4 Unsetting BASEstar Open Client

              Unsetting BASEstar Open means to delete the files and
              directories created by bstr_node_setup.

              You must shut down BASEstar Open Client before you perform
              the unset procedure. Execute the following commands:

              $  @bstr$kitclt:[etc]bstrusers
              $  bstr_node_unset [-v]

        5.2 Getting Help and Reporting Problems

              If an error occurs while you are using BASEstar Open
              Client, and you believe the error is the result of a
              problem associated with the product, take one of the
              following actions:

              o  If you have a basic or COMPAQ support Software
                 Agreement, call your Customer Support Center (CSC). The
                 CSC provides telephone support for high-level advisory
                 and remedial assistance.

              o  If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement, you
                 can submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

              o  If you purchased BASEstar Open Client within the last 90
                 days and you think the problem is caused by a software
                 error, you can submit an SPR.

              If you submit an SPR, please take the following steps:

              1. Describe as accurately as possible the circumstances and
                 state of the system when the problem occurred. Include
                 the description and version number of BASEstar Open
                 Client that you were using. Demonstrate the problem with
                 specific examples.

              2. Reduce the problem to as small a size as possible.

              3. Remember to include listings of any command files,
                 include files, relevant data files, and so forth.

              4. Provide a listing of the program.

              5. If the program is longer than 50 lines, submit a copy
                 of it on machine-readable media (floppy diskette or
                 magnetic tape). If necessary, also submit a copy of the
                 program library used to build the application.

                                                                      5-5

 



    Configuring and Managing BASEstar Open Client on a OpenVMS System
    5.2 Getting Help and Reporting Problems


          6. Report only one problem per SPR. This will facilitate a
             faster response.

          7. Mail the SPR package to COMPAQ.

          Experience shows that many SPRs do not contain enough
          information to duplicate or identify the problem. Concise,
          complete information helps COMPAQ give accurate and timely
          service to software problems.

          If you find an error in the BASEstar Open Client
          documentation, send an electronic mail message to
          manufacturing@compaq.com.

        6.1 Executing Environment Commands

              This section outlines the general requirements for
              executing environment commands successfully. The
              description of each individual command includes specific
              command requirements.

              If you execute a command successfully, BASEstar Open
              returns the following exit status:

              1 (one)

              If a command fails, it returns a different value in the
              command exit status. It also displays one or more messages
              that provide information about the error(s) that occurred
              during execution of the command. The log file often
              contains additional information about the components used
              to execute the command (see Chapter 7).

        6.1.1 Requirements and Constraints

              This section explains which users can execute specific
              environment management commands, and specifies the rules
              that you must follow when executing a command.

        6.1.1.1 Users and Commands

              Not all OpenVMS users can execute all the environment
              management commands. Table 6-1 identifies which user can
              execute a given command, where

              o  Root indicates the SYSTEM user or any user with all
                 privileges.

                                                                      6-1

 



    Environment Management Command Reference
    6.1 Executing Environment Commands


          o  Spool user indicates the user responsible for managing
             a given Node. For a given Node, the spool user is
             the SYSTEM user (default) or the user whose name was
             specified when the bstr_node_setup command was executed
             for that Node.

             The spool user must have all the privileges.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             If root or spool user is specified for a command, it
             means that only that particular user can execute the
             command.

          The cli_bstr command allows you to invoke the BASEstar Open
          CLI. You can execute CLI commands either interactively, or
          in batch mode by specifying the name of a command file from
          the command interpreter prompt.

    Options

          -c

          This option allows you to check the syntax and semantics of
          a CLI command file without executing the file.

          -e "command1" "command2"..."command10"

          This option allows you to execute up to ten CLI commands
          without leaving the platform-dependent command interpreter.
          After executing the specified commands, the command
          interpreter redisplays the CLI prompt. Enclose each CLI
          command between double quotes, and make sure that the
          commands are separated by at least one blank.

          -f command_file

          Pathname of a CLI command file that BASEstar Open executes
          at the shell prompt.

          -i startup_file

          An optional startup command file that you can request the
          CLI to execute. If you fail to specify the -i option,
          BASEstar Open does not execute a startup command file
          unless the following CLI command file exists in your home
          directory:

          cli_init.ini

                 This command invokes the CLI so that you can execute
                 commands in interactive mode.

              2. $ cli_bstr -e "SET SCOPE VOLATILE" "SHOW DATA_POINT /DOM1/DP3"<Return>
                $

                 This command sequence sets the VODB scope and displays
                 the /DOM1/DP3 Data_Point.

              3. $ cli_bstr -f exec2.com<Return>
                $

                 This command executes the exec2.com CLI command file at
                 the shell prompt.

    bstr_node_setup



    _________________________________________________________________

    bstr_node_setup

          This command creates a series of directories and
          configuration files on the Node on which you execute it.
          It allows you to define configuration parameters relative
          to the Name Services and BASEstar Open working directories.

    Syntax

          bstr_node_setup -l  location [-adv] [-v]

    Description

          You must execute the bstr_node_setup command for the Node
          on which you installed BASEstar Open Client and you want to
          tun it.

          Before running the bstr_node_setup command, you must log
          in as SYSTEM. The bstr_node_setup command is in the ETC
          directory, under the BASEstar Open Client installation
          directory.

          You cannot execute the bstr_node_setup command if there are
          BASEstar Open processes currently active (all environment
          and application components must be shut down first).

          The bstr_node_setup command performs the following
          operations:

          o  Creates the configuration files for the Node-specific
             environment components.

          o  Creates the command procedures that can be used to set
             the values of the installation-dependent BASEstar Open
             global variables .

          o  Creates the subtree that stores the BASEstar Open
             temporary files created at run-time.

    Options

          -l location
          The pathname of the directory where the BASEstar Open
          Client kit is installed. It must be an absolute OpenVMS
          file specification.

                                                          bstr_node_setup



              -adv
              Advanced Node setup. You can change the name and
              characteristics of the subtree under which the BASEstar
              Open temporary files are stored at run-time.

              -v
              This option displays additional information on execution of
              the command.

        Usage Notes

              While executing the bstr_node_setup command, press <Return>
              to accept the default value displayed between square
              brackets. Press <Ctrl/C> at any time to abort the bstr_
              node_setup command.

              The lines displayed by the bstr_node_setup command
              start with different character strings, depending on the
              operation being performed. The following character strings
              can be displayed:

              o  The @@@ string identifies a message that describes the
                 operation in progress.

              o  The &&& string identifies an error message (error or
                 fatal error).

              Lines that are displayed without any of the above character
              strings are input requests.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The name of the less extensive option that displays a
                given parameter is specified within brackets.

                ______________________________________________________

              Changing Configuration Parameters

              The bstr_node_setup command allows you to display and
              change the values of some configuration parameters. All
              the bstr_node_setup command prompts and displays are listed
              below.

              BSTR.Spool_Work_Dir []:

                                                                      6-7

 



    bstr_node_setup



          Enter a file specification for the Node-specific BASEstar
          Open Client working directory (for example disk3:[work_
          naxos]). The directory in question must not already exist.
          You must specify a dedicated working directory for each
          Node. You cannot specify a snapshot directory (see next
          prompt) or a descendant directory of a snapshot directory.

          This parameter is mandatory.

          BSTR.Spool_Owner [current_user]:

          Available with the -adv option. Name of the user who owns
          the working and snapshot directory trees. The specified
          user must exist.

          BSTR.Spool_Protection_Mode "(S:rwed,O:rwed,G:rwed,O:rwed)

          Available with the -adv option. Protection mask applied
          to the working and snapshot directory trees. The
          default value restricts directories access to the owner
          (BSTR.Spool_Owner) and the group (BSTR.Spool_Group).

          Host name of a BASEstar Open LNS Server node:

          Name of the Node on which BASEstar Open Client is to
          contact the LNS name server. This question will be repeated
          until the user types an empty line. When a realm is to be
          accessed, BASEstar Open Client will contact the LNS name
          servers in the specified order until it reaches one that
          manages the realm.

          Complete or Abort Command Execution

          The following prompt allows you to interrupt execution of
          the command:

          Do you want to continue ? [Y]:

          Enter y to terminate command execution by leaving the
          system unaltered, enter n to continue.

          Creating Configuration and Command Procedures

          After displaying the values of the configuration parameters
          (and allowing you to modify them if necessary), the bstr_
          node_setup command displays a series of messages informing
          you that configuration and script files are being created
          or edited. The files created by bstr_node_setup are:

          o  The bstrusers_<node_name>.com command procedure, which
             allows users to set installation-dependent global
             variables.

                                                          bstr_node_setup



              o  The bstrcom_<node_name>.cfg text file that stores the
                 names of the host names where the LNS name servers are
                 to be contacted. This text file can be modified directly
                 by the user.

              o  The SYS$STARTUP:BSTR$STARTUPCLT.COM command procedure,
                 which performs the following operations:

                 -  Defines the BSTR$KITCLT logical name with the file
                    specification of the installation directory.

                 -  Executes the bstrusers.com command file.

                 -  Executes the bstr_node_start command.

              Creating BASEstar Open Work Directories

              Finally, the bstr_node_setup command creates the basic
              BASEstar Open work directories using the specified values.

              On completion, the bstr_node_setup command returns you to
              the DCL prompt.

        Examples

              1.$ @DKA200:[BSTRCLT.ETC]bstr_node_setup -L DKA200:[BSTRCLT] <Return>

                Name of the work directory. You must introduce the path name
                    (according to  the rules of VAX/VMS - .e.g. "DISK:[SUBD1.SUBD2]" )
                    of an UNEXISTING directory :

                If you are not satisfied with the settings of installation
                parameters you can terminate the procedure and run it again:

                Do you want to continue ? [Y] :<Return>

                @@@ creating BSTR_ETC:bstrcom_VIGGIU.cfg file

                    This file will contain a list of one of more LNS nodes.
                    BASEstar Open Client will attempt the connection to the
                    Server environment by scanning this list.
                    Please provide at least one host name; you will be prompted
                    for additional names until an empty line is entered.

                    The BSTR_ETC:bstrcom_VIGGIU.cfg file can be modified by means
                    of a common text editor.

    bstr_node_start



    _________________________________________________________________

    bstr_node_start

          Starts up the Node-specific environment components.

    Syntax

          bstr_node_start [-v] [-c]

    Description

          The bstr_node_start command starts up the Node-specific
          environment components and checks for license and
          environment integrity on the Node.

          Execute the bstr_node_start command for each Node on which
          you want to start up BASEstar Open Client. Before running
          the bstr_node_start command, execute the bstr_node_setup
          command to set up the Node.

          Starting up a Node does not affect operations on other
          Nodes.

          On completion, the bstr_node_start command outputs messages
          notifying you of its successful completion (all the Node-
          specific components have been started up), or unsuccessful
          completion (no components have been started up).

    Options

                                                    Log Services Features


              The Log Services collect and record information regarding
              general events and error conditions detected by the Node
              components. BASEstar Open Client activates a Log Services
              server process on the Node. The Log Services server
              process:

              o  Collects log records sent from the other Node-specific
                 components and writes them to the Node log file

              o  Creates a log file for each Realm that has been accessed

              o  Collects log records from the components operating with
                 the Realms that are accessed from the Node and writes
                 them to the Realm log file.

              The information collected in the log files is intended
              primarily to help COMPAQ support personnel. However,
              you can also use it to monitor the behavior of actions
              performed by your environment components.

        7.1 Saving Copies of Log Files

              The Log Services operator interface consists of the CLI
              commands shown in Table 7-1 (see Chapter 8 for a complete
              description).

    Log Services Features
    7.1 Saving Copies of Log Files


          You can swap the contents of a working copy log file into a
          save copy by using the OPEN LOG command which also empties
          up the log file working copy. The OPEN LOG command appends
          a user-specified string at the end of the just created save
          copy, and inserts the same string at the top of the emptied
          log file working copy.

          Working and save copies of the log files are assigned
          the following names, where N is a number that is assigned
          sequentially:

          o  The name of the log file working copy for the current
             Node is BASESTARNODE.log, whereas the name of the save
             copies is BASESTARNODE_N.log.

          o  The name of the working copy log file for a Realm log
             file is realm_name.log, whereas the name of the save
             copies is realm_name_N.log.

          BASEstar Open stores the log files in the following
          directory:

          BSTR_WORK_ROOT:[node.log]

    7.1.1 Purging Log Files

          With the exception of the working copies, you can delete
          all the log files that have been created on a Node. To do
          so, specify the -c option when executing the bstr_node_
          start command for the Node.

    7.2 Log File Record Format

          Log files are ASCII files containing log records whose
          format is defined by BASEstar Open and consists of:

          o  The sequence number associated with a log message
             generated by the Log Services server. This number is
             reset to 0 when the Log Services server is started up
             (that is, when you execute the bstr_node_start command),
             and is incremented by 1 for each message generated.

             The Log Services server writes each log message to a log
             file. Each message therefore has a sequence number that
             does not depend on the log file to which it is written.
             The message number is unique for each message logged on
             the Node.

              o  The date and time when the log record was written to the
                 log file

              o  The process identifier of the component that generated
                 the log record

              o  An identifier (see Table 7-2) that indicates the
                 environment component responsible for generating the
                 log message.

              o  The text of the log record message.

    7.2.1 Displaying Log Files

          The log files are ASCII files that can be displayed by
          using any platform-dependent tool or editor. You must
          perform different operations depending on whether you want
          to display a working copy or save copy of a log file.

          See Section 7.1 to know about where log files are stored
          and about log file naming conventions.

                                               7.2 Log File Record Format


        7.2.1.1 Displaying a Save Copy

              To display a save copy of a log file, use any command or
              utility that can display an ASCII file.

        7.2.1.2 Displaying a Working Copy

              The working copy log files are opened by the Log Services
              server and thus they cannot be displayed by using the
              standard tools when the Node is started up. Thus, the
              DISPLAY LOG command has been provided to allow the display
              of log file working copies. This command also can display
              the last lines of a log file automatically refreshing them
              as soon as a new record is inserted in the displayed log
              file. This allows you to monitor record insertion in the
              selected log file.

        7.3 Log Services Server Activities

              The Log Services server process is a Node-specific
              component which is started up when you execute the bstr_
              node_start command.

              In turn, the Log Services server logs some record
              information regarding general events and unrecoverable
              errors detected during execution in the platform-dependent
              system log.

    DISPLAY LOG



    _________________________________________________________________

    DISPLAY LOG

          Displays the contents of a log file working copy.

    Format

          DISPLAY LOG

          Command Qualifier              Default

          [-REALM realm_name]            Current Realm
          [-NODE]                        Current Node
          [-HEAD head_lines]              10
          [-TAIL tail_lines]              10
          [-CONTINUE]

    Description

          The DISPLAY LOG command allows you to display records from
          both Realm and Node log file working copies.

          The -REALM and -NODE qualifiers are mutually exclusive:

          o  If you specify the -REALM qualifier, the realm_name
             argument indicates the name of the Realm.

          o  If you specify the -NODE qualifier, BASEstar Open
             displays the log file for the Node that you are
             addressing.

          o  If you do not specify either the -REALM or the -NODE
             qualifier, BASEstar Open assumes the value of the -NODE
             qualifier by default.

          If you provide a value for the head_lines (tail_lines)
          argument, the DISPLAY LOG command displays the requested
          lines starting from the top (bottom) of the selected log
          file.

          If you specify both the -CONTINUE and -TAIL qualifiers,
          the DISPLAY LOG command displays the last tail_lines
          and refresh them automatically as soon as a new record
          is inserted in the displayed log file. This allows you
          to monitor record insertion in the selected log file. To
          terminate execution of a command, press

        Qualifiers

              -REALM realm_name
              The realm_name argument specifies the local name of the
              Realm whose log file you want to display. The Realm in
              question already be started on the current Node.

              This qualifier and the -NODE qualifier are mutually
              exclusive.

              -NODE
              Directs the DISPLAY LOG command to display the log file of
              the current Node.

              This qualifier and the -NODE qualifier are mutually
              exclusive. If you do not specify either the -REALM or the
              -NODE qualifier, BASEstar Open assumes the value of the
              -NODE qualifier by default.

              -HEAD head_lines
              Directs the command to display the number of lines
              specified by the head_lines argument starting from the top
              of the selected log file. The -TAIL and -HEAD qualifiers
              are mutually exclusive.

              -TAIL tail_lines
              Directs the command to display the number of lines
              specified by the tail_lines argument starting from the
              bottom of the selected log file. The -TAIL and -HEAD
              qualifiers are mutually exclusive.

              -CONTINUE
              Directs the DISPLAY LOG command to display the last tail_
              lines and to refresh them as soon as a new record is
              inserted in the displayed log file. This allows you to
              monitor record insertion in the selected log file. When
              specified, the -CONTINUE qualifier must be specified
              together with the -TAIL qualifier.

          [-DESCRIPTION string]          No Description

    Description

          The OPEN LOG command performs the following actions for the
          current Node or the specified Realm:

          1. Closes the working copy log file and renames it into a
             save copy.

          2. Appends the string specified by the -DESCRIPTION
             qualifier at the end of the just created save copy.

          3. Creates and opens a new empty working copy log file and
             inserts the same string specified by the -DESCRIPTION
             qualifier.

          The -REALM and -NODE qualifiers are mutually exclusive. If
          neither the -REALM nor the -NODE qualifier is specified,
          the -NODE qualifier is assumed by default. Assuming that N
          is a progressively assigned number:

          o  The name of the log file for the current Node is
             BASESTARNODE.log, while save copies have name
             BASESTARNODE_N.log.

          o  The name of the log file for a Realm log file is realm_
             name.log, while save copies have name BASESTARNODE-
             N.log.

          Log files are stored under the following directory:

        Qualifiers

              -REALM realm_name
              Tells the OPEN LOG command to address the working copy
              of the log file for the realm_name. If you do not specify
              this qualifier, BASEstar Open assumes by default the Realm
              specified by the BSTR_REALM global variable. The Realm in
              question must already be started on the current Node.

              This qualifier and the -NODE qualifier are mutually
              exclusive.

              -NODE
              Tells the OPEN LOG command to address the working copy of
              the log file for the current Node.

              This qualifier and the -NODE qualifier are mutually
              exclusive. If you do not specify either the -REALM or the
              -NODE qualifier, BASEstar Open assumes the -NODE qualifier
              by default.

              -DESCRIPTION string
              User-defined information that appears at the end of a save
              copy and at the top of the working copy log file.

              The description need not conform to any format and must
              be enclosed between quotation marks (" "). The string
              argument is a string of maximum 128 characters.
