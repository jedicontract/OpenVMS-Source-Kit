          Whether you are a new customer or a continuing customer with a
          Software Product Services (SPS) contract, please take time to
          read the following information about your product.

          News for Application Developers

          If you are interested in using Compaq C to build client/server
          applications that interoperate with Windows[R] based systems,
          please see the release notes for important information on a
          Compaq product called The Application Developer's Package for
          C/C++.

          Installation Information

          Installing this product requires the OpenVMS VAX[R] operating
          system Version 5.5-2 or higher. The installation kit contains
          media for installing the Compaq C compiler, as well as the
          Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components Version 6.0 for OpenVMS VAX
          Systems.

          Installing the compiler requires 100,000 blocks of free disk
          space (180,000 blocks to also install the documentation).
          Installing the Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components kit requires
          17,000 blocks.

          To use Compaq C on systems running OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2
          or 6.0, you must install the Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components
          kit in a separate step before installing the compiler. OpenVMS
          VAX versions higher than 6.0 require that you install only the
          compiler.

          Release Notes Information

          License Registration

          Before you install and run Compaq C Version 6.4 on a newly li-
          censed node or cluster, you must first register a License Prod-
          uct Authorization Key (License PAK) using the License Management
          Facility (LMF). The License PAK may be shipped along with the
          kit if you ordered the license and media together; otherwise, it
          is shipped separately to a location based on your license order.
          If you are installing Compaq C as an update on a node or cluster
          already licensed for this software, you have already completed
          the License PAK registration requirements.

          If you are installing prerequisite or optional software along
          with Compaq C, review the PAK status and install the PAKs for
          any prerequisite or optional software before you install Compaq C.

          Dependent Product Redistribution Information

          The Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components kit contains shareable
          image run-time components. When the Compaq C kit is installed on
          OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2 systems, some of the shareable image
          run-time components replace older versions of existing OpenVMS
          components.

          Compaq has engineered the Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components kit
          specifically to allow redistribution with any application that
          uses one or more of these components. Redistributing this kit
          requires that the kit and its documentation be shipped to the
          remote site receiving any such application. See the Compaq C/C++
          Run-Time Components for OpenVMS VAX Reference and Installation
          Guide for detailed installation and redistribution instructions.
