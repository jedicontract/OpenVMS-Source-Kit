                                      Preparing for Compaq C Installation


              This chapter discusses the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing Compaq C for OpenVMS VAX Systems.

              This guide applies to Compaq C for OpenVMS VAX Version
              6.4 and all subsequent maintenance releases up to the
              next release of the product that includes an updated
              installation guide.

              Your bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report
              (BIL) specify the number and contents of your media.
              Be sure to verify the contents of your kit with this
              information. If your kit is damaged or if you find
              that parts of it are missing, contact your Compaq
              representative.

              Compaq C provides separate online release notes. The
              release notes contain installation-related notes and a
              summary of technical changes, known problems, restrictions,
              and incompatibilities. Reading the release notes before
              proceeding with the installation is strongly recommended.
              For information on accessing the online release notes, see
              Section 2.1.

        1.1 Required Operating System Components

              Compaq C for OpenVMS VAX Systems, Version 6.4 requires
              OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2 or higher.

              The OpenVMS VAX (formerly VAX VMS) operating system comes
              with a variety of support options, including such features
              as networking and RMS journaling. To use Compaq C, your
              system should be running a version of OpenVMS that includes
              the following:

              o  Programming support

              o  Utilities

                                  Preparing for Compaq C Installation 1-1

 







        1.2 Prerequisite Software

              If you are installing Compaq C on OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2
              or Version 6.0, you must first install the Compaq C/C++
              Run-Time Components kit. See the Compaq C/C++ Run-Time
              Components for OpenVMS VAX Reference and Installation Guide
              .

        1.3 Optional Software

              See the Software Support Addendum (SSA) that comes with
              the Software Product Description (SPD) for a complete list
              of prerequisite and optional software products and their
              required version numbers.

              Note that Compaq C and VAX C can coexist on your system.
              The CC command is used to invoke either the VAX C or
              Compaq C compiler. If your system has a VAX C compiler
              already installed on it, you have the option of specifying
              which compiler will be invoked by default whenever just
              the CC command verb is used. To invoke the compiler that
              is not the default, use the CC command with the appropriate
              qualifier: /DECC for the Compaq C compiler, or /VAXC for
              the VAX C compiler. See the Compaq C release notes for more
              information.

        1.4 License Registration

              Before you install and run Compaq C Version 6.4 on a newly
              licensed node or cluster, you must first register a License
              Product Authorization Key (License PAK) using the License
              Management Facility (LMF). The License PAK may be shipped
              along with the kit if you ordered the license and media
              together; otherwise, it is shipped separately to a location
              based on your license order.

              If you are installing Compaq C as an update on a node
              or cluster already licensed for this software, you
              have already completed the License PAK registration
              requirements.

              If you are installing prerequisite or optional software
              along with Compaq C, review the PAK status and install the
              PAKs for any prerequisite or optional software before you
              install Compaq C.

        1-2 Preparing for Compaq C Installation

 







              You must register and load your license for Compaq C
              before you start the installation to run the Installation
              Verification Procedure (IVP) and use the software.

              To register a license under OpenVMS VAX, first log in
              to the system manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a
              choice of two ways to perform the registration:

              o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it
                 prompts you for information, respond with data from your
                 License PAK.

              o  At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command
                 with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to the
                 License PAK information.

              If you plan to use Compaq C on more than one node in a
              VAXcluster, you will need to perform a license load on
              the other nodes after you complete this installation. See
              Section 3.3.

              For complete information on using LMF, see the VMS License
              Management Utility Manual.

        1.5 Installation Procedure Requirements

              This section discusses various requirements for installing
              Compaq C.

              Each installation takes approximately 10 to 60 minutes,
              depending on your type of media and your system
              configuration.

              Installing Compaq C and running the Installation
              Verification Procedure (IVP) on a standalone VAXstation
              4000-60 system takes approximately 15 minutes.

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks if you want to continue the
              installation. In some instances, you can type YES to
              continue. To stop the installation process and correct
              the situation, type NO or press Return. Then correct the
              problem and restart the installation.

        1.5.1 Privileges and Disk Space

              To install Compaq C, you must be logged in to an account
              that has SETPRV or at least the following privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

              VMSINSTAL turns off BYPASS privilege at the start of the
              installation.

              The Compaq C requirements for free disk storage space are
              different during installation and after installation.
              Table 1-1 lists the storage requirements. You can now
              install the C documentation in .ps, .txt, and .html
              formats. The installation default is to not install the
              documentation, but if you do, note the additional disk
              space required.

              $ SHOW DEVICE SYS$SYSDEVICE

        1.5.2 Process Account Quotas

              The account you use to install Compaq C must have
              sufficient quotas to enable you to perform the
              installation. Table 1-2 summarizes the process quotas
              required for the installation account.

              User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT. Use
              the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to verify and
              change process quotas for the installation account. (Some
              sites may restrict the use of the OpenVMS Authorize Utility
              to certain accounts or people.) For example, to change the
              BIOLM quota for the account-name installation account, you
              might enter the following command sequence:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE
              UAF> MODIFY account-name/BIOLM = 160
              UAF> SHOW account-name
              UAF> EXIT
              $ LOGOUT

              After the quotas for the installation account have been
              changed, log out of the installation account and log in
              again for the new quotas to take effect. You can then
              proceed with the installation.

              For more information on modifying account quotas, see the
              description of the Authorize Utility in the OpenVMS System
              Management Subkit.

        1.5.3 System Parameters

              Installing Compaq C requires certain system parameter
              settings.

              The minimum number of contiguous free global pages and
              global sections needed for the installation depends on
              whether
              SYS$SYSTEM:DECC$COMPILER.EXE was previously installed as a
              shared known image. See Table 1-3.

              Yes            4            Approximately 2000 contiguous
                                          free global pages plus
                                          a sufficient number of
                                          contiguous free global
                                          pages to contain the file
              ____________________________SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE______

              These values represent the number of contiguous free global
              pages and global sections required for the installation,
              not the total number you need to run your system and other
              software.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                You must ensure that your system has the necessary
                global page and global section SYSGEN quotas for the
                installation. Failure to do so could cause the DCL
                tables to be corrupted in some situations.

                ______________________________________________________

        1.5.3.1 Calculating the Values for CONTIG_GBLPAGES and
                FREE_GBLSECTS

              To install and run Compaq C, you must have sufficient
              contiguous free global pages and free global sections.
              You must first find out how many free global pages and
              sections you have on your system. Use AUTOGEN if you need
              to increase the CONTIG_GBLPAGES and FREE_GBLSECTS system
              parameters.

              Enter the following DCL command to determine the number of
              global pages required by SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE:

              $ DIR/SIZE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE

        1-6 Preparing for Compaq C Installation

 







              This command returns the size (in blocks) of
              SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE. As an approximation, use this
              figure as the number of global pages needed for the file.

              You can use the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical
              function to find the number of contiguous free global pages
              and free global sections. The following example shows how
              to get this information at your terminal (the default for
              SYS$OUTPUT):

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("CONTIG_GBLPAGES")
              15848
              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")
              24

              If the value of contiguous free global pages or free
              global sections is less than the value required (see
              Section 1.5.3), you must increase the system parameter
              setting.

              Section 1.5.3.2 describes the procedures for increasing
              these values using AUTOGEN.

        1.5.3.2 Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN

              If you do not have enough contiguous free global pages or
              free global sections to install Compaq C, you can do either
              of the following:

              o  Delete an existing known image using the OpenVMS Install
                 Utility.

              o  Use the AUTOGEN command procedure to increase the
                 GBLPAGES or GBLSECTIONS system parameters.

              AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for parameters that
              are associated with the values you reset manually. To
              change system parameters with AUTOGEN, edit the following
              file:

              SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

              Use an editor to access the file. To change a parameter
              value listed in this file, delete the current value
              associated with that parameter and enter the new value.

                                  Preparing for Compaq C Installation 1-7

 







              To add a new parameter, add a line to the file that
              includes both the name of the parameter and its value.
              For example:

              WSMAX = 8096

              To modify incremental parameters such as GBLPAGES and
              GBLSECTIONS, use ADD_GBLPAGES and ADD_GBLSECTIONS,
              respectively. The following example increases the global
              page setting by 2000:

              ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000

              Be aware that when you set the page file quota, you should
              not use a value that exceeds the amount of page file space
              available on the system.

              After you make all your changes, exit from the editor and
              execute the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
              parameters. Enter the following command to recalculate your
              system parameters and reboot the system:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN SAVPARAMS REBOOT

              When you specify REBOOT, AUTOGEN performs an automatic
              system shutdown and then reboots the system. Any users
              logged on to the system are immediately disconnected during
              the shutdown. The automatic reboot puts the new parameter
              values into effect.

              The AUTOGEN Utility automatically adjusts some of the
              SYSGEN parameters based on the consumption of resources
              since the last reboot. If you do not want to take advantage
              of this automatic adjustment, include the NOFEEDBACK
              qualifier on the AUTOGEN command line.

              For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the OpenVMS
              System Management Subkit.

        1.5.4 Backing Up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if you
              have backed up your system disk. Doing a system disk backup
              before installing any software is strongly recommended.

              Use the backup procedures that are established at your
              site. For details on performing a system disk backup, see
              the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS System
              Management Subkit.

        1.6 Installing and Using Multiple Compiler Versions

              Compaq C Version 6.4 provides initial support for
              installing and using multiple versions of the compiler
              on the same node.

              During installation of Version 6.4, if a Version 6.0 or
              Version 6.2 of the compiler is already installed, you
              have the opportunity to preserve that compiler rather
              than overwrite it. If you choose to preserve the currently
              installed compiler, you are then given a choice to keep
              the currently installed compiler as the system default and
              install the new compiler as an alternate.

              By default, the currently installed system compiler is
              preserved by making it an alternate compiler and installing
              the new compiler as the system default. Users can make
              the choice to use an alternate compiler instead of the
              installed system compiler by running a command procedure
              that changes the behavior of the cc command for the process
              that invokes it.

              Some details of the following description may change, but
              the mechanism is essentially as follows.

        1.6.1 Displaying and Selecting the Compiler Version

              This kit provides two command procedures to display and
              control which Compaq C compiler is used by a process:

              o  SYS$SYSTEM:DECC$SHOW_VERSIONS.COM

                 This procedure displays the Compaq C compilers available
                 on the system, along with their version numbers. It also
                 displays which compiler is the default for the current
                 process. The procedure takes an optional version-number
                 argument. Examples:

                 $ @sys$system:decc$show_versions.com

                 The following Compaq C compiler(s) are available in
                 SYS$SYSTEM:

                 ---------------------------------------
                 DECC$COMPILER_V06_00-001.EXE  V6.0-001    Process Default

              o  SYS$SYSTEM:DECC$SET_VERSION.COM

                 This procedure sets up process logicals that point
                 to an alternate Compaq C compiler in SYS$SYSTEM, or
                 it removes the process logicals to revert to using
                 the default system compiler. The procedure takes one
                 argument, a version number or the keyword SYSTEM.
                 If no arguments are specified you are prompted for
                 them. The SYSTEM argument selects the installed
                 system compiler, which is the one displayed with the
                 filename DECC$COMPILER.EXE in the output of decc$show_
                 versions.com. Alternate compilers are shown in that
                 output with their version number appended to the simple
                 filename (DECC$COMPILER_V06_02-008.EXE in the previous
                 example).

                 To select a compiler, pass a full ident string or enough
                 of the ident string to be unique. For example: to select
                 the V6.2-008 compiler from the previous list, pass
                 V6.2-008 or V6.2 to the decc$set_version.com routine.
                 However, to select a 6.4 compiler, a full ident string
                 is required to distinguish between the V6.4-005, T6.4-
                 001, and the T6.4-002 compiler:

        @sys$system:decc$set_version.com V6.2-008

            "SYS$MESSAGE:DECC$MSG_SHR_V06_02-008.EXE"

        $ @decc$set_version.com 6.4

        The following 6.4 Compaq C compiler(s) are available in
        SYS$SYSTEM:

        Filename                      Version
        ---------------------------------------
        DECC$COMPILER.EXE             V6.4-005
        DECC$COMPILER_T06_04-001.EXE  T6.4-001
        DECC$COMPILER_T06_04-002.EXE  T6.4-002

$ sho logical DECC$msg_shr
"DECC$MSG_SHR" = "SYS$MESSAGE:DECC$MSG_SHR_V06_04-005.EXE" (LNM$PROCESS_TABLE)

                 When this procedure is run in a process, subsequent cc
                 commands invoke the selected compiler version (until the
                 procedure is run again). The process-level logicals used
                 do not affect other processes or users on the system.

        1.6.2 Side Effects and Restrictions on Multiple Versions

              When you install this kit, it provides the latest CLD file
              (to established DCL tables), the latest decc$rtldef.tlb,
              and the latest documentation, even if you select the option
              of having the new compiler as the alternate compiler. The
              new CLD file and the new decc$rtldef.tlb do not adversely
              impact a preexisting Version 6-based compiler because they
              are upwardly compatible. However, if you attempt to use
              a new compiler option with an older compiler, you will no
              longer get a DCL error that the option is not supported.
              Instead, the option will be silently ignored. For example,
              note that before installation of Version 6.4, the following
              would have produced: "%DCL-W-IVQUAL, unrecognized qualifier
              ...."

              $ cc /first_include foo.c  ! /first_include new in 6.4
              $ !No complaint

              And because you must have the newest CLD file and header
              files in order to use the newest compiler, if you run
              an older installation procedure to put an older compiler
              back on your system, you must then re-run the Version 6.4
              installation to get the newest files.

              Note that there are two logical names involved in
              establishing the compiler version: one for the compiler
              image and one for its message file. This version of the
              compiler issues a diagnostic if it is invoked with the
              wrong version of the message file, but prevous versions of
              the compiler do not detect this situation. If you find that
              an older version of the compiler is issuing diagnostics
              that do not make sense for the code construct they are
              attached to, or if the message text is missing and only
              a message number is issued, check that you have matched
              versions of the files designated by the two logicals
              using the command "$ show logical decc$compiler*". The
              response should show matching version-numbered files as
              in the example that selects the Version 6.2 compiler.
              Or if you are using the system compiler, the response
              should be "%SHOW-S-NOTRAN, no translation for logical name
              DECC$COMPILER*".

        1.6.3 Installation Procedure Changes

              When you install Compaq C Version 6.4 on a system that
              already has a Version 6.0 or higher compiler installed, you
              are given the chance to preserve the currently installed
              system compiler. To do this, answer YES to the following
              question (the xxx will be replaced by the full version
              number of the existing system compiler):

              "Should the existing xxx system compiler be preserved [NO]:"

              If you answer NO, the installation proceeds in the
              traditional manner, overwriting the currently installed
              system compiler.



        1-12 Preparing for Compaq C Installation

 







              If you answer YES, you are then asked an additional
              question. To get the traditional behavior of installing
              the kit compiler as the system default, answer NO to the
              question:

   "Should this xxx system compiler remain the default when cc is typed [NO]:"

              Because you have previously asked to preserve the existing
              system compiler, that compiler is made an alternate
              compiler before the new system compiler is installed
              from the kit. If you answer YES to the question, the kit
              compiler is installed as an alternate compiler with a name
              that is based on its ident, and the existing system default
              compiler remains the default.

                                                      Installing Compaq C


              This chapter explains how to install Compaq C:

              o  Section 2.1 contains a step-by-step description of the
                 installation procedure.

              o  Section 2.2 covers error recovery considerations.

        2.1 Installation Procedure

              The Compaq C installation procedure consists of a series
              of questions and informational messages. See Appendix A for
              sample installations.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              exits. You can then start the installation again.

              Defaults appear in brackets ([]) throughout the
              installation procedure.

              1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
                 device and directory to SYS$UPDATE, where VMSINSTAL
                 resides.

                 Username: SYSTEM
                 Password:
                 $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE

              2. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

                 @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL saveset-name device-name OPTIONS N




                                                  Installing Compaq C 2-1

 







                 saveset-name
                 The installation name for the component. For Compaq C,
                 use the following installation name:

                 CC06n

                 Where n represents the minor (point) release number of
                 Compaq C, such as CC064 for Version 6.4. Refer to the
                 label on the Compaq C distribution kit or the Compaq C
                 BOM or BIL for the maintenance update number of your
                 kit.

                 device-name
                 The name of the device on which you plan to mount
                 the media, or the name of the device:[directory]
                 that contains the save sets. For example, DKA400: is
                 the device name used in examples in this guide. The
                 directory is [CC06n.KIT], where n is the minor release
                 number.

                 To specify the device name on the @VMSINSTAL command
                 line, type:

                 DKA400:[CC06n.KIT]

                 OPTIONS N
                 An optional parameter that indicates you want to see
                 the question on release notes. If you do not include the
                 OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about
                 the release notes. You should review the release notes
                 before proceeding with the installation in case they
                 contain additional information about the installation.
                 If you are restarting the installation and have already
                 reviewed the release notes, you do not need to specify
                 OPTIONS N.

                 There are several other options you can select when you
                 invoke VMSINSTAL:

                 o  Auto_answer (A): Initially creates a file that
                    contains your answers to VMSINSTAL questions
                    and prompts. This option, and the answer file it
                    produces, can save time during a reinstallation
                    (typically after upgrading your system).

        2-2 Installing Compaq C

 







                 o  Get save set (G): Stores product save sets
                    temporarily on a magnetic tape or in a disk
                    directory.

                 o  File log (L): Logs all activity to the terminal
                    during installation.

                 o  Alternate root (R): Installs the product to a system
                    root other than that of the running system.

                 See the OpenVMS documentation on software installation
                 in the OpenVMS System Management Subkit for detailed
                 information on these options. If you specify more
                 than one option, separate the options with commas (for
                 example: OPTIONS A,N).

                 The following example invokes VMSINSTAL to install
                 Compaq C and shows the system response. This example
                 uses the OPTIONS N release note parameter.

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL CC06n DKA400:[CC06n.KIT] OPTIONS N

                   OpenVMS VAX Software Product Installation Procedure V5.5-2

                 It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
                 Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

                 If you do not supply either the product name or the
                 device name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information
                 later in the installation procedure. VMSINSTAL does
                 not prompt you for any options, so be sure to include
                 OPTIONS N on the VMSINSTAL command line to access the
                 release notes during the installation.

                 When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks for the following
                 requirements:

                 o  Whether you logged in to a privileged account. We
                    recommend that you install software from the system
                    manager's account with your default device and
                    directory set to SYS$UPDATE.

                 o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
                    VMSINSTAL checks for the quota values shown in
                    Section 1.5.

                                                  Installing Compaq C 2-3

 







                 o  Whether any users are logged in to the system. If
                    users are logged in, you are asked whether you
                    want to continue the installation. If you want
                    to continue, enter YES. If you want to stop the
                    installation, press Return.

              3. Confirm system backup.

                * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                 VMSINSTAL asks if you are satisfied with your system
                 backup. You should always back up your system disk
                 before performing an installation. If you are satisfied
                 with the backup of your system disk, press Return.
                 Otherwise, enter NO to discontinue the installation.
                 After you back up your system disk, you can restart the
                 installation.

              4. Mount the media.

                 If you omitted the device name in the VMSINSTAL command
                 line, the following prompt appears:

            Where will the distribution volumes be mounted: DKA400:[CC06n.KIT]

                 If this prompt appears, enter the name of the
                 distribution (media) device and directory the contains
                 the Compaq C kit (save set). For example, if the media
                 is contained on a CD located on unit DKA400:, enter
                 DKA400:[CC06n.KIT] in reply to this question (where n is
                 the minor release number.)

                 Depending on the type of device and whether the device
                 is already mounted, the following prompt may or may not
                 appear:

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on DKA400:.
                 * Are you ready? YES
                 %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, Compaq C mounted on DKA400:

                 If you have not already done so, you should now insert
                 the distribution volume on the device you specified when
                 you invoked VMSINSTAL. The device name appears in the
                 line preceding the question. VMSINSTAL then asks you if
                 you are ready to continue with the installation.

        2-4 Installing Compaq C

 







                 If you enter YES to indicate that you are ready,
                 VMSINSTAL displays a message that the media containing
                 Compaq C has been mounted on the specified device and
                 that the installation has started.

                 If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
                 VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, enter NO
                 in response to the "Are you ready?" question. To abort
                 the installation for other reasons, press Ctrl/Y.

              5. Verify the product being installed

                 The following products will be processed:
                   CC V6.n

                     Beginning installation of CC V6.n at 20:00
                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

                 The product name and version are displayed. The save set
                 (A) is restored to a subdirectory of SYS$UPDATE.

              6. Select a release notes option.

           Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

                 Additional Release Notes Options:

                     1.  Display release notes
                     2.  Print release notes
                     3.  Both 1 and 2
                     4.  None of the above

                 * Select option [2]:

                 If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL,
                 you are asked to choose one of the four options for
                 reviewing the release notes.

                 o  Select option 1 to immediately display the release
                    notes online. You can terminate the display at any
                    time by pressing Ctrl/C.

                 o  Select option 2 to print the release notes. You are
                    prompted for the name of the print queue that you
                    want to use:

                    * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                                                  Installing Compaq C 2-5

 







                    Either press Return to send the file to the default
                    output print device (SYS$PRINT) or enter another
                    queue name.

                 o  Select option 3 to immediately display the release
                    notes online and then be prompted for a queue name
                    for the printed version.

                 o  Select option 4 if you have already reviewed the
                    release notes and are restarting the installation.

                 Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following question:

                 * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES
    %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to SYS$HELP.

                 To continue the installation, enter YES. Otherwise,
                 press Return. In either case, the release notes are
                 copied to the following file in the SYS$HELP directory
                 (where n is the minor version number):

                 SYS$HELP:CC06n.RELEASE_NOTES

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The name of the release notes file installed by
                VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name and
                version number. Do not delete release notes for
                previous versions of Compaq C (if any).

                ______________________________________________________

              7. Respond to license registration queries.

                 Compaq C supports the OpenVMS License Management
                 Facility (LMF). The installation procedure displays
                 license information about your product, asks if you want
                 Compaq C documentation installed, and asks if you have
                 registered and loaded your Product Authorization Key
                 (PAK) for Compaq C. The following is an example of such
                 information:

                 Compaq C Version 6.4 for OpenVMS VAX Systems

                   Copyright 2001 Compaq Computer Corporation

        Confidential computer software. Valid license from Compaq required for
        possession, use or copying. Consistent with FAR 12.211 and 12.212,
        Commercial Computer Software, Computer Software Documentation, and
        Technical Data for Commercial Items are licensed to the U.S. Government
        under vendor's standard commercial license.

                      Product:       C
                      Producer:      DEC
                      Version:       6.4
                      Release Date:  dd-mmm-yyyy

     * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?: YES

                 If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you
                 must answer NO to this question. You have to register
                 and load your PAK to run the Installation Verification
                 Procedure (IVP). If you have not done so, you should
                 stop the installation, register and load your PAK, and
                 then restart the installation.

              8. Decide whether to install the documentation.

           HTML, postscript and text versions of the Compaq C Users Guide,
           Language Reference Manual and RTL Reference Manual may be optionally
           installed into SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.CC$VAX_HELP_064].
           These documents consume approximately 40000 blocks.

                * Should these manuals be provided [NO]: yes <Return>

                 If you have adequate disk space and wish to install the
                 C documentation, enter Yes. Once the documentation is
                 installed, you can browse the HTML version by opening
                 the following file from your browser:

                 SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.CC$VAX_HELP_064]INDEX.HTM

              9. Read information about Release Notes.

            This kit contains a file summarizing the new features, changes,
            restrictions, and compatibility issues in this release of Compaq C.
            This file is named CC064.RELEASE_NOTES and has been placed in
            SYS$HELP:.

            This file contains information valuable to Compaq C programmers.
            Please inform your user community of this file's existence.

              10.Choose the IVP option.

                 The installation procedure asks if you want to run the
                 IVP. The IVP for Compaq C checks to be sure that the
                 installation is successful. It is recommended that you
                 run the IVP by answering YES to the following prompt:

                 This kit contains an Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
                 to verify the correct installation of Compaq C.  The IVP will
                 be left in:

                         SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST]DECC$IVP.COM

                 After the installation is complete, you can invoke the command
                 file at any time to verify that Compaq C is installed and
                 working correctly.

                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

                 After Compaq C is installed, you can run the IVP
                 independently to verify that the software is available
                 on your system. You might need to run the IVP after
                 a system failure to make sure that users can access
                 Compaq C.

              11.Choose the default for the CC command.

                 You will see the prompts described in this step only if
                 your system has a VAX C compiler installed.

                 The CC command is used to invoke either the VAX C
                 or Compaq C compiler. If your system has a VAX C
                 compiler already installed on it, you have the option
                 of specifying which compiler will be invoked by default
                 whenever just the CC command verb is used. To invoke
                 the compiler that is not the default, use the CC command
                 with the appropriate qualifier: /DECC for the Compaq C
                 compiler, or /VAXC for the VAX C compiler.

                 If VAX C is installed on your system, you can choose the
                 default to use for the CC command:






        2-8 Installing Compaq C

 







       A VAX C compiler was found on your system. The CC command will have
       the capability to invoke the Compaq C compiler via the command CC/DECC.
       The CC command will also have the capability to invoke the VAX C
       compiler via the command CC/VAXC. You have the choice of the CC
       command defaulting to execute either:
                     - the Compaq C compiler [DECC]
                     - the VAX C compiler [VAXC]
       If you choose DECC as the default, existing command files using CC to
       invoke VAX C may not work.  Other layered products expecting CC to
       invoke VAX C during their installation procedure may not install.

         * The default compiler when only CC is specified, VAXC or DECC [DECC]:

                 Either press Return to accept DECC as the default, or
                 enter VAXC.

                 If VAX C is not installed on the system, the following
                 information is displayed:

        VAX C is not installed on the system. Should you install VAX C at
        some future time, you must reinstall Compaq C to provide a command line
        definition for the CC command that can invoke either product.

              12.Purge files.

             * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

                 The directories SYS$HELP, SYS$MESSAGE, SYS$SYSTEM,
                 DECC$LIBRARY, and SYS$TEST may contain previous versions
                 of Compaq C files. These files are replaced during the
                 installation with new files, but the old files are not
                 automatically purged. Purging is recommended.

                 In response to the purging prompt, press Return to purge
                 the files or enter NO to keep them.

              13.Read informational messages.

                 At this point, the installation procedure displays a
                 number of informational messages that report on the
                 progress of the installation. There are no further
                 questions. If the installation procedure has been
                 successful up to this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new
                 or modified files to their target directories, updates
                 help files, and updates DCL tables, if necessary. If you
                 chose to have files purged, that work is done now. The
                 following messages are displayed:

                                                  Installing Compaq C 2-9

 






            You have answered all of the questions for this installation.  The
            installation will now execute in 10 to 60 minutes without further
            intervention, depending on your configuration, installation media,
            and so forth.

            The C Runtime Library headers and Starlet headers are installed as
            a Text Library (.TLB).  The traditional text form  of the headers
            (.H files) are also provided for  reference  purposes only) in
            the directories: SYS$COMMON:[DECC$LIB.REFERENCE.DECC$RTLDEF] and
            SYS$COMMON:[DECC$LIB.REFERENCE.SYS$STARLET_C].

            Please note that the compiler does not search the reference areas
            SYS$COMMON:[DECC$LIB.REFERENCE.DECC$RTLDEF] and
            SYS$COMMON:[DECC$LIB.REFERENCE.SYS$STARLET_C] during compilation.
            Instead headers are taken from the text library.

            %VMSINSTAL-I-SYSDIR, This product creates system disk directory
                                                       VMI$ROOT:[SYSTEST.DECC].

                     Your OpenVMS system will now be updated to include the
                     following new and modified files:

                     [SYSEXE]DECC$COMPILER.EXE              [new]

                     [SYSTEST.DECC]DECC$IVP*.*              [new]

               The file SYS$STARTUP:DECC$STARTUP.COM contains commands to be
               executed at system startup to allow for the best compilation
               performance.  You may want to invoke this command file from your
               system's site specific startup file. This command file does not
               have to be invoked for correct operation of Compaq C.

              14.Observe the IVP.

                 If you chose to run the IVP, VMSINSTAL now invokes the
                 IVP to verify that Compaq C was installed successfully:

                 When the installation is complete, you can choose to
                 install more products or to log out (as shown here).
                 If you removed any media from the console drive before
                 beginning the installation, you should replace it now.

                 Be aware that VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries
                 in the process symbol tables during the installation.
                 Therefore, if you are going to continue using the system
                 manager's account and you want to restore these symbols,
                 you should log out and log in again.

        2.2 Error Recovery

              If errors occur during the installation itself or when
              the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is running,
              VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
              fails, you see the following message:

           %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of Compaq C V6.n has failed.

              If the IVP fails, you see these messages:

              The Compaq C V6.n Installation Verification Procedure failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for Compaq C V6.n has failed.

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exist:

              o  The operating system version is incorrect.

              o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  System parameter values for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

              o  The product license has not been registered and loaded.

              For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
              conditions, see the OpenVMS documentation on system
              messages, recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software
              installation. If you are notified that any of these
              conditions exist, you should take the appropriate action as
              described in the message. For information on installation
              requirements, see Section 1.5.

              If the installation fails, you must restart the
              installation procedure from step 2 in Section 2.1. For
              an explanation of any system messages, see the OpenVMS
              System Messages and Recovery Procedures Reference Manual
              or the online HELP/MESSAGE facility. If the installation
              fails due to an IVP failure, contact a Compaq field service
              representative.

                                                                        3
        _________________________________________________________________

                                                After Installing Compaq C


              Compaq C is now installed and can be invoked by all users
              with the CC command.

              The installation procedure modifies the DCL command table
              so that the CC command is recognized and processed.
              However, the previous command table is still in effect
              for those users who are currently logged in. All logged-in
              users who want to use the CC command must log out and log
              in again, or use the following DCL command:

              $ SET COMMAND /TABLES=SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES

              You can perform the following system management tasks after
              Compaq C is installed:

              o  Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
                 separately

              o  Editing the system startup and shutdown files

              o  Modifying system parameter settings

              o  Making the product usable on a VAXcluster

              o  Setting user account quotas

              o  Tailoring your system

              o  Enhancing performance

              o  Reporting problems

        3.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

              You usually run the IVP during installation. If you want to
              run the Compaq C IVP separately to ensure the integrity of
              installed files should system problems occur, execute the
              following command procedure:

              $ @SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSTEST]DECC$IVP

                                            After Installing Compaq C 3-1

 







              If the IVP fails for any reason, the following message is
              displayed:

              Compaq C VERSION 6.n TEST FAILED

        3.2 Editing and Organizing System Files

              To provide for automatic startup of Compaq C when your
              system is rebooted, add the command line that starts
              Compaq C to the system startup file, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_
              VMS.COM (V5.0 and later) or SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM
              (V5.x systems):

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:CCXX$STARTUP.COM

              You must invoke this command procedure to define the
              logical names that the compiler needs to find the Compaq C
              header source files and any Compaq C++ class library header
              files.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                SYS$STARTUP:CCXX$STARTUP.COM initializes the Compaq C
                and Compaq C++ compile-time environment only.
                To initialize the DEC C/C++ Run-Time Components
                environment on applicable OpenVMS VAX systems,
                execute SYS$STARTUP:CRT$STARTUP.COM according to the
                instructions in the installation guide for that kit.

                ______________________________________________________

              If your system has DEC C++ for OpenVMS VAX Version 1.1
              installed, be sure to note the following changes and
              required actions:

              o  DEC C++ for OpenVMS VAX Version 1.2 has succeeded
                 Version 1.1. Compaq recommends that you upgrade to
                 Version 1.2, which has many problem fixes and a new
                 installation and startup procedure that cooperates with
                 the procedures used by this Compaq C installation.

              o  Beginning with DEC C++ for OpenVMS VAX Version 1.2
                 and and DEC C for OpenVMS VAX Version 4.0, the
                 default locations for the top-level directories
                 dev:[DECC$LIBRARY] and dev:[CXX$LIBRARY] have changed
                 to SYS$COMMON:[DECC$LIB] and SYS$COMMON:[CXX$LIB],
                 respectively.

        3-2 After Installing Compaq C

 







                 After installing DEC C for OpenVMS VAX Version 4.0 or
                 higher, the system logical DECC$LIBRARY_INCLUDE points
                 to a new header area. Therefore, if your system has
                 DEC C++ for OpenVMS VAX Version 1.1 installed, be sure
                 to take note of the old location before installing
                 Compaq C.

              o  With DEC C Version 4.0 and higher, the location for
                 the library form of the DEC C headers has changed from
                 that used in previous DEC C and DEC C++ versions. The
                 old location was dev:[DECC$LIBRARY.INCLUDE]. The new
                 location is SYS$LIBRARY.

              o  The DEC C Version 4.0 and higher startup is called
                 CCXX$STARTUP.COM and is shared by Compaq C and
                 Compaq C++. This startup file obsoletes both
                 CC$STARTUP.COM (used in previous test versions of DEC C)
                 and CXX$STARTUP.COM (if DEC C++ for OpenVMS VAX Version
                 1.1 is installed on your system).

                 Delete CC$STARTUP.COM and CXX$STARTUP.COM and remove
                 them from SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_xxx.COM.

                 As a reminder to do this, the Compaq C installation
                 creates stub copies of both CC$STARTUP.COM and
                 CXX$STARTUP.COM that do nothing but announce that the
                 old versions of these files are obsolete and should be
                 deleted.

              In summary, unless you want to reuse the obsolete default
              directories for DECC$LIBRARY_INCLUDE, you should remove
              the following files from the old areas (dev is selected
              during DEC C++ Version 1.1 installation; it defaults to
              SYS$SYSDEVICE):

              dev:[DECC$LIBRARY...]*.*;*
              dev:[000000]DECC$LIBRARY.dir;*
              SYS$STARTUP:CXX$STARTUP.COM
              SYS$STARTUP:CC$STARTUP.COM
              SYS$COMMON[SYSTEST.DECC...]*.*;*

                                            After Installing Compaq C 3-3

 







              If you are installing the DEC C Version 4.0 (or higher)
              files into the same areas as you chose for the C header
              files when installing DEC C++ Version 1.1, you can either
              delete the entire directory tree dev:[DECC$LIBRARY...]
              before installing the new version, or delete only the
              following files after installing Compaq C:

              SYS$STARTUP:CXX$STARTUP.COM;*
              SYS$STARTUP:CC$STARTUP.COM;*
              dev:[DECC$LIBRARY.SYSTEM]*.*;*
              dev:[DECC$LIBRARY]SYSTEM.dir;*
              dev:[DECC$LIBRARY.CRTL]*.*;*
              dev:[DECC$LIBRARY]CRTL.dir;*
              dev:[DECC$LIBRARY.INCLUDE]DECC$RTLDEF.TLB_OLD;*
              SYS$COMMON[SYSTEST.DECC...]*.*;*
              SYS$COMMON[SYSTEST]DECC.dir;*

              If you have a system logical or one or more options files
              that point to the old linker and the old run-time libraries
              (RTLs) that resided in dev:[CXX$LIBRARY.SYSTEM]LINK.EXE and
              dev:[DECC$LIBRARY.CRTL]*.*, you should remove them. That
              linker is obsolete and the RTLs are made obsolete by the
              DEC C/C++ Run-Time Components Version 6.0 for OpenVMS VAX
              kit (or by your Version 6.0 or later OpenVMS VAX system).

        3.3 VAXcluster Considerations

              If you want to run Compaq C on multiple nodes of a
              VAXcluster, first check to see that you have the
              appropriate software license (see Section 1.4). Then
              perform the following steps after you install Compaq C:

              1. Enter the LICENSE LOAD command, as described in the
                 OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual, to activate
                 the license on each node in the VAXcluster on which
                 Compaq C is to be executed.

              2. Log in to the installation node and use the OpenVMS
                 INSTALL Utility to determine whether DECC$COMPILER.EXE
                 is a known image:

                 $ INSTALL
                 INSTALL> LIST SYS$SYSTEM:DECC$COMPILER.EXE


        3-4 After Installing Compaq C

 







                 If the output of the preceding LIST command shows
                 DECC$COMPILER.EXE to be a known image, perform all
                 of the following steps. Otherwise, perform all of the
                 following steps except step 5.

              3. Log in to a node on the cluster.

              4. Update the DCL tables on all nodes, if enough global
                 pages are available:

          SYSMAN>SET ENV/CLUSTER
          SYSMAN>DO -
   IF F$GETSYI("CONTIG_GBLPAGES").GT.F$FILE("SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES.EXE","EOF") -
          THEN INSTALL REPLACE SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES

              5. If DECC$COMPILER.EXE was established as a known image
                 using the INSTALL utility, enter the following commands:

                    $INSTALL
                    INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$SYSTEM:DECC$COMPILER.EXE

                 This command replaces the INSTALL entry for
                 DECC$COMPILER.EXE.

                 Repeat this step only for those nodes of the cluster on
                 which you activated the Compaq C license in step 1. (In
                 most cases, all the nodes will be licensed.)

        3.4 User Account Requirements

              To work with Compaq C, user accounts on your system must
              have certain privileges and quotas. The following sections
              contain information on these requirements.

        3.4.1 Privileges

              To use Compaq C, each account must have at least the TMPMBX
              and NETMBX privileges. Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility to
              determine whether users have the privileges they require.

        3.4.2 User Account Quotas

              To use Compaq C, a user account does not need to meet
              any special quota requirements. However, for users who
              will be compiling very large programs (many program units
              compiled together), consider adjusting working set (WSDEF,
              WSQUOTA, WSEXTENT) and pagefile (PGFLQUOTA) account quotas
              to improve performance.

                                            After Installing Compaq C 3-5

 







              See Section 1.5.2 for a description of how to verify and
              change account quotas.

        3.5 Enhancing Compaq C Performance

              The following sections include information on system tuning
              and explain how to install Compaq C as a shared image.

        3.5.1 Tuning Your System

              After you install Compaq C, you might want to adjust your
              system to enhance performance or lower the use of some
              system resources. Information about tuning your system is
              included in the Guide to OpenVMS Performance Management.

        3.5.2 Installing Compaq C as a Shared Image

              If you expect Compaq C to be used extensively on your
              system, you can reduce the system overhead and memory
              requirements by installing it as a shared image.

              To install Compaq C as a shared image on a system that
              is currently running, use the OpenVMS INSTALL utility. We
              recommend that you install Compaq C as shared on a system
              that has been rebooted recently, because the available
              space in the global page table is less likely to be
              fragmented.

              To install Compaq C as a shared image:

              1. Make sure your system has the required number of
                 available global pages and global sections. See
                 Section 1.5.3.1.

              2. After you have reset the system parameter values, invoke
                 the OpenVMS INSTALL utility from a privileged account
                 and install Compaq C as a shared image by entering the
                 following commands:

                 $ INSTALL
          INSTALL> ADD SYS$SYSTEM:DECC$COMPILER.EXE/OPEN/SHARED/HEADER_RESIDENT
          INSTALL> ADD SYS$MESSAGE:DECC$MSG_SHR.EXE/OPEN/SHARED/HEADER_RESIDENT
          INSTALL> EXIT


        3-6 After Installing Compaq C

 







              3. Add the following lines to the appropriate system
                 startup command file so that Compaq C is available as
                 a shared image each time the system is started. (If your
                 site has modularized its startup procedures, be sure you
                 add the lines to the correct file.) The default startup
                 command file for OpenVMS Version 5.5-2, for example, is
                 SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM.

                 $ INSTALL
                 ADD SYS$SYSTEM:DECC$COMPILER.EXE/OPEN/SHARED/HEADER_RESIDENT
                 ADD SYS$MESSAGE:DECC$MSG_SHR.EXE/OPEN/SHARED/HEADER_RESIDENT
                 EXIT

              When you install Compaq C as a shared image you need to
              increase the global pages and global sections parameters as
              described in Section 1.5.3.1.

        3.6 Getting Help and Reporting Problems

              If an error occurs while Compaq C is in use and you believe
              the error is caused by a problem with the product, please
              report it to Compaq.

              If you have a Software Product Services Support Agreement,
              contact your Customer Support Center (CSC) by telephone or
              by using the electronic means provided with your support
              agreement (such as DSNlink). The CSC provides telephone
              support for high-level advisory and remedial assistance.
              When you initially contact the CSC, indicate the following:

              o  The name and version number of the operating system you
                 are using

              o  The version number of Compaq C you are using

              o  The hardware system you are using (such as a model
                 number)

              o  A brief description of the problem (one sentence if
                 possible)

              o  How critical the problem is

              Whether you submit information electronically or contact
              the appropriate support specialist by telephone, please
              take the following steps:

              1. Describe as accurately as possible the circumstances
                 and state of the system when the problem occurred.

                                            After Installing Compaq C 3-7

 







                 Include the description and version number of the
                 Compaq C compiler being used. Demonstrate the problem
                 with specific examples.

              2. Reduce the problem to as small a size as possible.

              3. Remember to include listings of any command files,
                 INCLUDE files, or relevant data files, and so forth.

              4. Provide a listing of the program.

              5. If the program is longer than 50 lines, submit a copy
                 of it on machine-readable media (diskette or magnetic
                 tape).

              6. Report only one problem per report. This will facilitate
                 a faster response.

              7. Mail the problem report to Compaq.

              If the problem is related to Compaq C documentation, you
              can report the problem to the CSC (if you have a Software
              Product Services Support Agreement and the problem is
              severe); otherwise, send your comments about Compaq C
              documentation to the following Internet address:

              c_docs@compaq.com

                                                     Sample Installations


              This appendix contains sample installations of the
              components on the Compaq C kit. Be aware that this is only
              a sample. Sometimes the installation procedure is modified
              in maintenance updates of this product.

              Because this installation guide is not always revised
              for maintenance updates, be sure to read the Read Before
              Installing Compaq C for OpenVMS VAX Systems, Version 6.n
              letter before you install this product. This letter notes
              any significant changes to the installation samples shown
              here.

              Depending on which layered products you have on your
              system, you might see additional messages and questions
              when you perform your installation.

              The sample installations assume that DECnet has been shut
              down, and that no users are logged on to your system. The
              Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs at the end
              of the installations.

             The C Runtime Library headers and Starlet headers are installed as
             a Text Library (.TLB).  The traditional text form  of the headers
             (.H files) is also provided (for  reference  purposes only) in
             the directories: SYS$COMMON:[DECC$LIB.REFERENCE.DECC$RTLDEF] and
             SYS$COMMON:[DECC$LIB.REFERENCE.SYS$STARLET_C].

             Please note that the compiler does not search the reference areas
             SYS$COMMON:[DECC$LIB.REFERENCE.DECC$RTLDEF] and
             SYS$COMMON:[DECC$LIB.REFERENCE.SYS$STARLET_C] during compilation.
             Instead headers are taken from the text library.

                  Please add SYS$STARTUP:CCXX$STARTUP.COM to the system startup

        A.2 Upgrade Installation

              This sample was run on a system that had a previous version
              of Compaq C installed. The system is upgraded to the
              new version of the compiler, which becomes the default
              compiler. The old compiler is retained as an alternative
              compiler.

        A.3 Installation with Old Compiler as Default

              This sample was run on a system that had a previous version
              of Compaq C installed. In this sample, the new version of
              the compiler is installed, but the previous version of the
              compiler is kept and made the default compiler.

              The installation procedure prompts you to designate one of
              the compiler versions as the system default compiler. See
              Section 1.6 for more information on installing and using
              multiple compiler versions.
