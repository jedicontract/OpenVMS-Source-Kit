    product.

    Installation Information

    The installation kit accompanying this letter contains the save
    set AACRT060.A, which is required for installing DEC C/C++ Run-
    Time Components Version 6.0 for OpenVMS VAX. This run-time support
    is required for the proper execution of applications on end-user
    systems that were built using the DEC C or DEC C++ languages or
    their associated facilities. Installation of the kit requires

    When the DEC C/C++ Run-Time Components kit is installed on an
    OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5, 5.5-1, or 5.5-2 system, some of the
    shareable image run-time components replace older versions of
    existing OpenVMS components. Prior to the installation you should
    read Chapter 1 of the
    DEC C/C++ Run-Time Components for OpenVMS VAX Reference and In-
    stallation Guide.

    Installing this product requires OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5 or
    higher.
