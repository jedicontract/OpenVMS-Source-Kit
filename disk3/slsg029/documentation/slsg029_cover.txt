                                                               AV-Q8MFR-TE

          Dear Customer:

          To continue our tradition of providing enhanced Storage Manage-
          ment Software (SMS) capabilities to our customers, Compaq offers
          a maintenance release of the Compaq Storage Library System for
          OpenVMS[TM], Version 2.9G software.

          Storage Library System (SLS) for OpenVMS, Version 2.9G software
          runs on OpenVMS VAX Versions 6.2, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 and on Open-
          VMS, Alpha Versions 6.2, 7.1-2, 7.2-1, 7.2-2, 7.3 and 7.3-1.
          Versions listed are attempts to be current with the Operating
          System. Ultimately the contract between customer and the OpenVMS
          organization takes precedent.

          You can use SLS, Version 2.9G in a mixed-architecture OpenVMS
          VAX and Alpha environment.

                                        NOTE

             For SLS customers continuing to utilize OpenVMS VAX Ver-
             sion 5.5-2, stay on SLS Version 2.9F.

          SLS Version 2.9G is a combination of a bug fix release, and
          includes qualification for OpenVMS V7.3 VAX and V7.3-1 Alpha and
          adds new devices since the SLS 2.9F release.

          OpenVMS Versions 7.2-2, 7.3 and 7.3-1 provides support for
          Fibre Channel (FC) connected tape devices. This is accomplished
          through the use of Modular Data Router (MDR) or Network Storage
          Router (NSR) connected to the FC Switch. Both routers convert
          Fibre Channel protocol to SCSI protocol, which the attached
          tape device understands. SLS V2.9G has been qualified Fibre
          Channel connected devices as outlined/listed in the OpenVMS
          7.3-1 SPD 25.01.66. SLS V2.9G is restricted to a single cluster
          environment. See Install guide for more information.

          Please refer to OpenVMS V7.3 SPD(s) for a complete listing of
          supported tape devices.

          The SLS and MDMS V2.9G release notes contain a more detailed
          listing of bug fixes. The SLS Software Product Description (SPD)
          updates qualified devices for this release.
