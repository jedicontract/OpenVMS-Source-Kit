                   Introduction to the Storage Library System for OpenVMS


              This chapter defines the role of Compaq's Storage Library
              System for OpenVMS (SLS) software product in storage
              management.

        1.1 What is SLS?

              Storage Library System for OpenVMS (SLS) is a layered
              software product that provides support for saving copies
              of data and restoring those copies as necessary.

                _______________________ Warning _______________________

                Due to changes in functionality and database
                structure, SLS software versions 2.5B and later
                are incompatible with SLS software version 2.4A and
                earlier. If you are an existing SLS customer, and
                upgrade SLS on your server node to version 2.5 or
                higher, then you must also upgrade each of your client
                nodes to version 2.5 or higher. This requirement
                results from a change in the format of the common
                magazine database in SLS software version V2.5B.

                ______________________________________________________

              Storage administrators face three primary storage
              management problems that SLS software helps to solve:

              o  Ensuring data is available in the event of a disaster

              o  Maintaining data in some form for regulatory and legal
                 purposes

              o  Providing sufficient online storage space to meet users'
                 needs

        1.2 Mixed Architecture Environments

                _ Before You Install your Storage Management Software _

                If you are planning to install SLS software in a mixed
                architecture OpenVMS Cluster, you should understand
                the configuration issues explained in this section.
                If you do not consider these configuration issues,
                you could spend considerable time deleting and editing
                files, and reinstalling the software.

                ______________________________________________________

              This section addresses the characteristics of a mixed
              architecture environment and describes some fundamental
              approaches to installing and configuring your software to
              run in it. The following list identifies the topics and
              their purposes

              o  Section 1.2.1 defines the mixed architecture environment
                 and discusses ways in which they can come about, change,
                 then disappear. Each of these occurrences requires some
                 consideration about how to configure your software.

              o  Section 1.2.2 lists the guiding principles that
                 require you to make special considerations for mixed
                 architecture implementation, and what these principles
                 mean to you.

              o  Section 1.2.3 describes three possible approaches to
                 implementing a mixed architecture environment.

              o  Section 1.2.4 explains why the documentation includes
                 procedures for a specific approach. If you cannot use
                 the documented procedures, you should decide on an
                 approach before you begin installation.

                                      1.2 Mixed Architecture Environments


        1.2.1 Mixed Architecture Environments

              A mixed architecture OpenVMS Cluster includes at least one
              VAX system and at least one Alpha system.

              Creating_a_Mixed_Architecture_Configuration:

              If you add an Alpha system to a homogenous VAX OpenVMS
              Cluster, or if you are currently running a homogenous Alpha
              OpenVMS Cluster and inherit a VAX system, you will have a
              mixed architecture environment.

              Before you integrate the Alpha or VAX node into the system,
              you should decide an approach to take for handling mixed
              architecture issues.

              Operating_a_Mixed_Architecture_Configuration:

              If you are currently operating a mixed architecture
              environment, and you want to add a VAX system or an
              Alpha system you must integrate it into your current
              configuration consistently with your other applications.

              You should understand the particular requirements of any
              new application you introduce into a mixed architecture
              OpenVMS Cluster.

              Dissolving_a_Mixed_Architecture_Configuration:

              If you remove the last VAX or Alpha system, leaving a
              homogenous OpenVMS Cluster, you should remove any aspects
              of configuration that accounted for the heterogenous nature
              of the mixed architecture system. This includes (but is
              not limited to) removing startup files, duplicate directory
              structures, and logical tables.

        1.2.2 Principles Guiding Mixed Architecture Configuration

              Limitations:

              VAX systems cannot execute image files compiled on an Alpha
              system, and Alpha systems cannot execute image files
              compiled on a VAX system. Other types of files cannot
              be shared, including object code files (.OBJ), and user
              interface description files (.UID). You must place files
              that cannot be shared in different locations: VAX files
              accessible only to VAX OpenVMS Cluster nodes, and Alpha
              files accessible only to Alpha OpenVMS Cluster nodes.

        Introduction to the Storage Library System for OpenVMS
        1.2 Mixed Architecture Environments


              Data files, in most cases, must be shared between OpenVMS
              Cluster nodes. You should place all shared files in
              directories accessible by both VAX and Alpha OpenVMS
              Cluster nodes.

              Logical names, that reference files which cannot be shared,
              or the directories in which they reside, must be defined
              differently on VAX and Alpha systems.

              Files that assign logical name values must therefore be
              architecture specific. Such files may either reside on
              node-specific disks or shared only among OpenVMS Cluster
              nodes of the same hardware architecture.

        1.2.3 Configuring Applications in a Mixed Architecture OpenVMS
              Cluster

              This section describes three approaches to configuring
              applications to run in a mixed architecture OpenVMS
              Cluster. The one you choose depends on your existing
              configuration, and the needs of the particular application
              you are installing. These approaches are given as examples
              only. You should decide which you want to implement based
              on your own situation and style of system management.

              All of these approaches have two aspects in common:

              o  All shared files reside in one location

              o  All files that cannot be shared reside in separate
                 locations

        1.2.3.1 Separate Disk Configuration

              These characteristics describe the separate disk
              configuration:

              o  Product directories are installed on two separate disks.

              o  One of the product directories is a complete
                 installation containing all data (and other shared)
                 files, and all executable (and other nonshared) files
                 for either VAX or Alpha systems.

              o  The other of the product directories is a partial
                 product installation, with only those directories that
                 contain either Alpha or VAX system executables and other
                 nonshared files.

                                      1.2 Mixed Architecture Environments


              o  The systems using the disk with the complete
                 installation uses logicals that normally reference the
                 product executables and shared files.

              o  The systems using the disk with only the nonshared
                 files use normal product logical definitions to point
                 to shared files and directories. System logicals that
                 point to nonshared files are assigned to the specific
                 device, directory and/or file names.

        1.2.3.2 Separate Root Configuration

              These characteristics describe the separate root
              configuration:

              o  Product directories are installed on the same disk, but
                 at different root locations.

              o  One of the product directories is a complete
                 installation containing all data (and other shared
                 files), and all executable (and other nonshared) files
                 for either VAX or Alpha systems.

              o  The other of the product directories is a partial
                 product installation, with only those subdirectories
                 that contain either Alpha or VAX system executables and
                 other nonshared files.

              o  The systems using the directory with the complete
                 installation uses logicals that normally reference the
                 product executables and shared files.

              o  The systems using the directory with only the nonshared
                 files use normal product logical definitions to point to
                 shared files and directories. System logicals that point
                 to nonshared files are assigned to the specific device,
                 directory and/or file names.

        1.2.3.3 Separate Subdirectory Configuration

              These characteristics describe the separate directory
              configuration:

              o  Product directories are installed on the same disk, and
                 under the same root.

              o  Any directory which would normally contain the nonshared
                 files (under a single architecture installation) has two
                 subdirectories: one for VAX system nonshared files, and
                 one for Alpha system nonshared files.

        Introduction to the Storage Library System for OpenVMS
        1.2 Mixed Architecture Environments


              o  Logicals that reference nonshared files are assigned
                 search list values that point to the directories which
                 holds shared files, and to the architecture specific
                 subdirectories holding nonshared files.

        1.2.4 Implementation Specific Approach

              recommended approach based on current product configuration
              and the behavior of the installation software with respect
              to its use of logical definitions during upgrades.

              If the recommended approach is inconsistent with the way
              you currently manage your system, you should decide on
              a different approach before you begin your installation
              procedures.

              This chapter explains preinstallation requirements for
              SLS.

        2.1 Preinstallation Process

              This section describes what you need to do before you run
              the SLS, Version 2.9G installation procedure. Table 2-1
              identifies actions you need to take to prepare for
              installing the SLS, Version 2.9G server software (which
              provides all SLS functionality) or client software (which
              provides most SLS functionality, except for the media
              databases). Later sections of this chapter provide details.


                ___________ Important - during Installation ___________

                Installing SLS Version 2.9G requires DECnet to be
                enabled throughout the process. Before you begin
                installing make sure DECnet is enabled.

              3     Check that the system on which you intend to install
                    SLS meets hardware and software requirements.

              ___________________________________________________________
              4     Shut down previous versions of SLS software on all
                    nodes of the cluster on which SLS software will be
                    installed.

              ___________________________________________________________
              5     Delete all existing SLS jobs from batch queues. If
                    you do not, the jobs will try to run using the old
                    SYSBAK.COM and will fail.

        2.2 Configuring Your Hardware

                ________________ MDMS Component of SLS ________________

                The hardware configuration activities described in
                these sections refer to MDMS, which is an integral
                component of SLS.

                ______________________________________________________

              This section describes how to configure automated media
              libraries, media loaders, and operator attended drives to
              enable MDMS to provide a managed media environment. This
              means installing, connecting, and testing the tape drives.

              Each procedure depends on the kind of tape drive that
              you plan to use. Use the procedures appropriate for the
              tape drives you plan to include in the managed media
              environment:

              o  For an automated media library, refer to Section 2.2.1.

              o  For a media loader, refer to Section 2.2.2.

              o  For an operator attended drvie, refer to Section 2.2.3.

                                            2.2 Configuring Your Hardware


        2.2.1 Hardware Configuration For an Automated Media Library

              The following procedure applies to the installation and
              testing of an automated media library. Configuration and
              testing of MDMS to manage an automated media library is
              described in Chapter 4.

        2.2.1.1 Hardware Installation

              During this procedure, refer to the drive-specific hardware
              installation procedure information for details. The
              following procedure provides only the basic steps necessary
              to later configure MDMS against the drive:

              1. Install and connect the hardware. Apply power to the
                 drives.

              2. If you are using an HSx controller, configure it to
                 allow the OpenVMS system to communicate with the drives.

              3. Make note of the drive name after you complete your
                 connection procedure. You will need this, especially if
                 you are going to use the Media Robot Utility software.

        2.2.1.2 Test the Hardware

              With an automated media library, use a utility such as the
              Media Robot Utility (MRU) or use the front panel of the
              drive and the OpenVMS system to test the connection between
              the host and drive.

              Use the following procedure to test the hardware connection
              between the automated tape library and the OpenVMS system:

              1. Verify the robot device name and the drive names located
                 in the automatic tape library.

                 Issue the DCL SHOW DEVICE command and/or the ROBOT SHOW
                 ROBOT command. If there is a problem with drive name or
                 the connection, it becomes apparent here.

                 $ SHOW DEVICE [drive-name[:]]

                 The following is the StorageWorks Media Robot Utility
                 command for examining the robot:

                 $ ROBOT SHOW ROBOT [robot_name]

                 If you have problems with the drive name, refer to the
                 OpenVMS system and drive-specific hardware documentation
                 for remedial action.

              2. Place a volume in the robot.

              3. Inject the volume through a port on the robot by
                 using the front panel controls or, if you are using
                 StorageWorks Media Robot Utility, by issuing the ROBOT
                 INJECT command:

                 $ ROBOT INJECT [PORT port_number] SLOT slot_number [ROBOT robot_name]

                 Alternately, you can expose the internal storage slots
                 and place the volume directly into the robot. You also
                 should consider placing one or more cleaning volumes
                 into the robot at this time.

              4. Load the volume into the drive by using the front panel
                 controls or, if you are using MRU, by issuing the ROBOT
                 SHOW and ROBOT LOAD command:

                 $ ROBOT SHOW SLOT 0-n [ROBOT robot_name]
                 $ ROBOT LOAD SLOT slot_num [ROBOT robot_name]

              5. After loading the volume, check the OpenVMS system
                 connection to the drive by mounting and dismounting
                 the volume.

                 Mount the volume foreign:

                 $ MOUNT/FOREIGN/NOASSIST drive_name[:]

                 Dismount the volume:

                 $ DISMOUNT drive_name[:]

              6. Remove the volume from the drive by using the front
                 panel controls or, if you are using MRU, by issuing the
                 ROBOT UNLOAD command:

                 $ ROBOT UNLOAD SLOT slot_number [ROBOT robot_name]

              After having completed this procedure, the volume remains
              in the robot but is not loaded in the drive.

        2.2.2 Hardware Configuration for a Media Loader

              The following procedure applies to the installation and
              testing of a media loader. Configuration and testing of
              MDMS to manage a media loader is described in Chapter 4.

              1. Install and connect the hardware. Apply power to the
                 drives.

              2. If you are using an HSx controller, configure it to
                 allow the OpenVMS system to communicate with the drives.

              3. Make note of the drive name after you complete your
                 connection procedure. You will need this, especially if
                 you are going to use the Media Robot Utility software.

        2.2.2.2 Test the Hardware

              With a media loader, use a utility such as the Media Robot
              Utility (MRU) or use the front panel of the drive and the
              OpenVMS system to test the connection between the OpenVMS
              system and drive.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Before you perform this procedure, you must have a
                compatible, initialized volume in the robot. Use this
                initialized volume to perform this test.

                ______________________________________________________

              Use the following procedure to test the hardware connection
              between the tape loader and the OpenVMS system:

              1. Verify the changer device name and the drive names.

                 Issue the DCL SHOW DEVICE command and/or the ROBOT SHOW
                 ROBOT command. If there is a problem with drive name or
                 the connection, it becomes apparent here:

                 $ SHOW DEVICE [drive-name[:]]

                 The following is the MRU command for examining the
                 robot:

                 $ ROBOT SHOW ROBOT [robot_name]

                 If you have problems with the drive name, refer to
                 the drive-specific hardware documentation for remedial

        2.5 Client and Server Definitions

              This section introduces SLS's concepts of client software
              and server software. You need to understand these
              distinctions before you install the SLS software on your
              system.

        2.5.1 Server Software

              SLS server software gives users access to the full
              functionality of SLS software. SLS provides this access
              at the node or OpenVMScluster system where the SLS software
              is executing. You install SLS server software on the server
              node.

              SLS server software manages the:

              o  Media database-A set of RMS files that describe all
                 removable storage media known to SLS software. These
                 files are part of the Media and Device Management
                 Services for OpenVMS (MDMS) portion of the SLS product.
                 For detailed information about the MDMS databases, see
                 the Media and Device Management Services for OpenVMS
                 Guide to Operations.

                 A node or OpenVMScluster system executing SLS server
                 software provides media management services both for
                 itself and for any client nodes connected to it. The
                 media database contains information about volume names,
                 locations, magazines, tape jukeboxes, and pool access
                 authorization.

              o  SLS history files-Information is recorded at the local
                 node about user files backed up or archived under SLS
                 control.

              Requirement:

              To use the SLS product, you must have at least one SLS
              server license in the network.

        Before Installing SLS
        2.5 Client and Server Definitions


        2.5.2 Client Software

              SLS client software:

              o  Provides backup scheduling and archiving services
                 for the node or OpenVMScluster system on which it is
                 executing

              o  Acts as a client of another node executing SLS server
                 software when it requires media management services

              o  Provides users with full functionality when a node or
                 OpenVMScluster system executing SLS client software is
                 communicating with another node or OpenVMScluster system
                 executing SLS server software

              Similar to the SLS server software, SLS client software
              also maintains history files in which it records
              information about user files backed up or archived locally
              under its control.

              The node executing SLS client software communicates
              using DECnet software to a server node running SLS server
              software. The server node maintains the media database.

              Requirement:

              To use media management services, each SLS client node
              must be connected to a server node executing SLS server
              software. Any number of SLS client nodes may be connected
              to a single SLS server node.

        2.6 Software Requirements

              The following software is required to install either SLS,
              Version 2.9G server or client software:

              o  OpenVMS VAX operating system, Version 6.2, 7.1, 7.2
                 or 7.3 or OpenVMS Alpha operating system, Version 6.2,
                 7.1-2, 7.2-1, 7.3 or 7.3-1

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Storage Library System for OpenVMS, Version 2.9G
                software is not supported on systems running OpenVMS,
                Version 7.0 operating system software.

                 [PTHREAD]PTHREAD$DBGSHR.EXE  -  V72R / V7.2 / V7.2

              This patch must be installed to help SLS flag the actual
              status-at-exit of any storage command, and make a graceful
              exit from the command upon its completion. Without this
              patch all error messages issued by SLS will be masked
              and the exit status will always be 'Normal Successful
              Completion'. This will cause all the SLS command procedures
              that check for 'status after a storage command' to
              malfunction because of the pseudo 'success status' even
              in case of a failure.

        2.6.2 Server Software Requirements

              Before you install the server software, check to see
              that the DECnet software and the OpenVMS Queue Manager
              are running. If they are not running, follow the steps in
              Table 2-3 to start them.

              Table_2-3_How_to_Start_DECnet_and_OpenVMS_Queue_Manager____

              Step__Action_______________________________________________

              1     Start the DECnet software. Enter the following
                    command at the DCL prompt:

                    $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET

              ___________________________________________________________

              ______$_START/QUEUE/MANAGER________________________________

        2.6.3 Client Software Requirements

              Before you install client software, the node on which
              you intend to install the SLS client software must be
              registered on the SLS server node. If it is not, the IVP
              fails. For more information, see Section 4.3.3.

        2.6.4 Optional Software

              o  DCSC (Digital Cartridge Server Component)

                 If you have a StorageTek Automated Cartridge Server
                 (ACS[TM]), you must install the DCSC software

              o  RDF (Remote Device Facility)

                 SLS, Version 2.9G software provides optional
                 installation of Remote Device Facility (RDF) software.
                 During installation of the SLS software, you are asked
                 if you want to access tape devices on a remote system or
                 if you want to allow remote backups to tape devices on
                 this system. RDF software is installed automatically if
                 you answer YES to either question.

        2.7 Shutting Down the Previous Version of SLS Software

              If you are running a previous version of SLS, then shut
              down SLS on all nodes in the cluster before installing the
              new version of SLS server or client software.

        Before Installing SLS
        2.7 Shutting Down the Previous Version of SLS Software


              Shut down the SLS software with the following command:

              $ @SLS$SYSTEM:SLS$SHUTDOWN

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Due to changes in functionality and database
                structure, SLS software versions 2.5B and 2.6 are
                incompatible with SLS software version 2.4A or
                earlier. If you are an existing SLS customer, and
                upgrade SLS on your server node to version 2.5 or
                higher, then you must also upgrade each of your client
                nodes to version 2.5 or higher. This requirement
                results from a change in the format of the common
                magazine database in SLS software version V2.5B.

                ______________________________________________________

              You might also need to check the batch queues to see if any
              SLS jobs exist. If so, you need to delete the existing SLS
              jobs from the batch queues.

        2.8 Registering the SLS Software License

              If you are installing SLS server or client software for the
              first time, you must register the SLS software license.

              The following sections describe:

              o  License and kit names

              o  How to unload a previous license

              o  How to register the server or client software license

        2.8.1 License and Kit Names

              Refer to Table 2-4 for the license and kit names for the
              server or client software.

              the steps in Table 2-5 to unload the current SLS software
              license. After completing this procedure, you may register
              the new SLS server or client software license.

              Appendix A.

                ___________________ Recommendation ___________________

                We recommend you perform a backup of your system disk
                before you install SLS software. Refer to the OpenVMS
                Backup Utility Manual for more details.

                ______________________________________________________

                _____________ Note: Version Compatibility _____________

                SLS Version 2.9G software (client and server) is
                not compatible with any previous versions of SLS
                prior to version 2.5. If any node in a client-server
                configuration is running a version later than 2.5,
                then all nodes in the configuration must be running
                the same version or higher. An exception can be made
                if none of the SLS nodes serve a SLS$MAGAZINE_MASTER_
                FILE.DAT datbase.

        3.3 Configuring SLS in a Mixed Architecture Environment

              Compaq recommends configuring SLS according to the
              approach outlined in Section 1.2.3.2. The steps outlined
              in Table 3-3 implement that approach.

                  3.3 Configuring SLS in a Mixed Architecture Environment


              This configuration assumes two installations: a primary
              installation for which all files and directories will
              be used, and a secondary installation for which only
              architecture-compatible executables or other nonshared
              files are located.

              With this installation, systems with logicals that point
              to shared locations must be defined to point to the primary
              installation file locations. This procedure describes how
              to change key logical definitions to point the primary
              installation files.

        3.3.1 How to Configure for a Mixed-Architecure Environment

              Table 3-3 shows the steps for configuring SLS in a mixed
              architecture OpenVMS Cluster system.

              1     Edit the SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM file logical
                    definitions on the secondary system so they point
                    to the primary installation files for

                    o  The SLS master database location

                       PRIMAST

              2     Edit SLS$SYSTEM:LOADER.COM on the secondary system

                                                     After Installing SLS


              After installing the SLS server or client software, you
              must prepare it for configuration. This chapter explains
              how to do the following post installation activities:

              o  Verifying the installation

              o  Making the SLS software available on a systemwide basis

              o  Defining a network object on an OpenVMScluster system
                 (server software only)

              o  Upgrading SLS to comply with changes to OpenVMS version

              o  Upgrading from a previous version of SLS software

              o  Configuring media and device support for SLS

              o  Configuring SLS for Remote Device Facility (RDF) support

        4.1 Verifying the Installation

              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) may be
              executed as part of the installation procedure by
              responding YES to the question

                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

              If you did not execute the IVP during the installation
              procedure, then execute it immediately after installing the
              SLS software by entering the command:

              $ @SYS$TEST:SLS$IVP

              Requirements:

              o  The SLS software must be running on the system where the
                 IVP is executed.

              o  When executing the IVP on a SLS client node, the client
                 node must have access to the SLS server node.

                                                 After Installing SLS 4-1

        4.2 Editing the Systemwide Command Files


        4.2 Editing the Systemwide Command Files

              To ensure SLS functions properly, you need to edit the
              system startup procedure and the system login file.

        4.2.1 Automatically Starting SLS

              To ensure the SLS software starts up each time
              the system is booted, edit the system startup
              procedure, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM or
              SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM based on the OpenVMS Version.
              Add the following line:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:SLS$STARTUP

              Note:

              Include the startup line after the STARTNET command in the
              SYSTARTUP_x.COM file.

              If you are using DECnet-Plus, make sure the
              SLS$STARTUP command entry appears before the call
              @SYS$MANAGER:NET$NCP_APPLICATIONS.COM.

        4.2.2 Defining Global Symbols for SLS Users

              To define symbols for SLS software users, edit the system
              login file, SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM. Add the following
              line:

              $ @SYS$MANAGER:SLS$TAPSYMBOL

              Note:

              Include the symbol line in a section of the SYLOGIN.COM
              file that is executed by all accounts. If SLS$TAPSYMBOL.COM
              is not run, users will be unable to access the SLS menus.

        4.3 Preparing SLS Server Software

              If you have installed SLS server software for the first
              time, then you must:

              o  Define a network object on your OpenVMScluster system
                 nodes.

              o  Authorize SLS volume database and pool access.

        4.3.1 Defining a DECnet Network Object on an OpenVMScluster
              System

              Follow the steps in Table 4-1 to define the SLS$DBX NCP
              object.

              Requirement:

              If you intend to implement the high-availability features
              of SLS software, all nodes that participate in the
              OpenVMScluster system alias must have the SLS$DBX NCP
              object defined.

              Table_4-1_How_to_Define_the_SLS$DBX_NCP_Object_____________

              Step_Action________________________________________________

              1    From an account with BYPASS privilege, on the node
                   on which SLS software was just installed, invoke the
                   Network Control Program (NCP) utility by entering the
                   command:

                   $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:NCP

              ___________________________________________________________
              2    Obtain the password for the SLS account:

                   NCP> SHOW OBJECT SLS$DBX CHARACTERISTICS

                   Result:

                   Object Volatile Characteristics as of  04-Sep-2002 13:08:15

                   Object = SLS$DBX

                   Number                = 0
                   File id               = SYS$SYSTEM:SLS$FIND_DB_NODE.EXE

                   User id               = SLS
                   Password              = password

                   Note:

                   The password is displayed only when the BYPASS
                   privilege is enabled.

              4    Invoke the SYSMAN utility:

                   $RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSMAN

              ___________________________________________________________
              5    Set the SYSMAN environment to include the
                   OpenVMScluster system nodes that participate in the
                   DECnet OpenVMScluster system alias.

                   Participating_nodes:

                   The participating nodes in an OpenVMScluster can
                   be all of the nodes or only some of the nodes. To
                   identify the participating nodes, use one of the
                   following commands:

                   o  To identify all nodes . . .

                   SYSMAN> SET ENVIRONMENT /CLUSTER

                   o  To identify some specific nodes . . .

                   SYSMAN> SET ENVIRONMENT /NODE=(node_1,node_2,...node_n)

              ___________________________________________________________
              6    Define the SLS$DBX object with this command:

                   SYSMAN>DO MCR NCP DEFINE OBJECT SLS$DBX NUMBER 0 USER SLS -

                   _SYSMAN> FILE SYS$SYSTEM:SLS$FIND_DB_NODE.EXE PASSWORD password

                   Rule:

                   The password entered with this command must be the
                   same as the password used for the SLS account during
                   installation.

              ___________________________________________________________
              7    Read the SLS$DBX object on the node:

                   SYSMAN> DO MCR NCP SET KNOWN OBJECT ALL

        4.3.2 Defining the DECnet Phase V Network Object for SLS

              This section lists the commands that register the SLS$DBX
              object on nodes running DECnet, Phase V. You can use SYSMAN
              if all nodes in a OpenVMS Cluster to issue these commands
              at first. If only some of the nodes run DECnet, Phase V,
              you must issue these commands on those nodes individually.

        4.3.2.1 Issue the Commands on Currently Running Nodes

              Once you have installed SLS, you need to register the
              SLS$DBX object on the node. Issue the commands shown:

              RUN SYS$SYSTEM:NCL
              NCL> CREATE NODE 0 SESSION CONTROL APPLICATION  SLS$DBX
              NCL> SET NODE 0 SESSION CONTROL APPLICATION  SLS$DBX NODE SYNONYM TRUE
              NCL> SET NODE 0 SESSION CONTROL APPLICATION SLS$DBX ADDRESSES = {NAME = SLS$DBX}, -
              NCL> IMAGE NAME = "SYS$SYSTEM:SLS$FIND_DB_NODE.EXE", USER NAME = "SLS"

        4.3.2.2 Defining the SLS$DBX network object in the
                NET$APPLICATION_STARTUP.NCL File

              To define the SLS$DBX network object using DECnet-Plus
              (Phase V), first ensure that you are logged into the SYSTEM
              account. Then, execute the following command procedure to
              define the network object.

                  You have chosen the ADVANCED configuration option.  This
                  option enables you to do some specific tailoring of your
                  system's network configuration by answering some specific
                  questions.
                  If you do not want to do specific tailoring of your system's
                  network configuration but instead want to quickly configure your
                  system using most of the default answers, you should invoke
                  NET$CONFIGURE.COM with the BASIC configuration option, ie:

        4.4 Configuring SLS to Work With Specific VMS Versions

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Storage Library System for OpenVMS, Version 2.9G
                software is not supported on systems running OpenVMS,
                Version 7.0 operating system software.

                ______________________________________________________

              SLS, Version 2.9G operates on systems running OpenVMS VAX
              Versions 5.5-2, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3; and OpenVMS Alpha
              Versions 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.3-1. Three SLS files
              are dependent on the OpenVMS VAX version running on the
              system. When SLS is installed, the OpenVMS VAX version is
              checked, and the correct version of these files is set up
              for subsequent use. If you upgrade your OpenVMS VAX version

        After Installing SLS
        4.4 Configuring SLS to Work With Specific VMS Versions


              after you install SLS, you need to make sure you have the
              correct version-specific files to match the OpenVMS VAX
              version.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                There are no version-specific files for OpenVMS Alpha.
                If you are running SLS, Version 2.9G on an Alpha
                system, you can skip this section.

                ______________________________________________________

        4.4.1 Version-Specific Files

              When SLS, Version 2.9G is installed on your system, the
              installation procedure copies all files shown in Table 4-3
              into the indicated directories. The procedure then copies
              the three files appropriate for your OpenVMS version to the
              same name, except that the version number is removed from
              the file name.

              Example:

              If you are running VMS Version 5.5-2, then
              SLS$SYSTEM:BACKUPCMD-V55.CLD is copied to
              SLS$SYSTEM:BACKUPCMD.CLD. A similar copy is performed for
              the other two files.

        4.4.2 Upgrading OpenVMS Versions after Installing SLS

              If you install SLS, and then later upgrade your OpenVMS
              software version, you must copy the three SLS version
              dependent files to cause them to be used. A command
              procedure has been supplied for this purpose.

              Example:

              Assume you had installed SLS on a system running VMS
              Version 6.2. You later upgrade to OpenVMS Version 7.1. You
              must now execute the following command so that SLS will use
              the correct OpenVMS Version 7.1 version dependent files:

              $ @SLS$SYSTEM:SLS$VERSION_CHECK_AND_COPY.COM

              If you install a version of OpenVMS that is unknown to SLS,
              this command procedure displays an appropriate error of the
              following form:

              %SLS-E-NOVERMATCH, No version specific SLS files exist for OpenVMS Vn.n

              No files will be copied.

        After Installing SLS
        4.5 Upgrading from a Previous Version


        4.5 Upgrading from a Previous Version

              If you upgrade SLS software from a previous version, then:

              o  You need to review the applicability of customized
                 files.

              o  If you upgrade from SLS Version 2.0 software, you need
                 to retain previous applicable SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM
                 file symbol assignments.

              o  If you upgrade from SLS Version 2.1 software,
                 the installation procedure modifies your current
                 SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM file.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                SLS Version 2.9D software is incompatible with
                versions prior to SLS Version 2.5 software. This
                consideration applies to systems currently running
                SLS Version 2.4 software or earlier.

                When installed, SLS Version 2.5 through Version
                2.9D software converts the previous volume and
                magazine databases to a new format. All information is
                maintained in the databases, except that all magazines
                initially appear as "not imported" in a jukebox.

                ______________________________________________________

        4.5.1 Reviewing Outdated Files from SLS$CUSTOM

              Files placed in SLS$CUSTOM from a previous installation
              of SLS software may not be compatible with SLS, Version
              2.9G software. These files could include patched images or
              modified command procedures. You need to determine if these
              files should be removed from SLS$CUSTOM.

              Where_to_find_old_custom_files:

              If, during installation, files are found in SLS$CUSTOM,
              then the installation procedure:

              1. Creates a new directory, [SLS$FILES.OLDCUSTOM_n]

                 Each time an installation is performed, the value of
                 n increases. This indicates a new directory has been
                 created for the files in [SLS$FILES.CUSTOM] from the
                 previous installation.

              2. Renames and copies all the files in SLS$CUSTOM to the
                 new directory

              Recommendation:

              Review the files in [SLS$FILES.OLDCUSTOM_n] before placing
              them in [SLS$CUSTOM]. Files that predictably executed in a
              previous version of SLS software may be unpredictable with
              SLS, Version 2.9G software.

        4.5.2 Updating the Command File TAPESTART.COM

              Follow the steps in Table 4-4 update the new version of
              command file TAPESTART.COM. For information about media
              and device management symbols in TAPESTART.COM, see the
              Media and Device Management Services for OpenVMS Guide to
              Operations.

              Note:

              This procedure is required only if you upgraded from SLS
              Version 2.0 software.

                   Note:

                   The previous version of the file TAPESTART.COM is
                   named TAPESTART.OLD by the VMSINSTAL procedure. The
                   new installed version is properly named TAPESTART.COM.

        4.6 Configuring Media and Device Support

              Once SLS is installed, you need to configure it to use
              the appropriate media and device support before you can
              actually save and restore data. This includes determining
              what physical devices exist for your system and defining
              appropriate symbols in SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM to
              identify them to SLS. For more information on configuring
              media and device support, see the Media and Device
              Management Services for OpenVMS Guide to Operations.

        4.6.1 Configuring MDMS for an Automated Tape Library System

              If your storage management environment contains an ATL, you
              must define it in the MDMS file SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM.
              You must then test the configuration to make sure it is
              correct.

        4.6.1.1 Configure MDMS for an ATL

              The following procedure requires you to edit the MDMS file
              named SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM. You can use any ASCII text
              editor to accomplish these edits:

              1. Identify the primary processing node. Define the symbol
                 PRI to the name of the node or the OpenVMS Cluster alias
                 name executing the MDMS server.

                 If you defined the symbol PRI to the OpenVMS Cluster
                 alias, you must define the symbol DB_NODES to the names
                 of the nodes in the OpenVMS Cluster system that you want
                 to allow to be an MDMS servers.

              2. Identify the node on which the current TAPESTART.COM
                 file resides. Assign the node name to the NODE symbol.

              3. Define the QUICKLOAD symbol to 1 to facilitate
                 unattended backup.

              4. Create the autmatic tape library (ATL) definition. Use
                 the following example as a guideline:

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The robot device name and the tape drive names must be
                prefixed with a node name.

                ______________________________________________________

                 Example:_Defining_the_ATL

                 o  Assign the name meaningful name for the ATL (such as
                    ABS_JUKE) to the TAPE_JUKEBOXES symbol:

                    $ TAPE_JUKEBOXES := "ABS_JUKE"

                 o  Define the robot device name and the tape drives to
                    the jukebox name you assigned to the TAPE_JUKEBOXES
                    symbol:

                    $ ABS_JUKE := "NODE01::$1$DUA810:,NODE01::$1$MUA43:,NODE01::$1$MUA44:"

                    Where:

                    -  NODE01::$1$DUA810: is the node name plus the robot
                       device name

                    -  NODE01::$1$MUA43: and NODE01::$1$MUA44 are the
                       node names plus the names of the drives located in
                       the ATL

              5. Define the media triplets. Media triplets are a set of
                 symbols used to associate types of media with drives
                 capable of accessing them and define the media type,
                 density, and corresponding drive name. Use the following
                 example as a guideline:


                 Example:_Defining_the_Media_Triplets_for_an_ATL

                 $ MTYPE_1  :=  TK85K
                 $ DENS_1   :=
                 $ DRIVES_1 :=  $1$MUA43:,$1$MUA44:

                 Note:

                 During the installation of MDMS, MDMS provides an
                 autoconfiguration utility that creates default media
                 triplets. For each tape drive on the system from which
                 you run the autoconfiguration utility, the utility
                 creates a media triplet for that drive. Note that
                 these are suggested defaults, and you can change the
                 suggested default media triplets if you so choose.
                 Refer to  Archive/Backup System for OpenVMS Guide to
                 Operations for details about automatically generating
                 media triplets.

              6. Shut down and restart MDMS to enable all the changes
                 made to the TAPESTART.COM file. Use the following
                 command:

                 $ @SLS$SYSTEM:SLS$SHUTDOWN
                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:SLS$STARTUP

        4.6.1.2 Test the MDMS ATL Configuration

              This procedure guides you through testing the configuration
              for an ATL.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Before you perform the procedure, you must have an
                initialized volume that is compatible with the drive
                in the ATL. Use this initialized volume to perform
                this test.

              If you have MRU software, you can take this opportunity
              to learn more about the nature of the managed media
              environment. Compare the results of the STORAGE and ROBOT
              commands, or use MRU to verify the state of the automated
              media library after issuing a STORAGE command.

              Issue STORAGE and ROBOT commands at the DCL prompt.

              1. Check the response of the automated tape library to
                 MDMS. Issue the STORAGE SHOW JUKEBOX command:

                 VOLUME command:

                 $ STORAGE ADD VOLUME volume_id

              3. Verify the volume you just added with the STORAGE SHOW
                 VOLUME command:

                 $ STORAGE SHOW VOLUME volume_id

              4. Prepare to reply to MDMS requests with the OpenVMS OPCOM
                 REPLY command:

                 $ REPLY/ENABLE=TAPES

              5. Insert the volume for which you have just created a
                 volume database record into the library. Issue the
                 STORAGE IMPORT CARTRIDGE command:

                 $ STORAGE IMPORT CARTRIDGE volume_id tape_jukebox_name

                 Translate the location information from the STORAGE
                 IMPORT CARTRIDGE command into a slot location and issue
                 the ROBOT SHOW SLOT command to verify the volume is in
                 the slot:

        $ ROBOT SHOW [ROBOT robot_name] SLOT [[[slot_number]|[slot_number-slot_number]],...]

              6. Load the volume into the drive with the STORAGE LOAD

                 has been returned to the slot from which it was loaded:

        $ ROBOT SHOW [ROBOT robot_name] SLOT [[[slot_number]|[slot_number-slot_number]],...]

              8. Remove the volume from the library with the STORAGE
                 EXPORT CARTRIDGE command:

                 $ STORAGE EXPORT CARTRIDGE volume-name

        4.6.2 Configuring MDMS for a Media Loader

              If your storage management environment contains a media
              loader, you must define the media loader in the MDMS
              file SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM. You must then test the
              configuration to make sure it is correct.

        4.6.2.1 Configure MDMS for a Media Loader

              The following procedure requires you to edit the MDMS file
              named SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM. You can use any ASCII text
              editor to accomplish these edits:

              1. Identify the primary processing node. Define the symbol
                 PRI to the name of the node or the OpenVMS Cluster alias
                 name executing the MDMS server.

                 If you defined the symbol PRI to the OpenVMS Cluster
                 alias, you must define the symbol DB_NODES to the names
                 of the nodes in the OpenVMS Cluster system that you want
                 to act as MDMS servers.

              2. Identify the node on which the current TAPESTART.COM
                 file resides. Assign the node name to the NODE symbol.

              3. Define the QUICKLOAD symbol to 1 to facilitate
                 unattended backup.

              4. Create the media loader definition. Use the following
                 example as a guideline:

                 Example:_Defining_a_Media_Loader

                 Define a symbol ABS_JUKE to the names of the robot
                 device and tape drive of the automated media library
                 system. The following example shows how define the TAPE_
                 JUKEBOXES symbol:

                 Assign a meaningful name (such as ABS_JUKE) to the TAPE_
                 JUKEBOXES symbol:

                 $ TAPE_JUKEBOXES := "ABS_JUKE"

                 Define the robot device name and the tape drive to the
                 jukebox name defined by the TAPE_JUKEBOXES symbol:

                 $ ABS_JUKE := "NODE01::$1$DUA810:,NODE01::$1$MUA43:

                 Where:

                 o  NODE01::$1$DUA810: is the robot changer name

                 o  NODE01::$1$MUA43: is the node name plus the drive
                    name of the media loader

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The robot device name and the tape drive names must be
                prefixed with a node name.

                ______________________________________________________

              5. Define the media triplets. Media triplets are a set of
                 symbols used to associate types of media with drives
                 capable of accessing them. Use the following example as
                 a guideline:

              This procedure guides you through testing the MDMS
              configuration.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Before you perform the procedure, you must have an
                initialized volume that is compatible with the drive
                in the media loader. Use this initialized volume to
                perform this test.

                ______________________________________________________

              If you have MRU software, you can take this opportunity

        4.6.3 Configuring for an Operator Attended Drive

              If your storage management environment has an operator
              attended drive or drives, you must define the drive(s) in
              the MDMS file SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM. You must then test
              the configuration to make sure it is correct.

        4.6.3.1 Configure MDMS for an Operator Attended Device

              The following procedure requires you to edit the
              SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM file. You can use any ASCII text
              editor to accomplish these edits.

              1. Identify the primary processing node. Define the symbol
                 PRI to the name of the node or the OpenVMS Cluster alias
                 name executing the MDMS server.

                 If you defined the symbol PRI to the OpenVMS Cluster
                 alias, you must define the symbol DB_NODES to the nodes
                 names in the OpenVMS Cluster system that will be allowed
                 to be the MDMS server should the active MDMS server
                 fail.

              2. Identify the node on which the current TAPESTART.COM
                 file resides. Define the NODE symbol to that name.

              3. Define the media triplets. Use the following example as
                 a guideline:

                 Example:_Defining_a_Media_Triplet_for_an_Operator_Attended_Drive

              4. Decide whether operator intervention and acknowledgment
                 is needed then define the QUICKLOAD accordinnly. If you
                 need operator intervention, assign QUICKLOAD to 0. If
                 you do not want operator intervention, assign QUICKLOAD
                 to 1.

              5. Configure the Volume Pools. Use the MDMS Administrators
                 Menu. From OpenVMS, issue the SLSMGR command.

        4.6.4 Configuring Remote Tape or Optical Drives

              If you answered "Yes" to either of the remote support
              prompts during the MDMS installation procedure, then MDMS
              automatically installed the RDF software.

              Table 4-5 describes how to configure the files
              SLS$ROOT:[TTI_RDEV]CONFIG_nodename.DAT and
              SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM to enable remote drive
              selection.

                                 4.6 Configuring Media and Device Support


              1. Determine which tape or optical drive(s) will receive
                 the backup data.

              2. Check the file SLS$ROOT:[TTI_RDEV]CONFIG_nodename.DAT to
                 make sure the drives are defined in this file.

                 The installation procedure creates a drive configuration
                 file named SLS$ROOT:[TTI_RDEV]CONFIG_nodename.DAT. In
                 this file, include the drive names you wish to use for
                 remote backup operations.

                 Example_of_SLS$ROOT:[TTI_RDEV]CONFIG_nodename.DAT:

                 ! The format of this configuration file is:
                 !
                 !  DEVICE  servable_device  [characteristic1,...]
                 !---------------------------------------------------------------
                 device $1$MUA200:  MUA200
                 device $1$MUA210:  MUA210
                 device $1$MUA220:  MUA220

              3. Edit the file SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM and define
                 media triplets that define the media type, density,
                 and corresponding drive name. Make sure the drive names
                 appear as local drives (do not prefix the drive name
                 with a node name). The drive name must consist of either
                 a physical name or the characteristic name of the drive
                 or drives available for remote backup operations.

                 Example_of_SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM:

                 ! Media triplet definitions
                 $ MTYPE_8  :=  TK86K

                 Media type names cannot exceed 16 characters.

        4.6.4.2 On The System Where the Data Resides

              On the system that contains the disks with the data you
              want to back up, add one or more media triplets that define
              the remote drive names in the SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM
              file. To the dirve definition, include the node name where
              the drive is physically connected. Do not assign the node
              name to drives that are local to this system.

              Example_of_SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM:

              ! Media triplet definitions
              $ MTYPE_8  :=  TK86K
              $ DENS_8   :=
              $ DRIVES_8 :=  NODE01::$1$MUA200:
              $!
              $ MTYPE_9  :=  NODE01TK85K
              $ DENS_9   :=  NOCOMP
              $ DRIVES_9 :=  NODE01::$1$MUA210:
              $!
              $ MTYPE_10 :=  NODE01TK85K_COMP
              $ DENS_10  :=  COMP
              $ DRIVES_10 := NODE01::$1$MUA220:

              See  Archive/Backup System for OpenVMS Guide to Operations
              for additional information about creating media triplets
              and defining remote drives.

        4.7 Configuring Remote Device Facility Support

              If you requested support for the Remote Device Facility
              (RDF) during installation, then you need to identify server
              and client controls.

        4.7.1 Adding RDF Client Support

              In the SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM file, add one or more
              media triplets that describe the remote tape device names.

              Important:

              It is important to add the remote node name to each device
              name.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------

        The following post-installation steps are necessary.
        Refer to the Installation Guide for details.

        1. Edit the system startup procedure to start the SLS software
           on this client.  Add
        $ @SYS$STARTUP:SLS$STARTUP

        2. Edit the system wide login file.  Add
        $ @SYS$MANAGER:SLS$TAPSYMBOL

        3. Run SLS$SYSTEM:SLS$SLSMGR.EXE to perform the following functions:
        a. Authorize access to the SLS server database for
           SLS client nodes.
        b. Authorize access to SLS pools for SLS users.

        4. Customize SYS$MANAGER:TAPESTART.COM to reflect SLS environment
           parameters.

        5. Check that SLS$DBX object is defined on all nodes participating
           in the VMScluster System alias.

        6. For Remote Device Facility client support, you should add one
           or more media-type triplets (MTYPE_x, DENS_x, DRIVES_x) to
           your TAPESTART.COM to describe the remote tape drives.  Be
           sure to include the remote nodename in each drive name.

        7. For Remote Device Facility server support, you should check
           the file SLS$ROOT:[TTI_RDEV]CONFIG_NODE1.DAT to ensure
           that the tape devices you wish to serve are included in
           this RDF configuration file.  This file will be created
           initially when SLS is started after this installation.

        8. On both Alpha and VAX systems, if you are upgrading from version 2.9B
           or earlier, you MUST reboot your system before using the
           Remote Device Facility.
