PRODUCT NAME:  BASEstar Classic DAS for Allen-Bradley Data Highway Pro-
tocol, Version 3.4A                                    SPD 64.67.01

DESCRIPTION

The BASEstar Classic DAS for Allen-Bradley Data Highway Protocol al-
lows users to access Allen-Bradley Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
through the BASEstar Classic Device Connect Manager (DCM).

Via BASEstar Classic DCM, the user may configure path, type, device,
and physical point definitions, and also configure for polled and un-
solicited data collection.

Using the BASEstar Classic DAS for Allen-Bradley Data Highway Proto-
col, users or applications can perform a variety of device access func-
tions for the Allen-Bradley family of PLCs. Examples of functions sup-
ported for the Allen-Bradley PLCs include: reading and writing data,
uploading and downloading logic programs, and reading the status of
a device. The BASEstar Classic DAS for Allen-Bradley Data Highway Pro-
tocol also supports structured data, which allows structures to be im-
posed on plant-floor data.

The BASEstar Classic DAS for Allen-Bradley Data Highway Protocol sup-
ports the following Allen-Bradley PLCs:

o  Allen-Bradley PLC-1774

o  Allen-Bradley PLC-2, PLC-2/02, PLC-2/05, PLC-2/15, PLC-2/16, PLC-
   2/17, PLC-2/20, PLC-2/30

o  Allen-Bradley PLC-3 Family of devices
