PRODUCT NAME:  DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.3                   SPD
34.26.07

DESCRIPTION

DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.3 supports both the OpenVMS for Alpha and
OpenVMS for VAX platforms.

DECram for OpenVMS is a disk device driver that improves I/O perfor-
mance by allowing an OpenVMS system manager to create pseudo disks
(RAMdisks),
which reside in main memory. Frequently accessed data can be accessed
much faster from a DECram device than from a physical disk device. These
RAMdisks can be accessed through the file system just as physical disks
are accessed, requiring no change to the application or the system soft-
ware.

Because main memory is allocated for a DECram device, extra memory is
generally required. The OpenVMS system manager can designate the amount
of memory dedicated to the DECram device(s) and the files that will
be stored on it.

Cluster Environment

                                                      January, 1999


 

DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.3 is fully supported when installed on
any valid and licensed standalone Alpha or VAX system, or any clus-
tered VAX system. DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.3 is required for any
OpenVMS Cluster systems running any version of OpenVMS Alpha.

DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.3 supports operation in an Adaptive Par-
titioned Multi-Processing (APMP) environment, also known as Compaq Galaxy
Software Architecture on OpenVMS. Previous versions of DECram must not
be used if RAM disks are being served, or served and shadowed, across
nodes within a cluster, or if DECram is being used in an Adaptive Par-
titioned Multi-Processing instance.

Multiple DECram devices can be members of a Volume Shadowing for Open-
VMS shadow set and can be served by mass storage control protocol (MSCP).
There are no special hardware requirements to install DECram for Open-
VMS Version 2.3.

User Interface

The user interface to a DECram device is the same as other disk class
devices. Note that the response to a SHOW DEVICE /FULL command will
indicate "device type unknown" in current OpenVMS releases. The de-
vice type DT$_RAM_DISK is not known by the SHOW DEVICE command in cur-
rent OpenVMS releases.

Management Interface

A DECram device is managed by the same tools used to manage any other
OpenVMS disk device. For example, the INITIALIZE, MOUNT, and DIREC-
TORY commands will work the same on both hard disk and DECram devices.
However, the standard utilities are used differently to set up a DE-
Cram device.

System Analysis

Before creating a DECram device, the OpenVMS system manager must de-
termine its size. Each disk block allocated to a DECram device will
mean one less page of available memory. The system manager should also
assess the need for multiple DECram units. See Restrictions listed be-
low.

System Generation

When adding a DECram device, the OpenVMS system manager must reassess
the values for the SYSGEN parameters that control paging and swapping
behavior.

Restrictions

DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.3 currently has the following restric-
tions:

o  Data in a DECram device is volatile.

o  Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS will support shadow sets composed of
   DECram devices and other disk class devices, in a future release.
   Removal of the last non DECram device will cause the shadow set vir-
   tual unit to abort and become unavailable. Please refer to the Vol-
   ume Shadowing for OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 27.29.xx)
   for more information.

o  A single DECram device size on OpenVMS Alpha systems running Ver-
   sion 7.1 or higher is limited to 32GB.

o  A single DECram device size on OpenVMS VAX systems running Version
   6.2 or higher is limited to 524,280 blocks.

Note: For disk volumes larger than 524,280 blocks on VAX or 32GB on Al-
pha, multiple DECram disk devices can be created and bound into a vol-
ume set.

DECram for OpenVMS is not designed to support long-term data storage.
If a system or hardware failure occurs, data stored in the DECram de-
vice is lost and must be re-created. This restriction does not apply
if the device is shadowed to a real physical device, using a supported
version of OpenVMS Volume Shadowing.
