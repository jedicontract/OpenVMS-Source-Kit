          Dear DECram Customer:

          Compaq Computer Corporation is pleased to provide the DECram for
          OpenVMS[TM] Version 2.3 product to our customers.

          DECram for OpenVMS is a disk device that allows a system manager
          to create psuedo disks (RAMdisks) that reside in the main memory
          of OpenVMS systems to improve I/O performance.

          DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.3 can be installed as an update
          to a prior release of DECram, if one is currently installed on
          your system, or directly on your system if no prior version is
          currently installed.

          DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.3 is fully supported when installed
          on any valid and licensed standalone Alpha or VAX system, or any
          clustered VAX system. DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.3 is required
          for any OpenVMS Cluster systems running any version of OpenVMS
          Alpha.

          Multiple DECram devices can be members of a Volume Shadowing
          for OpenVMS shadow set and can be served by mass storage control
          protocol (MSCP). There are no special hardware requirements to
          install DECram for OpenVMS.

          With DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.3, the limit on the DECram
          device size has been extended to 32GB on OpenVMS Alpha systems
          running Version 7.1 or higher. A single device size on OpenVMS
          VAX systems running Version 6.2 or higher is limited to 524,280
          blocks.

          DECram Version 2.3 supports operation in an Adaptive Partitioned
          Multi-Processing (APMP) environment, also known as Compaq Galaxy
          Software Architecture on OpenVMS.
