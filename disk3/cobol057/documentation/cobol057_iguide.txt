                                                                  Preface



              This guide describes how to install Compaq COBOL on the
              OpenVMS VAX operating system, or VAX/VMS, in the case
              of Version 5.5-2. It is intended for system managers.
              This document applies to Compaq COBOL Version 5.7 and any
              maintenance updates for that version.

              For more information about installing Compaq COBOL on
              OpenVMS VAX or VAX/VMS systems, refer to your processor-
              specific installation or operations guide.

              The installation procedure is described step-by-step and
              is, for the most part, self-explanatory. The system prompts
              you to answer questions and to change volumes, and waits
              for you to tell it to continue.

                                        Preparing to Install Compaq COBOL


              Your bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report
              (BIL) specify the number and contents of your media.
              Be sure to check the contents of your kit against this
              information. If your kit is damaged or if you find that
              parts of it are missing, call your Compaq representative.

              Your distribution kit includes a letter titled Read Before
              Installing or Using Compaq COBOL Version 5.7 for OpenVMS
              VAX Systems. The letter discusses important information
              that might not be included in this guide. You should read
              this letter before beginning the installation.

              Distribution media must be mounted in numerical order. The
              installation procedure prompts you to mount the volumes.
              For more information on how to mount distribution media,
              refer to your processor-specific installation or operations
              guide.

              This guide also details several options to the installation
              procedure.

        1.1 Accessing the Online Release Notes

              Compaq COBOL provides online release notes. The prompt
              to display or print the release notes before installation
              appears in Step 4 of the installation procedure when you
              invoke VMSINSTAL with the OPTIONS N parameter. Please read
              the release notes before you install COBOL, as they may
              contain important information about changes.

              After the installation, the release notes are available in
              text format and PostScript format in the following files:

                 SYS$HELP:COBOL05n.RELEASE_NOTES (text file)
                 SYS$HELP:COBOL05n_RELEASE_NOTES.PS

              Where n represents version point release number.

              Online help also directs you to the release notes file.
              After the installation, type the following:

              $ HELP COBOL RELEASE_NOTES   <Return>

        1.2 System Prerequisites

              This is a complete kit for Compaq COBOL. You do not need to
              have installed any earlier versions of Compaq COBOL before
              installing Version 5.n. (Note that for n you should use the
              actual maintenance-update number after the decimal point,
              for example, 7 in Version 5.7, which appears on the title
              page as the Software Version.)

              Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX Version 5.7 requires VAX/VMS
              Version 5.5-2 or OpenVMS VAX Version 6.1 or higher. Certain
              Compaq COBOL features may require higher versions of
              OpenVMS VAX. See the SPD for information about specific
              system dependencies.

              If you are installing Oracle Rdb or Oracle CDD/Repository,
              you should make certain that they have been successfully
              installed before you attempt to install Compaq COBOL.
              To eliminate possible installation errors, execute
              the following command procedure to start up Oracle
              CDD/Repository:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:CDDSTRTUP.COM   <Return>

        1.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The installation should take approximately 5 to 10
              minutes, depending on the type of media and your system
              configuration. Before installing Compaq COBOL, you must
              have the following privileges and resources:

              o  SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV
                 privileges.

              o  A minimum of 12,000 blocks of free disk space during
                 installation. After the installation, approximately
                 4,000 blocks are used.

              o  A minimum of 950 free global pages plus the
                 size (in number of disk blocks) of the file
                 SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE at installation. After the
                 installation, 950 free global pages plus the size of
                 SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE are used.

              o  A minimum of 3 free global sections are needed at
                 installation; 3 global sections are used after
                 installation.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                You must ensure that your system has the necessary
                global page and global section SYSGEN quotas for the
                installation. Failure to do so could cause the DCL
                tables to be corrupted in some situations.

                ______________________________________________________

              To determine the number of available global pages on your
              system, invoke the OpenVMS Install utility (INSTALL) by
              typing the following command:

              $ INSTALL   <Return>

              Then type the following command:

              INSTALL> LIST/GLOBAL/SUMMARY   <Return>

                      Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

                   nn Global Sections Used,  nnn/nnnn Global Pages Used/Unused

              INSTALL> EXIT   <Return>

              When you issue these commands, the system displays a
              summary of the number of global sections used, the number
              of global pages used, and the number of global pages
              unused. To exit from the OpenVMS Install utility, type
              the EXIT command.

              Compaq COBOL requires approximately 950 free global pages.
              If fewer than 950 pages are available, you can delete an
              existing known image using the OpenVMS Install utility,
              or you can increase the GBLPAGES system parameter with the
              OpenVMS System Generation utility (SYSGEN), as described
              below..

                                    Preparing to Install Compaq COBOL 1-3

 







              You can determine the number of available global sections
              by invoking SYSGEN as follows:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN   <Return>
              SYSGEN>USE CURRENT   <Return>
              SYSGEN>SHOW GBLSECTIONS   <Return>

              SYSGEN>EXIT   <Return>

              The last number displayed is the maximum number of global
              sections. Compare this to the number of global sections in
              use displayed by the OpenVMS Install utility. Compaq COBOL
              requires 3 global sections. Therefore, if the number of
              global sections used plus 3 exceeds the current number of
              global sections, you must increase the number of available
              global sections before you can install Compaq COBOL.

              To increase the number, you must increase the GBLSECTIONS
              system parameter with SYSGEN by editing the file
              SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and then invoking the
              SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM procedure. For more information on
              the AUTOGEN.COM procedure, refer to your processor-specific
              installation or operations guide.

              If the number of global sections used plus 3 is less than
              the maximum number of global sections, you can exit from
              SYSGEN and continue.

        1.4 Special Requirements

              A license Product Authorization Key (PAK) must be
              registered with the License Management Facility in order
              to use Compaq COBOL:

              o  If this is a new installation, please be sure to
                 register the Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX Systems PAK
                 before starting the installation procedure.

              o  If this is an update to an existing installation, the
                 PAK should already be registered in the license database
                 and no further action needs to be taken.

              You can register the information contained in the PAK that
              is shipped to new customers with Compaq COBOL by using
              either the OpenVMS License command procedure (VMSLICENSE)
              or the LICENSE REGISTER command, as described in the
              OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you are missing your PAK and you have purchased a
                software support contract, you can obtain a Temporary
                Service PAK. For more information, call your Customer
                Support Center.

                ______________________________________________________

              Hardware Requirements

              Object modules produced by the Compaq COBOL compiler can be
              executed incorrectly if your OpenVMS VAX operating system
              does not meet the following requirements when you install
              the compiler:

              o  A VAX-11/780 computer must have the hardware engineering
                 change order (ECO) status of system level 4 or higher.

              o  A VAX-11/730 must have the writable control store (WCS)
                 status of system level 50 or higher.

              The Compaq COBOL Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
              checks for the presence or absence of these two ECO and WCS
              status requirements.

              If you plan to use the Oracle Database Management System
              (Oracle DBMS), Oracle CDD/Repository, or both, refer to the
              installation guides for these products for information on
              their ECO requirements.

        1.5 Backing Up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if you
              have backed up your system disk. Compaq recommends that you
              do a system disk backup before installing any software.

              Use the backup procedures that are established at your
              site. For details on performing a system disk backup, see
              the section on backing up the system disk in the OpenVMS
              System Manager's Manual.

              This chapter describes:

              o  Use of the VMSINSTAL command procedure

              o  Installation of Compaq COBOL step by step

              o  Installation on a VAXcluster

              o  Installation as a shared image

              o  Product registration in the POLYCENTER Software
                 Installation utility (PCSI) database

        2.1 Using VMSINSTAL

              After you log in to a privileged account to install
              Compaq COBOL, set the default to SYS$UPDATE: and then
              invoke VMSINSTAL, the command procedure that installs this
              product, as follows:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE   <Return>
              $ @VMSINSTAL COBOLver ddn: option-list   <Return>

              The following paragraphs describe the command parameters.

              ver
              Represents the version and maintenance update number of
              Compaq COBOL (for example, 057). Refer to the label on the
              Compaq COBOL distribution kit or the Compaq COBOL BOM or
              BIL for the number.

              ddn:
              Represents a device name where the distribution volumes
              will be mounted for the Compaq COBOL installation media;
              dd is the device code and n is the unit number. It is not
              necessary to use the console drive to install Compaq COBOL.
              If you do use the console drive, you should replace any

                                      about the release notes. You should
                                      review the release notes before
                                      proceeding with the installation

                                      reviewed the release notes,
                                      you may omit the N option. (The
                                      Compaq COBOL Release Notes will
                                      be available regardless because
                                      VMSINSTAL copies them to the
                                      SYS$HELP directory.)

              ________________________running_system.____________________

              You can also type an asterisk (*) in place of COBOL and its
              version number if you are installing from magnetic tape to
              save installation time. The asterisk causes Compaq COBOL to
              be installed with a minimum of tape passes.

              For example, the first parameter to VMSINSTAL for Compaq
              COBOL Version 5.7 could be either COBOL057 or *.

              When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

              o  Whether or not you are logged in to a privileged
                 account. Compaq recommends that you install software
                 from the system manager's account with your default
                 device and directory set to SYS$UPDATE.

              o  Whether or not you have adequate quotas for
                 installation.

              VMSINSTAL then checks whether or not the following
              conditions exist:

              o  DECnet is up and running.

              o  Any users are logged in to the system.

              If VMSINSTAL detects either of these conditions, you
              will be asked whether or not you want to continue the
              installation. If you want to continue, type YES. If you
              want to stop the installation, press Return.

              Note that if another user accesses the Help file during
              your installation, it will be locked and cannot be updated.
              In this case you will have to update Help manually after
              the installation. Informational messages will be displayed
              (see Step 9).

        2.2 Step-by-Step Installation

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step.

              Defaults appear in brackets throughout the installation
              procedure. To take a default, you can simply press Return.
              You can type Y or N for YES or NO.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              then returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
              installation procedure after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must
              proceed from Step 2.

              Step 1: Log in to a privileged account and set your default
              device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

                                <Return>
              Username: SYSTEM    <Return>
              Password:         <Return>
              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE   <Return>

              Step 2: Invoke VMSINSTAL.

              $ @VMSINSTAL COBOLver MYCPU$MUA100: OPTIONS N   <Return>

                    OpenVMS VAX Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.n

              * Are you satisfied with the backup of your
                 system disk [YES]? <Return>

              If you are satisfied with the backup of your system disk,
              press Return. Otherwise, type NO and press Return to
              discontinue the installation.

              Step 3: Insert the first installation kit volume.

              Depending on your media, you may get the following prompts:

              Please mount the first volume of the set on MYCPU$MUA100:.
              * Are you ready? YES   <Return>

              To indicate that you want to continue the installation:

              1. Mount the installation volume.

              2. Type YES.

              3. Press Return.

              The following products will be processed:

                  Release notes included with this kit are always copied to
                  SYS$HELP.

              Step 4: Select a release notes option.

              This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in Step
              2.

              Additional Release Notes Options:

                   1.  Display release notes
                   2.  Print release notes
                   3.  Both 1 and 2
                   4.  None of the above

              * Select option [2]:   <Return>

              If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. They are lengthy. You can
              terminate the display at any time by pressing Ctrl/C.

              If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue
              name. Either type a queue name or press Return to send the
              file to the default output print device.

              * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:   <Return>

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately and then prompts you for a queue
              name.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                This version of the release notes file installed by
                VMSINSTAL is labeled with the current product name
                and version number. Take care not to delete release
                notes for previous versions. They still may contain
                information that is useful to you.

                ______________________________________________________

              Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

              * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]? Y   <Return>
              %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been
               moved to SYS$HELP.

              If you want to continue the installation, type YES and
              press Return. Otherwise, VMSINSTAL discontinues the
              installation. In either case, VMSINSTAL moves the release
              notes to SYS$HELP.

              Step 5: Install the COBOL Run-Time Library image separately
              (if applicable).

              Compaq COBOL allows you to install the COBOL Run-Time
              Library (COBRTL) image (COBRTL.EXE) separately from the
              full product installation. This option can be useful if
              your COBRTL has been overwritten or lost, or if you need to
              run a COBOL application compiled with Compaq COBOL V5.n on
              a system that does not have Compaq COBOL V5.n installed.

              Type NO or press Return at the prompt to continue with the
              full installation of Compaq COBOL.

              If you want to install the COBRTL image only, type YES and
              press Return in response to the prompt, as follows:

              * Do you want to install only the COBRTL [NO]? Y   <Return>

              In this case, the installation skips any subsequent
              inquiries, including the question about the PAK, and
              proceeds to install only the COBRTL image.

              As in the full installation, the version of the current
              COBRTL.EXE is automatically checked.

              If the version already installed on your system is
              later than the COBRTL.EXE you are attempting to install
              separately, the installation procedure issues the following
              message followed by another prompt:

              %COBOL-I-IDNTCK, COBRTL found in SYS$SHARE has later ident than
               COBRTL to be installed.
              Do you still want to install COBRTL from kit [NO]?   <Return>

              Press Return at the prompt to terminate the installation
              without installing the COBRTL image supplied with your
              Compaq COBOL kit. Or type YES and press Return to install
              it.

              * Do you still want to install COBRTL from kit [NO]? Y   <Return>
              %COBOL-I-UPDIMG, Installing new COBRTL image
              %PATCH-I-NOLCL, image does not contain local symbols
              %PATCH-I-WRTFIL, updating image file ...
               DKB300:[SYS0.SYSUPD.COBOLver]COBRTL.EXE;2
              %COBOL-I-UPDOBJ, Updating system object library
              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target
               directories...

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If your system includes a later version of the
                COBRTL.EXE than the one that is supplied with your
                Compaq COBOL kit, it is highly recommended that
                you not install the earlier kit version. Backward
                compatibility for your applications is not guaranteed;
                that is, while applications compiled with older
                versions of COBOL will run compatibly with newer
                versions of the COBRTL, the reverse may not be true.

                ______________________________________________________

              Remember to use the INSTALL utility to make the COBRTL.EXE
              that is replaced by the installation a known image. This
              must be done on every node in a VAXcluster. Use INSTALL
              REPLACE or use the OpenVMS System Management utility
              (SYSMAN) to facilitate the installation on multiple nodes
              (see Section 2.3).

              Step 6: Respond to LMF queries.

              This product supports the OpenVMS License Management
              Facility (LMF). For more information on LMF, see the
              OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

              During the installation procedure, the Compaq COBOL Product
              Authorization Key (PAK) is invoked and the following
              questions are asked:

              * Does this product have an authorization key registered and
                 loaded? YES   <Return>

              This step allows you to indicate whether or not your LMF
              license for Compaq COBOL is registered and loaded.

              It is strongly recommended that you install the PAK for
              Compaq COBOL prior to installing the product.

              If the PAK is not installed, you can still proceed with
              the installation and install the PAK after the installation
              is complete. However, a check for the PAK is done by the
              compiler during the IVP, and if the PAK is not installed,
              the IVP will fail. Also, the build of the REFORMAT utility
              (Step 7) requires prior installation of the PAK.

              The following list summarizes the outcome of your responses
              to this query:

              o  If you answer YES and the PAK is installed, the
                 installation proceeds normally.

              o  If you answer YES and the PAK is not installed, the IVP
                 will fail.

              o  If you answer YES and the PAK is not installed, the
                 installation fails if you selected the REFORMAT utility
                 option.

              o  If you answer NO, the installation terminates.

              In any case, the Compaq COBOL compiler will not execute
              until the PAK for Compaq COBOL is installed.

              Step 7: Install the REFORMAT utility.

              * Do you want the REFORMAT utility installed [YES]?   <Return>

              Depending on your use of Compaq COBOL, you may want to
              install the optional REFORMAT utility.

              Step 8: Respond to the message file query.

              * Do you want to save the COBOL message file for
                 modification [NO]?   <Return>

              This query enables you to edit the Compaq COBOL message
              file
              COBOLMSG.MSG. Customized messages are often desirable
              for international users. If you plan to edit the message
              file, type YES and press Return. If you do not want to edit
              the message file, press Return. For more information, see
              Section 3.2.

              Step 9: Respond to the purge files query.

              If the
              installation is successful, the SYS$EXAMPLES, SYS$HELP,
              SYS$LIBRARY, SYS$MANAGER, SYS$UPDATE, SYS$MESSAGE, and
              SYS$SYSTEM directories may contain previous versions of the
              following Compaq COBOL files:

              o  [SYSEXE]COBOL.EXE

              o  [SYSEXE]REFORMAT.EXE

              o  [SYSLIB]DCLTABLES.EXE

              o  [SYSTEST.COBOL]COBOL$IVP.COM

              o  [SYSHLP]COBOLver.RELEASE_NOTES

              o  [SYSHLP]COBOLver_RELEASE_NOTES.PS

              o  [SYSMSG]COBOLMSG.EXE

              o  [SYSUPD]COBOLMSG.MSG

              o  [SYSLIB]LSE$SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT.ENV

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation
              [YES]?   <Return>

              These files are replaced during the installation with new
              files, but the old files are not automatically purged.
              Purging is recommended. (Purging will not destroy earlier
              versions of the release notes, which you should retain.) In
              response to the purging prompt, press Return to purge the
              files or type NO to keep them. In either case, the system
              help files are updated.

              Not purging these files allows you to go back to a previous
              version of a file, if necessary.

              The installation may also create a new version of the
              following file, which is not purged along with the other
              files:

              o  [SYSLIB]COBRTL.EXE

              The installation procedure may update the following files
              (it will not create new versions of them, nor will it purge
              them):

              o  [SYSLIB]IMAGELIB.OLB

              o  [SYSLIB]STARLET.OLB

              The query on purging files is the last one you have to
              respond to during the installation. After you respond to
              this query, the following message is displayed:

                No more questions will be asked during this installation.

              If another user has locked the Help file during the
              installation, the following three informational messages
              are issued:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-DCLHLPINUSE, DCL HELP could not be updated.
              -VMSINSTAL-I-DCLHLPINUSE, manually update HELP libraries after
              installation.
              -VMSINSTAL-I-DCLHLPINUSE, use SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP]COBOLHLP.HLP for
              providing new HELP.

              You may need to mount additional distribution volumes
              depending on the media used. In this case, you will receive
              a prompt from VMSINSTAL to determine that you are ready to
              proceed. (See Step 10.)

              Step 10: Insert the subsequent installation kit volumes as
              requested.

              %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2
              on _MYCPU$MUA100: for reading

              Enter "YES" when ready: YES   <Return>

              VMSINSTAL prompts you to insert the next volume and waits
              for you to type YES after inserting it. If you type
              NO, VMSINSTAL displays the prompt again. This prompt is
              displayed only if your installation kit contains more than
              one volume. Exactly when these prompts appear depends on
              the type of media that you are using.

        2-10 Installing Compaq COBOL

 







              Step 11: Read the informational messages.

              The Compaq COBOL installation procedure produces a number
              of informational messages that report on the progress of
              the installation.

              The success of the installation is indicated by the
              following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their
              target directories...

              If the installation procedure is successful, the new or
              modified files are moved to their target directories.

              The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
              files are updated to include the new versions of the
              Compaq COBOL Help text and the Compaq COBOL command line
              definition.

              Step 12: Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

              VMSINSTAL now calls the IVP to verify that Compaq COBOL was
              installed successfully.

              Start of Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX Installation
              Verification Procedure

              Successful test of Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX V5.n-cc
              Installation of COBOL V5.n completed at hh:mm

              If another user has locked the Help file during your
              installation, the following messages are displayed:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-REFDCLHLP, DCL HELP could not be updated.
              -VMSINSTAL-I-REFDCLHLP, Reference SYS$UPDATE:DODCLHELP.VMI
              for information on -VMSINSTAL-I-REFDCLHLP, updating DCL HELP.

              Step 13: End the installation procedure.

                 VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

              $ LOGOUT   <Return>
              SYSTEM     logged out at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ss

              When the product installation procedure is complete, you
              can choose to install more products or to log out (as shown
              here). If you removed any media from the console drive
              before beginning the installation, you should replace it
              now.

              Note that VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the
              process symbol tables during the installation. Therefore,
              if you are going to continue using the system manager's
              account and you want to restore these symbols, you should
              log out and log in again.

        2.3 Installing Compaq COBOL on a VAXcluster

              You can use the OpenVMS System Management utility (SYSMAN)
              to facilitate running Compaq COBOL on multiple nodes in a
              cluster. With SYSMAN, you can define a system management
              environment so that operations performed on one node
              are automatically executed on all other nodes in the
              VAXcluster. (See the OpenVMS VAX documentation for more
              information.)

              Always check first to see that you have the appropriate
              software license. Once you have installed Compaq COBOL
              on one system disk in the VAXcluster, you can update
              the version of the DCL tables and the version of the
              COBRTL installed on the other nodes in the cluster. Do
              the following:

              1. Log in to a privileged account on a node on the
                 VAXcluster. Invoke SYSMAN and enter the following
                 command at the SYSMAN> prompt:

                 SYSMAN>SET ENVIRONMENT/CLUSTER   <Return>

              2. If you are a new customer, ensure that the PAK has been
                 registered before attempting to install Compaq COBOL.
                 To load the PAK on all nodes in your cluster environment
                 simultaneously, invoke SYSMAN and enter the following
                 command at the SYSMAN> prompt:

                 SYSMAN>LICENSE LOAD COBOL   <Return>

              3. Enter the following commands at the SYSMAN> prompt:

                 SYSMAN>DO INSTALL REPLACE SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES.EXE   <Return>
                 SYSMAN>DO INSTALL REPLACE SYS$SHARE:COBRTL.EXE   <Return>

        2.4 Installing Compaq COBOL as a Shared Image

              If Compaq COBOL will be used extensively on your system,
              you can reduce the system overhead and memory requirements
              by installing it as a shared image. To perform the
              installation on a system that is currently running, use
              the OpenVMS Install utility while you are logged in to a
              privileged account. If errors occur, consult the OpenVMS
              system messages documentation.

              Do the following to install Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX as
              a shared image:

              1. Determine the number of available global pages and
                 global sections on your system. See Section 1.3 for
                 information on how to do this.

              2. Invoke the OpenVMS Install utility and install Compaq
                 COBOL as a shared image, as follows:

                 $ INSTALL   <Return>

                 INSTALL> ADD SYS$SYSTEM:COBOL.EXE/OPEN/SHARED   <Return>
                 INSTALL> ADD SYS$MESSAGE:COBOLMSG.EXE/OPEN/SHARED   <Return>
                 INSTALL> EXIT   <Return>

              3. Update the system startup file to install Compaq COBOL.

              To ensure that Compaq COBOL is installed as a shared
              image each time the system is bootstrapped, include
              the following lines in the site-specific startup file
              SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM or SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_
              VMS.COM (SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM has been changed to
              SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM for OpenVMS V6.2 and higher).

              $ INSTALL ADD SYS$SYSTEM:COBOL.EXE/OPEN/SHARED
              $ INSTALL ADD SYS$MESSAGE:COBOLMSG.EXE/OPEN/SHARED

        2.5 Using the PCSI Transition Kit to Register Compaq COBOL V5.7
            and the COBRTL

              After the installation of Compaq COBOL V5.7 has been
              completed, the installer on OpenVMS VAX V6.2 and higher can
              use five new files delivered with this kit to register the
              COBOL compiler and the COBRTL in the POLYCENTER Software
              Installation utility (PCSI) database. These files are
              placed in your SYS$UPDATE directory. These files are:

                                             Installing Compaq COBOL 2-13

 







              DEC-VAXVMS-COBOL-V0507--6.PCSI$DESCRIPTION
              DEC-VAXVMS-COBOL-V0507--6.PCSI$TLB
              DEC-VAXVMS-COBRTL-V0506--6.PCSI$DESCRIPTION
              DEC-VAXVMS-COBRTL-V0506--6.PCSI$TLB
              COBOL_PCSI_REGISTER.COM

              The first four files provide binary product information
              for the product registrations. They constitute a PCSI
              transition kit for the COBOL compiler and another for the
              COBRTL. The fifth file, COBOL_PCSI_REGISTER.COM, contains
              two DCL PRODUCT REGISTER commands, which accomplish the two
              registrations.

              After the successful completion of the kit using VMSINSTAL
              as shown in the Installation Guide, you can execute the
              following @ command at the DCL prompt:

              $ @COBOL_PCSI_REGISTER

              The procedure will ask you twice if you wish to continue:
              once for COBOL V5.7 and once for COBRTL V5.6. Answer Y to
              both inquiries. This procedure will take approximately one
              minute to execute.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The file COBOL_PCSI_REGISTER.COM is only for OpenVMS
                VAX V6.2 or higher, which has the PRODUCT command. A
                user of OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2 who attempts to execute
                this file will receive only diagnostic messages
                indicating that the PRODUCT command was not found
                by the command processor.

                WARNING: You are strongly urged not to remove these
                two registrations from the PCSI database. They will
                not need to be redone. Their purpose is to tell PCSI
                that you have the COBOL and COBRTL software installed
                on your system. Further, the only PCSI command that
                could remove these database entries is the DCL command
                PRODUCT REMOVE, which would not only remove the
                references to the COBOL and COBRTL software from the
                database, but would also remove all traces of the
                named software from your system, and this software
                would have to be reinstalled from scratch.

                                                       After Installation


              Compaq COBOL is now installed on your local system and can
              be invoked by all users with the COBOL command.

              The installation procedure modifies the DCL command table
              so that the COBOL command is recognized and processed.
              However, the previous command table is still in effect
              for those users who are currently logged in. All logged in
              users who want to use the newly installed version of Compaq
              COBOL should issue the following command:

              $ SET COMMAND/TABLE=SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES   <Return>

              If Compaq COBOL will be used extensively on your system,
              you can reduce system overhead and memory requirements
              by installing it as a shared image by using the OpenVMS
              Install utility. For more information, see Section 2.4.

        3.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is run
              at installation. If you want to run the IVP separately
              to ensure the integrity of installed files, execute the
              following command procedure:

              $ @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.COBOL]COBOL$IVP.COM   <Return>

              If the IVP fails for any reason, the following messages are
              displayed:

              The Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX V5.n Installation
              Verification Procedure failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX
              V5.n has failed.


                                                   After Installation 3-1

 







              What to Do If the Installation Fails During or After
              Running the IVP

              Some causes of installation failure after running the IVP
              can produce error messages such as the following:

              %CLI-F-SYNTAX, error parsing ...

              %COBOL-F-BADVALUE ...

              These errors indicate an incompatibility between
              SYS$SYSTEM:COBOL.EXE and the COBOL command syntax in
              SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES. To understand the causes of such
              errors and to correct them, follow this procedure:

              1. If either SYS$SYSTEM:COBOL.EXE or SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES
                 exists in SYS$SPECIFIC, the SYS$SPECIFIC file will
                 override the file in SYS$COMMON (where the installation
                 procedure places these files). Ensure that neither of
                 these files exists in SYS$SPECIFIC.

              2. Deassign any logical names for COBOL or DCLTABLES.

              3. If neither 1 nor 2 applies and you are in the same
                 account on the same node where Compaq COBOL was
                 installed, this error indicates that DCLTABLES was not
                 updated. This error usually occurs when another user had
                 DCLTABLES locked during the installation procedure. To
                 correct the error, you must reinstall Compaq COBOL.

              Other causes of installation failure after running the
              IVP can produce RPC$SHARE error messages. Such errors
              occur because Compaq COBOL accesses RPC$SHARE indirectly
              through CDDSHR.EXE (if you have a version of CDD prior to
              Version 5.0) and usually indicate a problem with the Oracle
              CDD/Repository installation. To correct these errors,
              execute the following command procedure:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:CDDSTRTUP.COM   <Return>

              If you encounter other errors after executing this command
              procedure, consult the Oracle CDD/Repository documentation
              for further information or contact your Customer Support
              Center.

        3.2 Customizing Compaq COBOL Error Messages

              If you choose to customize the Compaq COBOL message file,
              the installation procedure copies the Compaq COBOL message
              file COBOLMSG.MSG into the system directory [SYSUPD]. After
              the file is copied to the system directory, you can edit
              COBOLMSG.MSG to customize the error messages that users
              receive when using Compaq COBOL. Customized messages are
              often desirable for international users.

              There are two prerequisites:

              o  You must install Compaq COBOL before editing the message
                 file. If you install Compaq COBOL after editing the
                 message file, the software installation's COBOLMSG.MSG
                 file will supersede your revised message file in the
                 [SYSMSG] directory.

              o  You must have the OpenVMS Message utility installed
                 on your system before editing COBOLMSG.MSG. The edited
                 version of COBOLMSG.MSG must be processed through the
                 Message utility before the file can be accessed by
                 Compaq COBOL.

              The following steps explain how to edit the Compaq COBOL
              messages and install the customized message file on your
              system:

              1. Run the Compaq COBOL installation procedure and answer
                 YES to the question "Do you want to save the COBOL
                 message file for modification [NO]?"

                 The installation procedure copies the message file,
                 COBOLMSG.MSG, into the system directory [SYSUPD].

              2. Edit the message file in [SYSUPD].

                 Each error message appears on a separate line and is
                 enclosed in angle brackets (< >). You can edit the text
                 portion of the error messages, but for Compaq COBOL
                 to correctly identify the error messages, you must not
                 change the following:

                 o  The 3- to 9-character mnemonic that appears in the
                    first column

                 o  The sequence in which the error messages appear in
                    the file

                 o  The severity level of the error message

                                                   After Installation 3-3

 







                 o  The number, type, and order of the formatted ASCII
                    ouput (FAO) arguments that appear in the message

              3. Run the OpenVMS Message utility.

                 To translate the new message text into a file that
                 Compaq COBOL can access, process the text file through
                 the Message utility by entering the following command:

                 $ MESSAGE COBOLMSG   <Return>

                 The Message utility creates the object module
                 COBOLMSG.OBJ.

              4. Enter the LINK command with the /SHARE qualifier to
                 create the shareable image COBOLMSG.EXE:

                 $ LINK/SHARE COBOLMSG   <Return>

              5. Copy COBOLMSG.EXE into the system directory [SYSMSG]:

                 $ COPY COBOLMSG.EXE SYS$COMMON:[SYSMSG]/PROT=W:RE   <Return>

              6. If Compaq COBOL is installed as a known image, you
                 must reinstall COBOLMSG.EXE by entering the following
                 command:

                 $ INSTALL REPLACE SYS$MESSAGE:COBOLMSG   <Return>

              Compaq COBOL will now generate your customized error
              messages.

        3.3 Error Conditions

              If the installation procedure fails for any reason, a
              message like the following is displayed:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of Compaq COBOL V5.n
              has failed.

              An error during the installation can occur if one or more
              of the following conditions exist:

              o  Operating system version is incorrect.

              o  Prerequisite software version is incorrect.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 insufficient (see Section 1.3).

              o  Process quotas required by VMSINSTAL are incorrect (see
                 Section 2.1).

        3-4 After Installation

 







              o  OpenVMS Help library is currently in use.

              o  Product Authorization Key (PAK) was registered
                 incorrectly or not registered.

              For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
              conditions, see the OpenVMS system messages
              documentation,your processor-specific
              installation or operations guide, or the OpenVMS License
              Management Utility Manual.

              If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
              take the appropriate action as described in the message.
              You may need to change a system parameter or increase an
              authorized quota value.

              If the installation fails, you must restart the
              installation procedure from Step 2. The installation
              may fail due to an IVP failure. If so, you should first
              consult the instructions in Section 3.1. If you still
              need assistance, contact your Compaq field service
              representative or the Customer Support Center if you have
              support.

        3.4 Special Save Set for COBRTL Only

              Within the COBOL057.C save set, there is another save set
              named COBRTL057.A containing files needed to install only
              the COBOL Run-Time Library (COBRTL) image. Although most
              users have no need of this, you may find this save set
              useful if you are a vendor distributing Compaq COBOL for
              OpenVMS VAX systems applications to your customers, and
              have experienced incompatibility problems with the version
              of the COBRTL on your customers' systems in the past. You
              can distribute the COBRTL057.A save set with your COBOL
              application to enable your customers to install the COBRTL
              on their VAX systems. Note that the COBRTL.EXE image is
              identical to the COBRTL.EXE image shipped on the main kit.

              To extract the COBRTL057.A save set, copy the save set
              COBOL057.C from your media to your default directory, and
              do the following:

  $ BACKUP COBOL057.C/SAVE/SELECT=COBRTL057.A destination-directory   <Return>

                                                   After Installation 3-5

 







              The COBRTL057.A save set can then be distributed to
              customers with your Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX systems
              application and installed on their system with the
              VMSINSTAL utility, as described in Step 5 in Section 2.2.
              Note that there is no problem with licensing, as the
              COBRTL.EXE can be copied to any properly licensed OpenVMS
              VAX system.

        3.5 Maintenance Updates

              Compaq may periodically issue maintenance updates of
              Compaq COBOL. Each update consists of an installation kit.
              Install this kit as described in this document or in any
              documentation that may accompany the maintenance update.

              Each time a maintenance update is released, the version
              number changes. For example, if the current version is 1.0,
              the version number of the first maintenance update will be
              1.1. The maintenance update also includes new release notes
              that describe the changes that have been made to Compaq
              COBOL since the previous release.

              The updated release notes are provided on line. You should
              read the release notes when you first install Compaq COBOL;
              they are also accessible at any time after the product is
              installed. For information on reading the release notes
              at the time that you install Compaq COBOL, follow the
              installation procedure through Step 4 in Chapter 2. To
              locate the release notes after Compaq COBOL is installed,
              display or print the file SYS$HELP:COBOLver.RELEASE_NOTES
              or type the following:

              $ HELP COBOL RELEASE_NOTES   <Return>

                                                   Recovering from Errors


              This appendix provides information to help you with
              failures or errors that might occur during product
              installation or product use.

        C.1 Failures During Installation of Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX
            Systems

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks if you want to continue the
              installation. In some instances, you can enter YES to
              continue. To stop the installation process and correct
              the situation, enter NO and press Return. Then correct the
              problem and restart the installation.

              If errors occur during the installation itself or when
              the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is running,
              VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
              fails, you see the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of Compaq COBOL V5.n
              has failed.

              If the IVP fails, you see these messages:

              The Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX V5.n Installation Verification
              Procedure failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for Compaq COBOL for OpenVMS VAX
              V5.n has failed.

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exist:

              o  The operating system version is incorrect.

              o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

                                               Recovering from Errors C-1

 







              o  System parameter values for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  The OpenVMS Help library is currently in use.

              o  The product license has not been registered and loaded.

              For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
              conditions, see the OpenVMS VAX documentation on system
              messages, recovery procedures, and OpenVMS VAX software
              installation. If you are notified that any of these
              conditions exist, you should take the appropriate action
              as described in the message. Also see Section 3.1 and
              Section 3.3.

              For information on installation requirements, see
              Chapter 1.

        C.2 Diagnostic Message Table

              Table C-1 shows the messages that can occur during your
              installation and the actions you can take in response:
