                                   Preparing to Install Compaq Pascal


          This chapter discusses the preparations and requirements
          necessary for installing Compaq Pascal Version 5.7.

          Your bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report
          (BIL) specify the number and contents of your media.
          Be sure to verify the contents of your kit with this
          information. If your kit is damaged or if you find
          that parts of it are missing, contact your Compaq
          representative.

          Compaq Pascal provides online release notes, which are
          copied to the following file during installation:

          SYS$HELP:PASCAL05n.RELEASE_NOTES

          Compaq strongly recommends that you read the release notes
          before proceeding with the installation. For information on
          accessing the online release notes, see Section 2.1.

          Your distribution kit includes a "Read First" cover letter.
          Please read this cover letter for information that is
          important for you to know before installing Compaq Pascal.
          This information may not be included in this installation
          guide or in the release notes.

    1.1 Required Operating System Components

          Compaq Pascal Version 5.7 requires OpenVMS Alpha Version
          6.1 or higher, or OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5 or higher. Future
          Compaq Pascal releases may require higher versions of
          the OpenVMS operating system, as described in the online
          release notes or the Read First cover letter for your
          operating system.

          The OpenVMS operating system comes with a variety of
          support options or components.

1.2  Optional Software

      The following is a list of optional software that you can
      use with
      Compaq Pascal:

      o  Oracle CDD/Repository

      o  DECset

1.3  License Registration

      You must register the Compaq Pascal license through the
      OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF) in accordance
      with the license agreement signed by your site. The
      license registration information you need is contained
      in the Product Authorization Key (PAK) that is shipped
      with Compaq Pascal if you ordered the license and media
      together; otherwise, the PAK is shipped separately to a
      location based on your license order. The PAK is a paper
      certificate that contains information about the license to
      run a particular piece of software.

      If you are installing Compaq Pascal as an update on a
      node or cluster that is licensed for this software,
      you have already completed the License PAK registration
      requirements.

      During the installation, the system asks whether you
      have registered the Compaq Pascal license and loaded the
      appropriate PAK. Before you start the installation, you
      must register and load your license for Compaq Pascal to be
      able to run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
      and for users to be able to run Compaq Pascal.

      To register a license, first log in to the system manager's
      account (username: SYSTEM). You then have a choice of two
      ways to perform the registration:

      o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it
         prompts you for information, respond with data from your
         License PAK.



1-2  Preparing to Install Compaq Pascal

 







          o  At the DCL prompt ($),  enter the LICENSE REGISTER
             command with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond
             to License PAK information.

          For complete information on using LMF, see the manual on
          the License Management Utility in the OpenVMS documentation
          set.

    1.4 Multiple Version Support

          Compaq Pascal provides support for using multiple versions
          of the compliler on the same OpenVMS system.

          During installation, you have the opportunity to save
          the current version of the compiler for later use. If
          chosen, the installation copies the current compiler before
          installing the new compiler.

          The kit provides 3 command files to display and control
          which Compaq Pascal compiler is used.

          o  SYS$SYSTEM:PASCAL$SHOW_VERSIONS.COM is used to display
             all Compaq Pascal compilers saved on the system and
             their version numbers. It also shows the current
             settings for process, job, group, and system-wide
             compiler settings. This command file has no parameters.

          o  SYS$SYSTEM:PASCAL$SET_VERSION.COM is used to select a
             Compaq Pascal compiler other than SYS$SYSTEM:PASCAL.EXE.
             If invoked without parameters, it will display the
             currently available compilers and ask for a filename
             to use for the process-wide compiler setting. It has
             2 optional parameters. The first parameter can be
             PROCESS, JOB, GROUP, or SYSTEM. This selects the level
             of visibility for the selected compiler. The second
             parameter can be a filename to use instead of being
             prompted for a file. This allows you to place a compiler
             selection in a LOGIN.COM or some other command file. All
             saved compilers are located in SYS$SYSTEM:.

          o  SYS$SYSTEM:PASCAL$DEFAULT_VERSION.COM is used
             to select the default Compaq Pascal compiler
             when SYS$SYSTEM:PASCAL$SET_VERSION.COM has not
             be used. The installation always provides a new
             SYS$SYSTEM:PASCAL.EXE and copies existing compilers.
             You can use this command file to select one of the
             saved compilers to be SYS$SYSTEM:PASCAL.EXE and rename

                               Preparing to Install Compaq Pascal 1-3

 







         the existing SYS$SYSTEM:PASCAL.EXE for later use via
         SYS$SYSTEM:PASCAL$SET_VERSION.COM.

1.5  Installation Procedure Requirements

      The installation of Compaq Pascal takes approximately 5 to
      45 minutes, depending on your system configuration.

1.5.1  Installation Account Privileges and Disk Space

      To install Compaq Pascal, you must be logged in to
      an account that has SETPRV or at least the following

         file shipped with the OpenVMS operating system kit.
         This allows the same Compaq Pascal kit to produce
         STARLET files that reflect the version of OpenVMS
         being used on the system.

         Since updating the version of OpenVMS may add new
         definitions, the peak and net block count requirements
         for installing Compaq Pascal (see Table 1-1) may not
         always be accurate.

         The values in Table 1-1 are meant to accommodate the
         larger definition files.

         ______________________________________________________

1.5.2  System Parameters

      Installing Compaq Pascal requires certain system parameter
      settings.

      The minimum number of free global pagelets (512-
      byte subpage unit) and global sections needed for the
      installation depends on whether SYS$SYSTEM:PASCAL.EXE was
      previously installed as a shared image, as follows:

      o  If not previously installed as a shared image:

         -  One global section and a sufficient number of
            contiguous free global pagelets to contain the file
            SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE.

      o  If previously installed as a shared image or will be
         subsequently installed with the PASCAL$STARTUP command
         file (Section 3.4.2)

         -  Two global sections and a sufficient number of
            contiguous free global pagelets to contain the file
            SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE.

             -  8,500 additional global pagelets on OpenVMS Alpha
                systems.

             -  1,500 additional global pagelets on OpenVMS VAX
                systems.

          These values represent the number of free global pagelets
          and global sections required for the installation, not
          the total number you need to run your system and other
          software.

         ________________________ Note ________________________

         If you do not ensure that your system has the
         necessary global pagelets and global section SYSGEN
         parameters for the installation, the DCL tables can
         become corrupted in some situations.

         ______________________________________________________

1.5.2.1  Calculating the Values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS

      To install and run Compaq Pascal, you must have sufficient
      free contiguous global pagelets and global sections.
      To determine the number of global pagelets required by
      SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE, enter the following DCL command:

      $ DIR/SIZE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE

      This command returns the size (in blocks) of
      SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE. As an approximation, use this
      figure as the number of global pagelets for the file.

      To find the number of free contiguous global pagelets
      and free global sections, use the WRITE command with the
      F$GETSYI lexical function. The following example shows how
      to get this information at your terminal (the default for
      SYS$OUTPUT):

      $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("CONTIG_GBLPAGES")
      15848
      $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")
      24

      If the value of free global pagelets or global sections
      is less than the required value (see Section 1.5.2), you
      must increase the system parameter setting. Section 1.5.2.2
      describes the procedures for increasing these values using
      AUTOGEN.

1.5.2.2  Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN

      If you do not have enough free global pagelets or free
      global sections to install Compaq Pascal, you can do either
      of the following:

      o  Delete an existing known image using the OpenVMS Install
         Utility.

1-8  Preparing to Install Compaq Pascal

 







          o  Use the AUTOGEN command procedure to increase the
             GBLPAGES or GBLSECTIONS system parameters.

          AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for parameters that
          are associated with the values you reset manually. To
          change system parameters with AUTOGEN, edit the following
          file:

          SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

          To change a parameter value listed in this file, delete the
          current value associated with that parameter and enter the
          new value.

          To add a new parameter, insert a line in the file that
          includes both the name of the parameter and its value. For
          example:

          WSMAX = 1024

          To modify incremental parameters such as GBLPAGES and
          GBLSECTIONS, use ADD_. The following example increases
          the global pagelet setting by 2000:

          ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000

            ________________________ Note ________________________

            When you set the page file quota, do not use a value
            that exceeds the amount of page file space available
            on the system.

            ______________________________________________________

          After you make all your changes, exit from the editor and
          then execute the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your
          system parameters. Enter the following command at the DCL
          prompt to recalculate your system parameters and to reboot
          the system:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

          When you specify REBOOT, AUTOGEN does an automatic system
          shutdown and then reboots the system. Any users logged
          on to the system are immediately disconnected during the
          shutdown. The automatic reboot puts the new parameter
          values into effect.

                               Preparing to Install Compaq Pascal 1-9

 







      AUTOGEN automatically adjusts some of the SYSGEN
      parameters, based on the consumption of resources since the
      last reboot. If you do not want to take advantage of this
      automatic adjustment, include the /NOFEEDBACK qualifier on
      the AUTOGEN command line.

      For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the OpenVMS
      System Management Subkit.

    1.5.3 Backing Up Your System Disk

          At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if you
          have backed up your system disk. Compaq recommends that you
          do a system disk backup before installing Compaq Pascal or
          any other software.

          Use the backup procedures that are established at your
          site. For details on performing a system disk backup, see
          the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS system
          management documentation.

    1.6 Stopping the Installation

          To stop the installation procedure at any time, use Ctrl/C.
          However, files created up to that point are not deleted.
          You must then delete these files interactively. Chapter 2
          lists the directories and files created during the
          Compaq Pascal installation.

    1.6.1 Reader's Comments

          Compaq appreciates your comments. If you find errors or
          want to comment about this manual, please send the manual

                                             Installing Compaq Pascal


          This chapter explains how to install Compaq Pascal:

          o  Section 2.1 contains a step-by-step description of the
             installation procedure.

          o  Section 2.2 describes error recovery considerations.

          For a sample Compaq Pascal installation, see Appendix A.

    2.1 Installation Procedure

          The Compaq Pascal installation procedure consists of
          a series of questions and informational messages. See
          Appendix A for a sample Compaq Pascal installation.

          If you have not already done so, insert the Compact Disc
          (CD) or tape media into the CD drive or tape drive.

          To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
          Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
          deletes all files it has created up to that point and
          exits. You can then start the installation again.

          When the system prompts you with a question during the
          installation procedure, the default answer, if any, is
          enclosed in brackets ([]).

          To start the installation:

          1. Invoke the VMSINSTAL command procedure.

             You should invoke the VMSINSTAL command procedure from
             privileged account, such as the SYSTEM account. The
             VMSINSTAL procedure is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. For
             example:

                                         Installing Compaq Pascal 2-1

 







         Username: SYSTEM
         Password:

         $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
         $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL (saveset-name)  (device-name)  [option-list]








































2-2  Installing Compaq Pascal

 







             The following list defines the elements of the VMSINSTAL
             procedure:

             saveset-name
             The installation name for the component. For Compaq
             Pascal, use the following installation name:

                  PASCAL05n

             To obtain the directory location of the Compaq Pascal
             saveset on the CD, refer to the OpenVMS Alpha Layered
             Products Disc User's Guide that accompanies the CD
             distribution kit. Or, you can do the following before
             starting the installation:

             o  To determine whether the CD drive is already mounted,
                enter the following command:

                $ SHOW DEVICE DKA400:

                If it is not mounted, enter the appropriate
                MOUNT command to mount the CD (omit the /FOREIGN
                qualifier).

             o  To obtain the directory name, enter the following
                command:

                $ DIRECTORY DKA400:[000000]*pascal*.dir
                Directory DKA400:[000000]
                PASCAL05n.DIR;1

             o  To obtain the saveset name, use the DIRECTORY command
                specifying the directory file from the previous
                command:

                $ DIRECTORY DKA400:[PASCAL05n.KIT]*.A

             device-name
             The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
             media and the directory containing the Compaq Pascal
             save set. In the following example, the device name is
             DKA400: and the directory is [PASCAL05n.KIT]. For tape
             installations, just enter the name of the tape device.

             To specify the device name on the @VMSINSTAL command
             line, enter:

                   DKA400:[PASCAL05n.KIT]

                                         Installing Compaq Pascal 2-3

 







         DKA400: is the name of the CD drive used in the rest of
         the examples in this guide.

         option-list
         The word OPTIONS followed by one or more of the
         following option designators: A, L, N, R. Their meanings
         are as follows:

         o  Auto_answer option (A)

            Initially creates a file that contains your answers
            to VMSINSTAL questions and prompts. You can then use
            the option (and the answer file) to save time during
            a reinstallation (typically after upgrading your
            system).

         o  File log option (L)

            Logs all activity to the terminal during
            installation.

         o  Display or print the release notes (N)

            Indicates that you want to see the installation
            question on release notes. If you do not include
            the OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does not ask
            you about the release notes. You should review the
            release notes before proceeding with the installation
            in case they contain additional information about the
            installation. If you are restarting the installation
            and have already reviewed the release notes, you do
            not need to specify OPTIONS N.

         ________________________ Note ________________________

         Even if you omit the N option when you invoke
         VMSINSTAL, the Compaq Pascal release notes are copied
         automatically to the SYS$HELP directory.

         ______________________________________________________

         o  Alternate root option (R)

            Allows you to install the product to a system root
            other than that of the running system.

         For detailed information on these VMSINSTAL options, see
         the OpenVMS documentation on software installation in
         the OpenVMS System Management Subkit.

2-4  Installing Compaq Pascal

 







             If you specify multiple options, use commas to separate
             the options, for example:

             OPTIONS A,N

             When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

             o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account

                Compaq recommends that you install software from the
                system manager's account with your default device and
                directory set to SYS$UPDATE.

             o  Whether you have sufficient quotas for installation

             This following example invokes VMSINSTAL to install
             Compaq Pascal and shows the system response. This
             example uses the OPTIONS N release note option.

             $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL PASCAL05n DKA400:[PASCAL05n.kit] OPTIONS N

                 OpenVMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.n

             It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
             Enter a question mark (?)  at any time for help.

             If you do not supply the product name or the device
             name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information later
             in the installation procedure. VMSINSTAL does not prompt
             you for any options, so be sure to include whatever
             option you want on the VMSINSTAL command line.

          2. Confirm system backup.

             * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

             VMSINSTAL asks if you are satisfied with your system
             backup. You should always back up your system disk
             before performing an installation. If you are satisfied
             with the backup of your system disk, press the
             Return key. Otherwise, enter NO to discontinue the
             installation. After you back up your system disk, you
             can restart the installation.

             If you fail to include the device name of the VMSINSTAL
             command line, the following prompt is displayed:

             * Where will the distribution volumes be mounted:

             If this prompt is displayed, type the name of the
             distribution (media)  device and directory that contains

                                         Installing Compaq Pascal 2-5

 







         the Compaq Pascal kit (save  set). For example, if the
         media is contained on a CD located on unit DKA400:, type
         DKA400:[PASCAL05n.KIT] in reply to this question, as
         shown in the following example:

         * Where will the distribution volumes be mounted:DKA400:[PASCAL05n.KIT]







































2-6  Installing Compaq Pascal

 







          3. Verify the product being installed.

             The following products will be processed:

             PASCAL V5.n

             Beginning installation of PASCAL V5.n at hh:mm

             %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

             The product name and version are displayed. The
             first save set (A)  is restored to a subdirectory of
             SYS$UPDATE.

          4. Select a release notes option.

             Release notes included with this kit are always copied to SYS$HELP.

             Additional Release Notes Options:

                 1.  Display release notes
                 2.  Print release notes
                 3.  Both 1 and 2
                 4.  None of the above

             * Select option [2]:

             If you specified OPTIONS N when you invoked VMSINSTAL,
             you are now asked to choose one of the four options for
             reviewing the release notes:

             o  If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the
                release notes immediately on the console terminal.
                You can terminate the display at any time by pressing
                Ctrl/C.

             o  If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for the
                name of the print queue that you want to use:

                * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]:

                You can then enter a queue name or press Return to
                send the file to the default output print device.

             o  If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the
                release notes immediately on the console terminal
                and then prompts you for a queue name for the printed
                version of the release notes.

         o  If you choose option 4, the release notes are not
            displayed or printed but are still copied to the
            following file in the SYS$HELP directory:

            SYS$HELP:PASCAL05n.RELEASE_NOTES








































2-8  Installing Compaq Pascal

 







             You can later use the HELP command to find the location
             of the release notes in the Help facility:

             $ HELP PASCAL RELEASE_NOTES

             Whichever option you choose, VMSINSTAL next asks the
             following question:

             * Do you want to continue the installation [NO]?: YES
             %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product's release notes have been
                     successfully moved to SYS$HELP.

             To continue the installation, enter YES. Otherwise,
             press Return. In either case, the release notes are
             copied to a file in the SYS$HELP directory:

             SYS$HELP:PASCAL057.RELEASE_NOTES

            ________________________ Note ________________________

            The name of the release notes file installed by
            VMSINSTAL consists of the current product name (in
            this case, PASCAL) and version number (in this case,
            057 for Version 5.7). Do not delete release notes for
            previous versions of Compaq Pascal.

            ______________________________________________________

          5. Install the compiler.

             * Do you want to install the Compaq Pascal compiler [YES]?

             The Compaq Pascal kit contains the compiler, message
             files, command line definition, and help files.

          6. Install STARLET.

             * Do you want to install the Compaq Pascal definition files [YES]?

             The Compaq Pascal kit contains definition files for
             OpenVMS System Services and several run-time library
             facility codes. These system definition files are built
             using information shipped with the OpenVMS operating
             system.

             The installation procedure determines whether Compaq
             Pascal definition files already exist. If the files do
             not exist, the installation procedure notifies you of
             this and advises you to create the definition files.

         If the Compaq Pascal definition files exist, but
         the OpenVMS-supplied system definitions, which are
         the basis for the Compaq Pascal definition files,
         have been modified since the last time the Compaq
         Pascal definition files were created, the installation
         procedure advises you to recreate the files.

         If the Compaq Pascal definition files exist and if
         the OpenVMS-supplied system definitions have not been
         modified since the last time the
         Compaq Pascal definition files were created, the
         procedure tells you that it is not necessary to recreate
         the definition files.

      7. Install the examples.

         * Do you want to install the Compaq Pascal example programs [YES]?

         The Compaq Pascal kit contains a set of example
         programs using many features of Compaq Pascal and
         OpenVMS. The examples are installed in the directory
         SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.PASCAL]. You can access
         them using the logical PASCAL$EXAMPLES, if you run the
         optional startup file SYS$STARTUP:PASCAL$STARTUP.COM
         (see Section 3.3).

      8. Save previous compiler.

         * Do you want to save your existing Compaq Pascal compiler [NO]?

         The Compaq Pascal kit contains support to save your
         existing Compaq Pascal compiler for access later.
         The installation provides various command files to
         display and select the saved Compaq Pascal compilers.
         See Section 1.4 for more information.

      9. Purge files.

         * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

         You have the option to purge files from previous
         versions of Compaq Pascal that are superseded by this
         installation. Purging is recommended. If you answered
         YES to question 8, you can answer YES to this question
         with no danger of deleting any saved compilers.

      10.Choose the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
         option.

2-10  Installing Compaq Pascal

 







             The installation procedure now asks if you want to
             run the IVP. The IVP for Compaq Pascal checks that the
             installation is successful. Compaq recommends that you
             run the IVP.

             * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

             This kit contains an IVP that is used to verify the
             correct installation of the Compaq Pascal compiler. The
             IVP is located in:

             SYS$TEST:PASCAL$IVP.COM

             After Compaq Pascal is installed, you can run the IVP
             independently to verify that the software is available
             on your system. You might need to run the IVP after a
             system failure to make sure that users can access Compaq
             Pascal.

      11.Respond to license registration queries.

         Product:      PASCAL
         Producer:     Compaq
         Version:      5.7
         Release Date: dd-mmm-yyyy

         * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

         The installation procedure displays license information
         about your product and then asks if you have registered
         and loaded your Product Authorization Key (PAK).

         If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you must
         answer NO to this question. You must register and load
         your PAK to successfully complete the installation. If
         you have not done so, you should stop the installation,
         register and load your PAK, and then start the
         installation procedure again.

      12.Read informational messages.

         At this point, the installation procedure displays a
         number of informational messages that report on the
         progress of the installation. There are no further
         questions. If the installation procedure has been
         successful up to this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new
         or modified files to their target directories, updates
         help files, and updates DCL tables, if necessary. If you
         chose to have files purged, that work is done now. The
         following message is displayed:

         %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their
             target directories...

      13.Observe the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP).

         If you chose to run the IVP, VMSINSTAL runs it now.
         When the IVP runs successfully, you see the following
         messages displayed:

         ** Successful Installation of Compaq Pascal V5.7 on 14-APR-1999 at 13:35 **

            ________________________ Note ________________________

            VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process
            symbol tables during the installation. Therefore, if
            you are going to continue using the system manager's
            account and you want to restore these symbols, you
            should log out and log in again.

    2.2 Error Recovery

          If errors occur during the installation itself or when
          the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is running,
          VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
          fails, you see the following message:

          %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of Compaq Pascal V(n.n) has failed.

          If the IVP fails, you see these messages:

          The Compaq Pascal V(n.n) Installation Verification Procedure failed.

          %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for Compaq Pascal V(n.n) has failed.

          Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
          following conditions exist:

          o  The operating system version is incorrect.

          o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
             insufficient.

          o  System parameter values for successful installation are
             insufficient.

          o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

                                       After Installing Compaq Pascal


          Compaq Pascal is now installed and can be invoked by all
          users with the PASCAL command. The following tasks can be
          performed after installing Compaq Pascal:

          o  Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
             separately

          o  Editing the system startup and shutdown files

          o  Making the product usable on a VMScluster

          o  Enhancing performance

          o  Reporting problems

          The following sections describe these tasks in detail.

    3.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
        Separately

          You usually run the Installation Verification Procedure
          (IVP) during installation. If you want to run the IVP
          separately to ensure the integrity of installed files
          should system problems occur, execute the following command
          procedure:

          $ @SYS$TEST:PASCAL$IVP.COM

          If the IVP fails for any reason, the following message is
          displayed:

          Compaq Pascal VERSION V5.n TEST FAILED

    3.2 User Account Requirements

          Several products cannot be used unless certain privilege
          and quota requirements are met by user accounts. The
          following sections describe the privilege and quota
          requirements needed to work with Compaq Pascal.

                                   After Installing Compaq Pascal 3-1

 







3.2.1  Privileges

      Compaq Pascal does not require any special privileges.
      There is no benefit from installing the Compaq Pascal
      compiler with privileges.

3.2.2  Quotas

      See Section 3.4 for information.

3.3  Editing System Files

      You can edit the system startup file to provide for
      automatic startup of
      Compaq Pascal when your system is rebooted. Use the
      optional startup file to define the PASCAL$EXAMPLES logical
      name and to install Compaq Pascal as a shared image (see
      Section 3.4.2).

      Edit the system startup file SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM
      (or SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM on OpenVMS VAX V5.n
      systems) to include the following line:

      $ @sys$startup:pascal$startup.com

3.4  Enhancing Compaq Pascal Performance

      This section includes information on system tuning and
      explains how to install Compaq Pascal as a shared image.

3.4.1  Using Multiple Environment Files On OpenVMS VAX systems
       only

      If you intend to use multiple Compaq Pascal environment
      files, you can increase the compilation speed by modifying
      the FILLM quota of those processes that run the compiler.
      The Compaq Pascal compiler will keep more than one
      environment file open during the compilation (with a
      maximum of 50 environment files). If you inherit more than
      50 environment files, the compiler will close some of them
      in order to open other files.

    3.4.2 Installing Compaq Pascal as a Shared Image

          If you expect Compaq Pascal to be used extensively on
          your system, you can reduce the system overhead and memory
          requirements by installing it as a shared image.

          To install Compaq Pascal as a shared image on a system
          that is currently running, use the optional Compaq Pascal
          startup file:

               SYS$STARTUP:PASCAL$STARTUP.COM

          Compaq recommends that you install Compaq Pascal as shared
          on a system that has been rebooted recently because the
          available space in the global page table is less likely to
          be fragmented.

          The requirements for additional global pages and global
          sections are listed in section Section 1.5.2.

    3.4.3 Improving Compaq Pascal Compilation Performance on OpenVMS
          Alpha Systems

          For many user applications, the Compaq Pascal for OpenVMS
          Alpha compiler requires significantly more system resources
          than Compaq Pascal for OpenVMS VAX. The compiler will
          sometimes fail with a "%LIB-E-INSVIRMEM, insufficient
          virtual memory" error. Also, for very large programs
          (greater than 10,000 lines) there could be a report of
          an extremely long compile time.

          The following sections explain why Compaq Pascal for
          OpenVMS Alpha requires more memory, and suggests actions
          to be taken to avoid resource problems.

          The Alpha architecture is a RISC (Reduced Instruction
          Set Computer) architecture. The VAX architecture is a
          CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture.
          The main distinguishing characteristic of a RISC machine
          is that it has few instructions, and each instruction
          does a small amount of work. A CISC machine generally has
          many instructions, most of which perform many complicated
          operations in one step.

          By reducing the amount of work that is done in each
          instruction (and by reducing the number of instructions),
          the complexity of the hardware is reduced. This reduction
          in complexity allows the hardware designers to raise the

                                   After Installing Compaq Pascal 3-3

 







      clock speed (and thus the number of instructions per second
      that can be completed). This results in better overall
      system performance.

      Another characteristic of RISC systems is that compilers
      for these architectures generally must do a great deal more
      work than a corresponding compiler for a CISC architecture.

      For example, the compiler must compute the best way to use
      all of the functional units of the processor, and it must
      determine how to make the best use of registers and on-
      chip data cache because reads and writes to main memory are
      generally slow compared to the speed of the processor.

      The Compaq Pascal for OpenVMS Alpha compiler is a globally
      optimizing compiler. The compiler constructs an internal
      representation of the entire Pascal program, and repeatedly
      traverses this structure at compile time, so that it can
      produce the most efficient machine code for the program.
      This results in high performance code, but the drawback is
      that the compiler requires more resources than the Compaq
      Pascal for OpenVMS VAX compiler.























3-4  After Installing Compaq Pascal

 







          The Compaq Pascal for OpenVMS Alpha compiler will require
          more resources than the Compaq Pascal for OpenVMS VAX
          compiler because it must do more work. However, there are
          some things that can be done to reduce system resource
          usage:

          o  Use the /NOOPTIMIZE qualifier when "checking" programs.

             The optimizer is one of the biggest users of system
             resources in the Pascal compiler and is turned on by
             default. Also, the higher the optimization level, the
             more memory required by the compiler.

          o  Check system tuning.

             Since the Pascal compiler often needs a great deal
             of virtual memory, increase working-set limits for
             developers that use the compiler. This results in
             decreased paging and improvements in compile time.

          o  Check program sizes.

             The bigger the program is, the more resources it
             requires.

          Section 3.4.3.1 and Section 3.4.3.2 provide basic guidance
          about memory requirements for Compaq Pascal programs on
          OpenVMS Alpha.

          In many tuning exercises, it is instructive to work with a
          relatively quiet system, submit batch jobs, and retain the
          log files for later analysis.

            ________________________ Note ________________________

            The guidance in the following section is based on a
            study of a set of large modules. Please note that your
            results may differ.

            ______________________________________________________

          For detailed information on OpenVMS tuning, see the
          OpenVMS System Manager's Manual, sections "Managing System
          Parameters" and "Managing System Page, Swap, and Dump
          Files".

3.4.3.1  Required Virtual Memory

      If there is not enough virtual memory, the compile command
      may fail with the message "insufficient virtual memory".

      OpenVMS has two parameters that control the amount of
      virtual memory available to a process:

      o  The system generation parameter VIRTUALPAGECNT, which
         sets an upper bound on the number of pagelets of virtual
         memory for any process in the system.

      o  The AUTHORIZE parameter PGFLQUOTA, which determines the
         number of pagelets a process can reserve in the system's
         page file(s).

      After an "insufficient virtual memory" error, issue the
      following DCL command to see the Peak virtual size used by
      the process, or look at the Peak page file size at the end
      of a batch job's log:

      SHOW PROCESS/ACCOUNTING

      If the peak size is at the system generation parameter
      VIRTU you will need to raise this value. If the peak size
      is below VIRTUALPAGECNT, and at or above PGFLQUOTA, run
      AUTHORIZE to increase PGFLQUOTA for the Pascal users. Peak
      size can exceed PGFLQUOTA because some virtual memory, such
      as read-only image code, is not allocated page file space.

      It is difficult to predict precisely how much virtual
      memory will be required for a compilation, but a starting
      point for system tuning can be computed by either of the
      following:

      o  Multiply 250 times the size of the largest program in
         disk blocks (including all INCLUDE files referenced).

      o  Multiply 25 times the number of lines in the program
         (including all INCLUDE files.

      The resulting figure can then be used as a starting point
      for the system generation parameter VIRTUALPAGECNT. Place
      a line in the parameter file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT. For
      example, if you estimate 370,000 pages, add the following
      line in MODPARAMS, run AUTOGEN and reboot.

      MIN_VIRTUALPAGECNT = 400000

3-6  After Installing Compaq Pascal

 







          If the compilation now completes successfully, use the
          command SHOW PROCESS/ACCOUNTING to determine the Peak
          Virtual Size; if the actual peak is significantly less than
          the value computed above, you can reduce VIRTUALPAGECNT.

          When modifying VIRTUALPAGECNT and PGFLQUOTA, you may also
          need to increase the size of the page file.

    3.4.3.2 Required Physical Memory

          When dealing with physical memory you must know:

          o  If there enough memory on the system

          o  If enough available to the process running the
             compilation

          If the physical memory on the system is too small, the
          command LOGOUT/FULL (which is automatically issued at the
          end of a batch job) will show a high number of faults,
          for example, > 100,000 for a single compilation, and an
          "Elapsed time" that greatly exceeds the "Charged CPU time",
          as the system waits for disk I/Os to resolve page faults.
          In this situation, tuning attempts may be of limited
          benefit.

          If the physical memory on the system is adequate, but
          the physical memory allotted to the process running the
          compilation is too small, you may still observe a large
          number of faults, but elapsed time may remain closer to CPU
          time. This is because OpenVMS resolves page faults from the
          page caches (free list, modified list) whenever possible,
          avoiding the relatively slow disk I/Os. In this situation,
          basic tuning may also be beneficial.

          The amount of physical memory required will vary, but it
          should be a large fraction of the process peak virtual
          size-as close to 1.0 as practical. The reason for this is
          that the compiler makes multiple passes over the internal
          representation of the program; therefore a page which falls
          out of the working set in one pass is probably going to be
          needed again on the very next pass.

          The physical memory present on the system can be determined
          by the command SHOW MEMORY/PHYSICAL. The physical memory
          used by the compilation is reported as "Peak working set
          size" by the command SHOW PROCESS/ACCOUNTING or at the end
          of a batch log file.

                                   After Installing Compaq Pascal 3-7

 







      More physical memory can be made available to a process
      by minimizing the number of competing processes on the
      system (for example, by compiling one module at a time, or
      scheduling large compiles for off hours.)

      It can also be made available to a process (if it is
      present on the machine) by adjusting the system generation
      parameter WSMAX and the corresponding WSEXTENT (in
      AUTHORIZE). Such adjustments must be attempted with great
      caution, as the system may hang if memory is oversubscribed
      and you create a situation where OpenVMS effectively has no
      options to reclaim memory.

      The following guidelines have been found useful:

      o  Set the Pascal users' WSEXTENT (in AUTHORIZE or
         INITIALIZE/QUEUE) to match WSMAX.

      o  Keep WSQUOTA (in AUTHORIZE or INITIALIZE/QUEUE)
         low. Make sure that no process or batch queue has a
         WSQUOTA of more than about 20% of physical memory. The
         difference between WSEXTENT and WSQUOTA allows OpenVMS
         to manage memory to meet varying demands.

      o  Use AUTOGEN. AUTOGEN will attempt to make a consistent
         set of changes that do not interfere with each other.

         By default, AUTOGEN will set the maximum working set
         (system generation parameter WSMAX) to 25% of physical
         memory. This value is reasonable for a workstation or
         multi-user system with many active processes.

      o  WSMAX can be increased to a somewhat larger value by
         editting MODPARAMS.DAT. For a system with 64 MByte of
         physical memory, try setting WSMAX to no more than about
         40% of physical memory, or 52000 pagelets. With 128
         MByte or more of physical memory, a setting of 50% of
         physical memory can be attempted.

    3.4.3.3 Effects of Physical Memory

          The effects of physical memory on compilation time
          were studied for a set of seven large modules. The
          modules ranged in size from about 1600 to 3300 disk
          blocks. Your results may differ; but to help to give a
          rough appreciation for the effect of physical memory on
          compilation time, the following can be noted:

          o  When the amount of physical memory available to the
             processes matched the amount of virtual memory, the
             elapsed times were close to the CPU times.

          o  As the physical memory was reduced, CPU times rose only
             slightly, about ten percent.

          o  As the physical memory was reduced, elapsed times were
             elongated, at the rate of about one hour for each 100MB
             of difference between Peak Virtual Size and the actual
             memory available. For example, when compiling a program
             that used a Peak Virtual Size of 947760 pagelets,
             or 463MB (1MB = 2048 pagelets), on a system where
             about 180MB of physical memory was available to user
             processes, the compile required about three hours longer
             than on a 512MB system.

          Your results will be strongly affected by the speed of the
          devices that are used for paging. Both virtual memory and
          physical memory requirements can be reduced by breaking
          large modules up into smaller modules.

    3.5 Determining and Reporting Problems

          If an error occurs while using Compaq Pascal and you
          believe the error is caused by a problem with Compaq
          Pascal, take one of the following actions:

          o  If you have a basic or DECsupport Software Agreement,
             call your Customer Support Center (CSC). The CSC
             provides telephone support for high-level advisory and
             remedial assistance.

          o  If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement, you
             can submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

          o  If you purchased Compaq Pascal within the last 90 days
             and you think the problem is caused by a software error,
             you can submit an SPR.

                                   After Installing Compaq Pascal 3-9

 







      If you find an error in the Compaq Pascal documentation,
      please fill out one of the Reader's Comments forms at the
      back of the document containing the error and send the form
      to Compaq. Please include the section and page number where
      the error occurred.

      When you submit an SPR, please take the following steps:

      1. Describe as accurately as possible the state of the
         system and the circumstances when the problem occurred.
         Include in the description the version number of Compaq
         Pascal being used. Demonstrate the problem with specific
         examples.

      2. Reduce the problem to as small a size as possible.

      3. Provide a listing of the program. Remember to include
         listings of any command files, relevant data files, and
         so forth.

      4. If the program is longer than 50 lines, submit a copy of
         the program on machine-readable media (floppy diskette
         or magnetic tape). If necessary, also submit a copy of
         the program library used to build the application.

      5. Report only one problem per SPR. This will facilitate a
         faster response.

      6. Mail the SPR package to Compaq.

      Experience shows that many SPRs do not contain enough
      information to duplicate or identify the problem. Concise,
      complete information helps Compaq give accurate and timely
      service to software problems.

                                                  Sample Installation


          This appendix contains a sample installation of Compaq
          Pascal. This sample was run on a system that had no
          previous version of Compaq Pascal installed. Depending
          on which version of layered products or which version of
          OpenVMS you have on your system, you might see additional
          messages and questions when you perform your installation.

          The Compaq Pascal installation procedure installs several
          files on your system and defines some logical names.
          The file names are listed at the end of the installation
          procedure (see Appendix A).

          The PASCAL$EXAMPLES logical name is entered into the system
          logical name table when the PASCAL$STARTUP.COM command
          file is invoked. This name points to the location of the
          optional Compaq Pascal examples.

          The sample installation assumes that DECnet has been shut
          down, that no users are logged on to your system, and that
          OPTIONS N is specified to print the release notes. The
          Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs at the end
          of the installation.

       * Compaq Pascal V5.7 compiler, definition files, and examples *
       *-------------------------------------------------------------*

        The Compaq Pascal V5.7 kit contains the compiler, message files, command
        line definition and help files.  These files require 17000 blocks during
        installation and will occupy 16500 blocks after installation.

      * Do you want to install the Compaq Pascal compiler [YES]?

        The Compaq Pascal V5.7 kit contains definition files for OpenVMS System
        Services and several Run-Time Library Facility codes.  The definition
        files require 11500 blocks during installation and will occupy 10000
        blocks after installation.

        In addition, if you have Compaq Pascal compilers that were saved from prior
        upgrades, the definition files will be built with the oldest possible
        compiler to allow for the older compilers to inherit the newly constructed
        definition files.

        The OpenVMS-supplied system symbol definitions, which are the basis for
        Compaq Pascal definition files (STARLET.PAS and others), have not been
        modified since the last time the Compaq Pascal definition files were
        created.  It is not necessary to recreate the Compaq Pascal definition
        files at this time.

      * Do you want to install the Compaq Pascal definition files [YES]?

        For compatibility with existing programs, symbols in previous
        versions of STARLET.PAS will remain in STARLET.PAS even though the
        symbols might be associated with a run-time library.  For example,
        the SMG$K_* symbols are still in STARLET.PAS instead of
        PASCAL$SMG_ROUTINES.PAS, while the SMG$ entry points and the SMG message
        numbers are in PASCAL$SMG_ROUTINES.PAS.

        This kit provides several examples in SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.EXAMPLES.PASCAL].
        The names of the files reflect the topic being demonstrated by the programs.

        The IVP (Installation Verification Procedure) will be left in
        SYS$TEST:PASCAL$IVP.COM.  After the installation is complete, you
        can invoke the command file at any time to reverify that Compaq Pascal
        is installed and working correctly.

        An optional startup file has been placed in SYS$STARTUP:PASCAL$STARTUP.COM.
        The file installs the Compaq Pascal compiler, Run-Time Library, and
        message files as shared images to improve the performance of using
        the Compaq Pascal compiler or applications written in Compaq Pascal.
        If you wish to use this file, add the following DCL command to
        SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM

          $ @SYS$STARTUP:PASCAL$STARTUP.COM

        All questions regarding the installation have now been asked.
        The installation of Compaq Pascal V5.7 will now continue for 5
        to 45 minutes depending on your configuration and the options
        requested.
