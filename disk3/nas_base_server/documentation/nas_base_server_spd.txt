PRODUCT NAME:  NAS Base Server 200                     SPD 36.86.18
               Version 8.3A for OpenVMS VAX Systems

DESCRIPTION

Compaq NAS Base Server 200 Version 8.3A for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM]Systems
is a member of the NAS Client/Server Packages family. Each NAS Pack-
age is a software product providing a license for the NAS product and
documentation.

NAS Base Server 200 consists of a set of components that provide a server
run-time environment for distributed network applications on OpenVMS
VAX systems. These components, along with the operating system, pro-
vide uniform services that enable applications to be distributed in
heterogeneous client/server environments.

The NAS Version 8.3A release documents revisions to component prod-
ucts since the previous NAS release. NAS 8.3A supports Compaq Open-
VMS Operating System Version 7.3

Use of the components of NAS Base Server 200 Version 8.3A requires a
license for NAS Base Server 200 Version 8.3A in combination with the
OpenVMS VAX Operating System.

Table 1 lists the components included in NAS Base Server 200 for Open-
VMS VAX and summarizes license and media information for each compo-
nent. Special cases are covered by footnotes.

The License (L) column indicates whether or not the customer's NAS Base
Server 200 for OpenVMS VAX license includes the right to run each com-
ponent product. The Compaq NAS Packages do not license all components
referenced in this SPD.

                                                      November 2002

 

The version of each NAS component licensed, is as stated within the
Software Products Library of the calendar quarter in which the NAS PAK
is dated. Update licenses may be purchased for use of later versions
of any component.

The Media (M) column indicates whether or not the binaries are pro-
vided on the OpenVMS VAX Software Products Library CD-ROMs. Over time,
some kits may be retired. Check the current Software Products Library
Master Index for availability.

INSTALLATION

Compaq recommends that customers unfamiliar with the components of NAS
Base Server 200 for OpenVMS VAX Systems purchase Compaq Installation
Services. These services provide for installation of the software prod-
uct by an experienced Compaq Software Specialist.
Only software kits expressly identified in this SPD can be used to in-
stall components of NAS Base Server 200 for OpenVMS VAX Systems. Use
of other software kits may result in inoperable software configura-
tions and may invalidate the software product warranty or software ser-
vice contract.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The NAS Base Server 200 supports all valid OpenVMS VAX systems. For
questions about the hardware requirements for individual component prod-
ucts, customers should consult the HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS section of
individual component SPDs.

Memory Requirements

The minimum supported memory for installation of NAS Base Server 200
for OpenVMS VAX Systems, with all components and subcomponents installed,
is 32 MB.
The performance and memory usage of NAS Base Server 200 for OpenVMS
VAX and applications based on it are particularly sensitive to sys-
tem configuration. Full configuration of all subcomponents may require
memory in excess of the minimum quoted above. Additional memory may
also be required based on system loading and usage patterns of the com-
ponents.
More or less memory may be required depending on whether clients and
servers execute on the same system or on different systems. Additional
memory may also improve performance of one or more components.
Refer to the component SPDs and installation guides for detailed in-
formation about memory usage by components and subcomponents of the
NAS Base Server 200 for OpenVMS VAX.
