              Your bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report
              (BIL) specify the number and contents of your media.
              Be sure to verify the contents of your kit with this
              information. If your kit is damaged or if you find that
              parts of it are missing, contact your local support
              representative.

              Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX and the OpenVMS Version 6.0
              Debugger both provide online release notes, which are
              copied to SYS$HELP during installation. Compaq strongly
              recommends that you read the release notes before
              proceeding with the installation. For information on
              accessing the online release notes for the Compaq C++
              compiler, see step 5 in Section 2.2. For information on
              accessing the online release notes for the OpenVMS Version
              6.0 Debugger, see step 4 in Section 2.1.

        1.1 License Registration

              Before you install and run Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX on a
              newly licensed node (or cluster), you must first register
              a License Product Authorization Key (License PAK) using
              the License Management Facility (LMF). The License PAK may
              be shipped along with the kit if you ordered the license
              and media together; otherwise, it is shipped separately
              to a location based on your license order. If you are
              installing Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX as an update on
              a node or cluster already licensed for this software,
              you have already completed the License PAK registration
              requirements.

     Preparing for Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX Installation
     1.1 License Registration

           If you are installing prerequisite or optional software
           along with Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX, review the PAK
           status and install the PAKs for any prerequisite or
           optional software before you install Compaq C++ for
           OpenVMS VAX.

           The OpenVMS Debugger does not support the LMF, so
           there are no PAKs to register to run the debugger with
           Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX.

           You must register and load your license for Compaq C++
           for OpenVMS VAX before you start the installation to run
           the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and use the
           software.

           Log in to the system manager's account, SYSTEM. You have a
           choice of two ways to register a license:

           o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When
              it prompts you for information, respond with data from
              your License PAK.

           o  At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command
              with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to
              License PAK information.

           If you plan to use Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX on more
           than one node in a VMScluster, you will need to perform a
           license load on the other nodes after you complete this
           installation. See Section 3.3.

           For complete information on using the LMF, see the OpenVMS
           License Management Utility Manual.

     1.2 Required Operating System Components and Software

           Compaq C++ Version 5.6C for OpenVMS VAX requires the
           following components:

           o  OpenVMS VAX operating system Version 5.5-2 or higher.

              Future Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX releases may require
              higher versions of the operating system, as described
              in the online release notes or the Read Before
              Installing or Using Compaq C++ Version 5.6C for OpenVMS
              VAX letter.

                   1.2 Required Operating System Components and Software

              o  Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components Version 6.0 for
                 OpenVMS VAX kit.

                 Components of this kit include newer versions of
                 existing shareable image OpenVMS run-time components,
                 as well as the Compaq C++ Class Library and shareable
                 image components that are new to the Compaq C Run-Time
                 Library.

              The OpenVMS VAX operating system comes with a variety
              of support options or components. Components include
              such features as networking and RMS journaling. To use
              Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX, your system should be running
              a version of OpenVMS VAX that includes the base component
              and the following:

              o  Programming support

              o  Utilities

              The Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components kit is distributed on
              the same media with the Compaq C++ kit, and comes with its
              own installation instructions. You can redistribute the
              Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components kit and its documentation
              to remote sites that develop applications written in
              Compaq C++ Version 5.6C for OpenVMS VAX. See the Compaq
              C/C++ Run-Time Components for OpenVMS VAX Reference
              and Installation Guide for detailed installation and
              redistribution instructions.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Although they are both on the same media, you cannot
                install both the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger kit
                and the Compaq C++ Version 5.6C OpenVMS VAX kit with
                a single invocation of VMSINSTAL. The
                Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX kit causes VMSINSTAL
                to check to ensure that the OpenVMS Version 6.0
                Debugger installation is complete so that the
                Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) can test
                C++ debugging capabilities. If you try to install
                both kits with the same VMSINSTAL command, the
                Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX kit installs before
                the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger kit because the
                compiler kit files (CXX05n) alphabetically precede
                the debugger kit files (DBG060). Requests to install

     1.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

           This section discusses the settings that you should check
           to be sure that your system is ready for the installation
           of Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX to proceed.

     1.3.1 Deassigning DECset Debugger Logical Names

           Although carrying out the procedure in Section 2.1 updates
           the system version of the OpenVMS Debugger, it does not
           modify any auxiliary version of the OpenVMS Debugger
           that may also exist on your system, such as the version
           supplied with DECset Version 11 or supplied with older
           versions of Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX. If they exist,
           executable images of these alternative versions of the
           debugger are activated using system logical names. To
           install this Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX kit properly,
           you must remove the following logical names before
           installing the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger on this
           Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX kit. Use the DEASSIGN/SYSTEM or
           DEASSIGN/SYSTEM/EXEC command to remove them:

        1.3.2 Process Privileges

              To install Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX, you must be logged
              in to an account that has SETPRV or at least the following
              privileges:

              o  CMKRNL

              o  WORLD

              o  SYSPRV

              VMSINSTAL turns off BYPASS privileges at the start of the
              installation.

        1.3.3 Process Account Quotas

              VMSINSTAL requires that the installation account have
              minimum quotas as shown in Table 1-2.

           Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility to verify and change
           process quotas for the installation account in the user
           authorization file (UAF). (Some sites may restrict the
           use of the OpenVMS Authorize Utility to certain accounts
           or people.) For instance, to change the BYTLM quota for
           the account-name installation account, you might enter the
           following command sequence:

           $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE
           UAF> MODIFY account-name /BYTLM = 99000
           UAF> SHOW account-name
           UAF> EXIT
           $ LOGOUT

           After the quotas for the installation account have been
           changed, log out of the installation account and log in
           again for the new quotas to take effect. You can then
           proceed with the installation.

           User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT.
           For more information on modifying account quotas, see the
           description of the Authorize Utility in the OpenVMS System
           Management Subkit.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Remember to use SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and AUTOGEN
                when changing these settings. For example, to
                set GBLSECTIONS to 10, use ADD_GBLSECTIONS=10 or
                MIN_GBLSECTIONS=currentvalue+10. Also remember
                to account for other usage of system parameters.
                Slightly overconfiguring OpenVMS operations or
                memory usage settings by 10% to 20%, or more is
                unlikely to incurr any performance penalty. For the
                specific overhead involved with increasing these
                settings, see the performance manual.

        1.3.5 Disk Space

              Requirements for free disk storage space are different

     1.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

     1.3.6 Backing Up Your System Disk

           At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if
           you have backed up your system disk. Compaq recommends
           that you back up your system disk before installing any
           software.

           Use the backup procedures that are established at your
           site. For details on performing a system disk backup, see
           the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS System
           Management Subkit.

     1.3.7 Additional System Maintenance Procedures

           This section explains how to use the System Generation
           Utility (SYSGEN) and the AUTOGEN Utility to prepare your
           system for an installation of Compaq C++. AUTOGEN uses
           system configuration data to automatically set system
           parameters.

     1.3.7.1 Checking System Parameter Values

           To check the values of your system parameters, enter the
           following command:

           $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
           SYSGEN>

           At the SYSGEN> prompt, enter the SHOW command to display
           the value of a system parameter. The following example
           displays the value for the WSMAX system parameter:

           SYSGEN> SHOW WSMAX

           After checking the parameters with the SHOW command, enter
           the EXIT command at the SYSGEN> prompt to return to DCL
           level. For information on setting dynamic system parameter
           values, see Section 1.3.7.4.

     1.3.7.2 Calculating the Values for Global Pages and Global
             Sections

           To install and run Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX, you must
           have sufficient free global pages, global sections, and
           contiguous global pages. You must first find out how many
           free global pages and sections you have on your system.
           Then use AUTOGEN if you need to increase the global pages
           and global sections system parameters.

                                 1.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

              Enter the following DCL command to determine the number of
              global pages required by SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE:

              $ DIR/SIZE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE

              This command returns the size (in blocks) of SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE.
              As an approximation, use this figure as the number of
              global pages for the file.

              Table 1-6 lists the requirements for the number of
              contiguous global pages needed during installation. Note
              that the values represent the number of pages required for
              installation, not the number you need to run your system
              and other software.

              Table_1-6_Contiguous_GBLPAGE_Count_Requirements___________

                                       Minimum
              Product_Installation_____Value________Default_Value_______

              Debugger

              Compaq_C++_Version_5.6C__900__________95__________________

              You can use the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical
              function to find the number of contiguous global pages
              and free global sections. The following example shows how
              to get this information at your terminal (the default for
              SYS$OUTPUT):

              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("CONTIG_GBLPAGES")
              15848
              $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")
              24

              If the values displayed by the system are greater than
              the values in Tables 1-3, 1-4, and 1-6, you do not need
              to increase the values for these parameters. If the value
              of free global pages or global sections is less than the
              value in Table 1-3 or Table 1-4, you must increase the
              system parameter setting.

              Section 1.3.7.3 describes the procedures for increasing
              these values using AUTOGEN.

     1.3 Installation Procedure Requirements

     1.3.7.3 Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN

           Use the AUTOGEN command procedure to change system
           parameters. AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for
           parameters that are associated with the values you reset
           manually. To change system parameters with AUTOGEN, edit
           the following file:

           SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

           Use an editor to access the file. To change a parameter
           value listed in this file, delete the current value
           associated with that parameter and enter the new value.

           To add a new parameter, add a line to the file that
           includes both the name of the parameter and its value.
           For example:

           WSMAX = 8096

           To modify incremental parameters such as free global pages
           and global sections, use ADD_GBLPAGES or ADD_GBLSECTS.
           The following example increases the global page setting by
           2000:

           ADD_GBLPAGES = 2000

           When you set the page file quota, do not use a value that
           exceeds the amount of page file space available on the
           system.

           After you make all your changes, exit from the editor and
           execute the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
           parameters. The following command recalculates your system
           parameters and reboots the system:

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

           When you specify REBOOT, AUTOGEN performs an automatic
           system shutdown and then reboots the system. Any users
           logged on to the system are disconnected immediately
           during the shutdown. The automatic reboot puts the new
           parameter values into effect.

           AUTOGEN automatically adjusts some of the SYSGEN
           parameters based on the consumption of resources since the
           last reboot. If you do not want to take advantage of this
           automatic adjustment, include the /NOFEEDBACK qualifier on
           the AUTOGEN command line.

              For more information about using AUTOGEN, see the system
              management documentation for your operating system.

        1.3.7.4 Setting Dynamic System Parameter Values

              Use SYSGEN to set dynamic parameters. Dynamic parameters
              changed with the SYSGEN command WRITE ACTIVE become
              active immediately without any need to reboot your system.
              Rebooting returns dynamic system parameter values to their
              previous settings.

              After you change the dynamic parameter values, you should
              complete the installation before rebooting the system.
              After you finish the installation, you can reset the
              dynamic parameters to their previous values or let them be
              reset automatically when you reboot your system the next
              time.

              If the dynamic parameter values on your system are less
              than the values previously listed, use the following
              series of commands to change the values. This example
              changes the CLISYMTBL value to 500:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN> USE ACTIVE
              SYSGEN> SET CLISYMTBL 500
              SYSGEN> WRITE ACTIVE
              SYSGEN> EXIT

                                  Installing Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX



              After you register and load the License Product Authorization
              Key (License PAK), the installation takes approximately 5
              to 30 minutes depending on your system configuration and
              the kit components chosen.

        2.1 Installing the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger

              This section explains how to install the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger
              on systems running OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2. This
              procedure does not apply to systems already running
              OpenVMS VAX Version 6.0 or higher.

              The OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger has its own instal-
              lation kit stored on the same media as the Compaq C++
              installation kit and must be installed as a separate step
              before installing the compiler if the installing system is
              running a version of OpenVMS VAX lower than Version 6.0.
              If your installation medium is tape, install the OpenVMS
              Debugger before the Compaq C++ compiler to avoid errors
              when installing the compiler kit.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If you try to install the OpenVMS Version 6.0
                Debugger kit on a system running Version 6.0 or
                higher, the installation will fail.

                _____________________________________________________

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Defaults appear in
              brackets ([])  throughout the installation procedure.

     2.1 Installing the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger

           To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
           Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
           deletes all files it has created up to that point and
           then returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
           installation after pressing Ctrl/Y, you must proceed from
           step 2.

           1. Log in to a privileged account and set your default
              device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

              Username: SYSTEM
              Password:
              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE

           2. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

              This example invokes VMSINSTAL to install the OpenVMS
              Version 6.0 Debugger using the N option and shows the
              system response.

              $ @VMSINSTAL DBG060 MUA0: OPTIONS N

                         2.1 Installing the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger

                 This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in
                 step 2.

                 Release Notes Options:

                     1. Display release notes
                     2. Print release notes
                     3. Both 1 and 2
                     4. Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
                     5. Do not display, print, or copy release notes

                 * Select option [2]:

                 If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
                 notes on line immediately. To terminate the display at
                 any time, press Ctrl/C.

                 If you select option 2 (the default), VMSINSTAL prompts
                 you for a queue name. You can then type a queue name
                 or press Return, which sends the file to the default
                 output print device.

                 * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: CLUSTER_PRINT

                 If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays on line the
                 release notes immediately. To terminate the display
                 at any time, press Ctrl/C. VMSINSTAL prompts you
                 for a queue name for printing the release notes.
                 Either type a queue name or press Return to send the
                 file to the default output print device. The OpenVMS
                 Version 6.0 Debugger release notes are then copied to
                 SYS$HELP:DBG060.RELEASE_NOTES.

                 If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL copies the release
                 notes to SYS$HELP immediately.

                 If you select option 5, VMSINSTAL does not display,
                 print, or copy the release notes, but moves them to
                 SYS$HELP. Typically, you select this option when you
                 want to end the installation.

                 Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

                 * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES
                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, The product release notes have been
                     successfully moved to SYS$HELP.

     Installing Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX
     2.1 Installing the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger

              If you want to continue the installation, type YES
              and press Return. If you type NO or press Return,
              VMSINSTAL discontinues the installation. In either
              case, VMSINSTAL moves the release notes to SYS$HELP.

           5. Select the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
              options.

              You are asked two questions about running the IVP. The
              first allows you to run the IVP for the character-cell
              debugger. The second allows you to run the DECwindows
              Motif IVP.

              * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?
              * Do you want to run the interactive DECwindows Motif IVP [NO]?

              The purpose of the IVP is to verify that the installa-
              tion was successful. If the IVP determines that you
              have insufficient quotas to run the IVP, you are
              notified about which quotas need to be increased.
              The procedure then asks if you want to complete the
              installation without running the IVP. Press Return to
              run the IVP after the installation. If you do not want
              to run the IVP, type NO and press Return.

              The DECwindows Motif IVP defaults to NO. If you want to
              run this IVP, type YES and press Return.

           6. Select installation options.

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

              The directories SYS$HELP, SYS$LIBRARY, SYS$MESSAGE,
              SYS$STARTUP, and SYS$SYSTEM contain older versions
              of OpenVMS Debugger files. Some of these files are
              replaced during the installation with new files, and
              the following files are deleted because they would
              prevent the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger from working:

                 SYS$HELP:DBG$DSHELP.HLB
                 SYS$HELP:DBG$DSUIHELP.HLB

              The old files are not automatically purged. Purging is
              recommended. To purge the old files, press Return at
              the prompt. If you want to keep the old files, type NO
              and press Return.

           7. Read the informational messages.

                         2.1 Installing the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger

                 The installation procedure displays a number of
                 informational messages that report on the progress
                 of the installation. There are no further questions. If
                 the installation is succeeding, VMSINSTAL moves new or
                 modified files to their target directories.

                 A successful installation is indicated by the following
                 message:

        %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, files will now be moved to their target directories...

                 If you typed YES in response to the prompt that
                 requests a file purge at step 6, previous versions of
                 the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger files are now purged.

              8. Observe the IVP.

                 If you chose to run the IVP in step 5, VMSINSTAL calls
                 the IVP to verify that the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger
                 was installed successfully.

                 If you chose in step 5 to run the interactive
                 DECwindows Motif IVP by answering YES, the procedure
                 first checks to see that a suitable DISPLAY is defined
                 and available on which to bring up the windows. It then
                 displays the following message and instructions:

              The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
              media and the directory containing the Compaq C++
              for OpenVMS VAX save set. For example, DKA400: is
              the device name used in examples in this guide. The
              directory is [CXX05n], where n is the minor release
              number.

              To specify the device name on the @VMSINSTAL command
              line, enter:

              DKA400:[CXX05n]

              option-list
              The word OPTIONS followed by one or more of the
              following option designators-A, G, L, N, R:

                    Initially creates a file that contains your answers
                    to VMSINSTAL questions and prompts. You can then use
                    the option (and the answer file) to save time during
                    a reinstallation (typically after upgrading your
                    system).

                 o  Get save-set option (G)

                    Lets you store product save sets temporarily on a
                    magnetic tape or in a disk directory.

                 o  File log option (L)

                    Logs all activity to the terminal during installa-
                    tion.

                 o  Display or print the release notes (N)

                    Indicates that you want to see the installation
                    question on release notes. If you do not include
                    the N option, VMSINSTAL does not ask you about
                    the release notes. You should review the release
                    notes before proceeding with the installation in
                    case they contain additional information about the
                    installation.

                    If you are restarting the installation and have
                    already reviewed the release notes, you do not need
                    to specify the N option. (Even if you omit the N
                    option when you invoke VMSINSTAL, the DEC C++ for
                    OpenVMS VAX Release Notes are copied automatically
                    to the SYS$HELP directory.)

                 o  Alternative root option (R)

                    Lets you install the product to a system root other
                    than that of the running system.

                 For detailed information on these software installation
                 options, see the OpenVMS operating system documenta-
                 tion. If you specify more than one option, separate the
                 options with commas, such as OPTIONS A,N.

                 The following example invokes VMSINSTAL to install
                 Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX and shows the system
                 response. This example uses the OPTIONS N release note
                 option.

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL CXX05n DKA400:[CXX05n] OPTIONS N

                    OpenVMS VAX Software Product Installation Procedure V6.1

              It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              If you do not supply either the product name or the
              device name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information
              later in the installation procedure.

              When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

              o  Whether you are logged in to a privileged account.
                 Compaq recommends that you install software from the
                 system manager's account with your default device
                 and directory set to SYS$UPDATE.

              o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
                 VMSINSTAL checks for the quota values shown in
                 Table 1-2.

              VMSINSTAL then checks to determine whether any users
              are logged in to the system. If users are logged
              in, VMSINSTAL asks whether you want to continue the
              installation:

              * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]?  YES

              If you want to continue, enter YES. If you want to stop
              the installation, press Return.

           3. Confirm system backup.

              * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

              If you are satisfied with the backup of your system
              disk, press Return. Otherwise, enter NO to discontinue
              the installation. After you back up your system disk,
              you can restart the installation.

              If you omitted the device name on the VMSINSTAL command
              line, the following prompt appears:

              * Where will the distribution volumes be mounted: DKA400:[CXX05n]

                  2.2 Installing the Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX Compiler

                 If this prompt appears, enter the name of the
                 distribution (media) device and directory that contains
                 the Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX kit (save set). For
                 example, if the media is contained on a CD-ROM located
                 on unit DKA400:, enter DKA400:[CXX05n] in reply to this
                 question (where n is the minor version number).

                 If you entered the wrong device name when you invoked
                 VMSINSTAL and need to restart the installation, or
                 if you want to abort the installation for any other
                 reason, press Ctrl/Y.

              4. Verify the product being installed.

                  The following products will be processed:

                    CXX V5.n

                      Beginning installation of CXX V5.n at hh:mm

                    %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set A...

                 The product name and version are displayed. This save
                 set (A) is restored to a subdirectory of SYS$UPDATE:.

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have
                 been moved to SYS$HELP.

                 The release notes are copied to the following files in
                 the SYS$HELP directory (where n is the minor version
                 number):

                 SYS$HELP:CXX05n.RELEASE_NOTES
                 SYS$HELP:CXX05n_RELEASE_NOTES.PS

                 After the installation, you can enter the following
                 command to view the location of the release notes
                 through the Help facility:

                 $ HELP CXX RELEASE_NOTES

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                The name of the release notes file (installed by
                VMSINSTAL) consists of the current product name and
                version number.

           5. Purge files.

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? YES

              The directories SYS$HELP, SYS$LIBRARY, SYS$MESSAGE,
              SYS$SYSTEM, and SYS$TEST may contain previous versions
              of Compaq C++ files. These files are replaced during
              the installation with new files, but the old files are
              not automatically purged. Purging is recommended. In
              response to the purging prompt, press Return or enter
              YES and press Return to purge the files. To keep the
              files, enter NO and press Return.

           6. Respond to license registration queries.

              The Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX compiler component
              supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF).
              If you entered YES to install the compiler component,
              the installation procedure displays license information
              about Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX. It asks whether you
              have registered and loaded your PAK for each product.
              The following is an example of the information and the
              queries presented by the installation procedure:

                  Compaq C++ requires a Product Authorization Key (PAK) be registered and
                  loaded.  Answer the following question with YES if at least one PAK with
                  the specified product name and a date equal to or later than the date
                  shown is registered and loaded, otherwise answer NO.

                    Product:      CXX-V, CXX-V-USER, CXX-V-G
                    Producer:     DEC
                    Version:      5.n
                    Release Date: dd-mmm-yyyy

              * Does this product have an authorization key registered and
              loaded?: YES

              If you have not registered and loaded your PAK, you
              must answer NO to this question. You have to register
              and load your PAKs to successfully complete the
              installation (see Section 1.1). If you have not done
              so, you should stop the installation, register and load
              your PAKs, and then restart the installation.

           7. Choose the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
              option.

                  2.2 Installing the Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX Compiler

                 If you have chosen to install the compiler component,
                 the installation procedure now asks if you want to run
                 the IVP.

                     This kit contains an Installation Verification Procedure
                     (IVP) to  verify the correct  installation of the Compaq C++
                     compiler.  The IVP will be placed in:

                                SYS$TEST:CXX$IVP.COM

                     After the installation is complete, you can invoke the
                     command file at any time to reverify that Compaq C++ is
                     installed and working correctly.

                 * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

                 After the Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX compiler is
                 installed, you can run the IVP independently to verify
                 that the software is available on your system. You
                 might need to run the IVP after a system failure to
                 make sure that the users can access the Compaq C++ for
                 OpenVMS VAX compiler.

              8. Read informational messages.

                 The installation procedure now displays a number of
                 informational messages that report on the progress of
                 the installation. There are no further questions. If
                 the installation procedure has been successful up to
                 this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new or modified files
                 to their target directories, updates help files, and
                 updates DCL tables, if necessary. The new files include
                 the following:

                                  Installing Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX
                  2.2 Installing the Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX Compiler

                 Depending on whether you specified parameters on the
                 VMSINSTAL command line, the * Products: prompt or the
                 DCL prompt ($) may appear. If the * Products: prompt
                 appears, you can return to the DCL prompt by pressing
                 Ctrl/Z.

                 If you removed any media from the console drive before
                 beginning the installation, you should replace it now.

                 VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process
                 symbol tables during the installation. Therefore,
                 if you are going to continue using the installation
                 account (such as SYSTEM) and you want to restore these
                 symbols, you should log out and log in again.

        2.3 Error Recovery

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks if you want to continue the
              installation. In some instances, you can enter YES to
              continue. To stop the installation process and correct the
              situation, enter NO or press Return. Correct the problem
              and restart the installation.

              If errors occur during the installation itself or when
              the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is running,
              VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
              fails, the installation procedure the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX
              Version 5.n has failed.

              If the IVP fails, it displays these messages:

                                                      After Installation



              Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX is now installed and can be
              invoked by all users with the cxx command.

              The installation procedure modifies the DCL command table
              so that the cxx command is recognized and processed.
              However, the previous command table is still in effect
              for those users who are currently logged in. All logged-in
              users who want to use the cxx command must log out and log
              in again, or use the following DCL command:

              $ SET COMMAND /TABLES=SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES

              The following tasks can be performed after Compaq C++ for
              OpenVMS VAX is installed:

              o  Running the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
                 separately

              o  Editing the system startup and shutdown files

              o  Modifying system parameter settings

              o  Making the product usable on a VMScluster

              o  Setting user account quotas

              o  Reporting problems

              The following sections describe these tasks in detail.

        3.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedures Separately

              You usually run the Installation Verification Procedures
              (IVPs) during installation. If you want to run the IVPs
              separately to ensure the integrity of installed files
              should system problems occur, use the following IVP
              command procedures:

                                                  After Installation 3-1

 



     After Installation
     3.1 Running the Installation Verification Procedures Separately

           $ @SYS$TEST:DBG$IVP.COM
           $ @SYS$TEST:DBG$DW$IVP.COM
           $ @SYS$TEST:CXX$IVP.COM

           If an IVP fails for any reason, the following message is
           displayed:

           Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX VERSION V5.n TEST FAILED

     3.2 Editing and Organizing System Files

           To provide for automatic startup of Compaq C++ when your
           system is rebooted, add the command line that starts
           Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX to the system startup file,
           SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM. Compaq C++ for OpenVMS
           VAX cannot start until after the network has started.
           You must position this new command line after the line
           that invokes the network startup command procedure. The
           following example shows the network startup command line
           followed by the Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX startup command
           line:

           $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
                .
                .
                .
           $ @SYS$STARTUP:CCXX$STARTUP.COM

           You must invoke this command procedure to define the
           logical names that the compiler needs to find the Compaq
           C++ Class Library header source files.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              SYS$STARTUP:CCXX$STARTUP.COM starts the Compaq
              C++ for OpenVMS VAX compiler only. To activate
              the OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger you must exe-
              cute SYS$STARTUP:DEBUG$STARTUP.COM. To invoke
              the Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components, execute
              SYS$STARTUP:CRT$STARTUP.COM.

              _____________________________________________________

                                                      After Installation
                                 3.2 Editing and Organizing System Files

              If you have a system logical name or one or more options
              files that point to the old linker and the old run-time
              libraries (RTLs) that resided in dev:[CXX$LIBRARY.SYSTEM]LINK.EXE
              and dev:[DECC$LIBRARY.CRTL]*.*, you should remove them.
              That linker is obsolete and the RTLs are made obsolete by
              the new Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components Version 6.0 for
              OpenVMS VAX kit (or by your OpenVMS VAX system Version 6.0
              or higher).

              To let system users use the newly installed OpenVMS
              Version 6.0 Debugger kit, deactivate alternative versions
              of the OpenVMS Debugger that might have been installed
              by layered product kits. Remove the startup file,
              SYS$STARTUP:DEBUG$STARTUP.COM from the system startup
              file, SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM. Also delete the
              following files to remove the obsolete DECset Debugger
              product from your system:

              SYS$HELP:DBG$DSHELP.HLB
              SYS$HELP:DBG$DSUIHELP.HLB
              DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS:DSDEBUG.DAT
              SYS$MESSAGE:DSDBGTBKMSG.EXE
              SYS$LIBRARY:DSDEBUG.EXE
              SYS$LIBRARY:DSDEBUGSHR.EXE
              SYS$LIBRARY:DSDEBUGUISHR.EXE
              SYS$LIBRARY:DSDEBUGUIL.UID
              SYS$STARTUP:DEBUG$STARTUP.COM
              SYS$STARTUP:DEBUGSETUP.COM

              The OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger .DAT file is VMSDEBUG.DAT.
              If your system has a customized DEBUG.DAT file used
              to configure the OpenVMS Debugger, copy DEBUG.DAT to
              SYS$LOGIN:VMSDEBUG.DAT so that the customizations are
              reflected upon starting up the Motif interface to the
              debugger.

        3.3 VMScluster Considerations

              After completing the initial installation, if you want to
              install Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX on multiple nodes in a
              cluster you must run INSTALL on each of the other nodes
              and enter the following commands:



                                                  After Installation 3-3

     3.3 VMScluster Considerations

           INSTALL>  REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE
           INSTALL>  REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DEBUG.EXE
           INSTALL>  REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DEBUGSHR.EXE
           INSTALL>  REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:TRACE.EXE
           INSTALL>  REPLACE SYS$MESSAGE:DBGTBKMSG.EXE

           Execute CCXX$STARTUP.COM on all single-architecture (VAX
           only) clusters, that have a Compaq C++ license. To invoke
           OpenVMS Version 6.0 Debugger, execute DEBUG$STARTUP.COM.
           To invoke the Compaq C/C++ Run-Time Components, execute
           SYS$STARTUP:CRT$STARTUP.COM.

           If you are using a dual-architecture (VAX and Alpha
           systems) heterogeneous cluster, before executing these
           commands, make sure the appropriate logical names have
           been set to define the scope of the SYSMAN DO commands.
           For more information, see the OpenVMS System Manager's
           Manual.

     3.4 User Account Requirements

           Many products cannot be used unless certain privilege and
           quota requirements are met by user accounts. The following
           sections describe the privilege and quota requirements
           needed to work with Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX.

     3.4.1 User Privileges

           To use Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX, each account must have
           at least the TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges. Use the OpenVMS
           Authorize Utility to determine whether users have the
           privileges they require.

     3.4.2 User Account Quotas

           To use Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX, a user account does not
           need to meet any special quota requirements. However, for
           users who will be compiling very large programs (many
           program units compiled together), consider adjusting
           the working set (WSDEF, WSQUOTA, WSEXTENT) and pagefile
           (PGFLQUOTA) account quotas to improve performance.

           See Section 1.3.3 for a description of how to verify and
           change account quotas.

                                                    Sample Installations



              This appendix contains sample installations for each of
              the components on the Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX kit.
              These are only samples. Sometimes the installation
              procedure is modified in maintenance updates of this
              product.

              Be sure to read the Read Before Installing or Using Compaq
              C++ Version 5.6C for OpenVMS VAX letter before you install
              this product. This letter notes any significant changes to
              the installation sample shown here. Such information also
              appears in the online release notes.

              The following samples were installed on an OpenVMS VAX
              system. Depending on which layered products you have
              on your system, you might see additional messages and
              questions when you perform your installation.

              These sample installations assume that DECnet has been
              shut down, that no users are logged in to your system, and
              that OPTIONS N is specified to print the release notes.
              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs at the
              end of the installation.

              Example A-1 shows a sample installation of the OpenVMS
              Version 6.0 Debugger on an OpenVMS VAX system.

                        Files and Logical Names Installed on Your System



              The Compaq C++ installation procedure installs a number
              of files on your system and defines some logical names.
              Section B.1 tells where you can find the list of installed
              files. Section B.2 lists the logical names that are added
              to the system logical name table.

        B.1 File Names

              The kit for the Compaq C++ compiler includes a list of
              all the files created on your system when this product is
              installed.

        B.2 Logical Names

              Some or all of the following logical names are entered
              into the system logical name table when you install
              Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX. These names are stored in
              the product's startup file. They are automatically entered
              into the system logical name table whenever the system
              reboots or whenever the software is invoked.

              installation or product use.

        C.1 Failures During Compaq C++ Installation

              If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the installation,
              it notifies you and asks if you want to continue the
              installation. In some instances, you can enter yes to
              continue. To stop the installation process and correct
              the situation, enter no or press Return, then correct the
              problem and restart the installation.

              If errors occur during the installation itself or when
              the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is running,
              VMSINSTAL displays failure messages. If the installation
              fails, it displays the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX
              Version 5.6 has failed.

              If the IVP fails, it displays these messages:

              The Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX Version 5.6 Installation Verification
              Procedure failed.

              %VMSINSTAL-E-IVPFAIL, The IVP for Compaq C++ for OpenVMS VAX
              Version 5.6 has failed.

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exist:

              o  The operating system version is incorrect.

              o  A prerequisite software version is incorrect.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

           o  The OpenVMS Help library is currently in use.

           o  The product license has not been registered and loaded.

           For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
           conditions, see the OpenVMS documentation on system
           messages, recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software
           installation. If you are notified that any of these
           conditions exist, you should take the appropriate action
           as described in the message.

     C.2 Problems During Compaq C++ Use

           If you encounter a problem while using Compaq C++, see the
           Release Notes. If the problem is unresolved, report it to
           Compaq. Depending on the type of support you have and the
           nature of the problem, take one of the following actions:

           o  If you have a Software Product Services Support
              Agreement, contact your Compaq Customer Support Center
              (CSC), either by telephone or using the electronic
              means provided with your support agreement (such
              as DSNlink). The CSC provides telephone support for
              high-level advisory and remedial assistance. When
              you initially contact the CSC, please indicate the
              following:

              -  The name (OpenVMS Alpha) and the version number of
                 the operating system you are using

              -  The product name (Compaq C++) and the version number
                 of Compaq C++ you are using

              -  The hardware system you are using, such as a model
                 number

              -  A very brief description of the problem (one
                 sentence if possible)

              -  How critical the problem is

                                      C.2 Problems During Compaq C++ Use

                 When you submit information electronically or are
                 speaking on the phone to the appropriate Compaq C++
                 support specialist, you can provide more detailed
                 information. The information should include the
                 specific commands used to compile and link the
                 program, the error messages displayed, and relevant
                 detailed information (possibly including source program
                 listings). Please attempt to narrow the cause of the
                 problem to a specific module or lines of code.

                 CSC personnel might ask for additional information,
                 such as listings of any command files, INCLUDE and
                 COPY files, relevant data files, and so forth. If
                 the program is longer than 50 lines, submit a copy
                 of it electronically or provide machine-readable media
                 (floppy diskette or magnetic tape).

              o  If you want to comment on the Compaq C++ documentation
                 or if you should find errors in this manual, please
                 send the manual title, order number, and your comments
