                                                                  Preface



              OpenVMS SNA is a Digital Equipment Corporation software
              product that allows an OpenVMS user to communicate with
              programs running on an IBM SNA networked system. These
              systems must be part of a network configuration designed
              according to IBM's Virtual Telecommunication Access Method
              (VTAM) and Advanced Communications Function for Network
              Control Program (ACF/NCP).

              This manual presents the information needed to install and
              configure OpenVMS SNA on OpenVMS VAX systems that use the
              OpenVMS V6.2 (or V7.1) operating system.


        Intended Audience

              This manual is intended for OpenVMS VAX system managers or
              users who are going to install and configure the OpenVMS
              VAX SNA software. You should be familiar with installation
              concepts, and you must have knowledge of IBM's ACF/NCP and
              VTAM or have access to someone with this knowledge.

              Keep this document with your distribution kit, or insert
              it into the binder that is provided with OpenVMS SNA
              Management. You will need to refer to it again if you
              receive any maintenance updates or need to reinstall
              OpenVMS SNA.

    Structure

          OpenVMS SNA Installation is divided into two chapters and
          one appendix.

          Chapter 1        Provides introductory information about
                           OpenVMS SNA, describes all required and
                           optional OpenVMS SNA components, describes
                           the IBM parameters with which you must be
                           familiar, and describes access names.

          Chapter 2        Describes the installation and
                           configuration process.

          Appendix A       Shows the files installed during
                           installation.

          Appendix B       Provides a sample installation procedure
                           and a sample configuration procedure.

                                  syntax is that for an SNA line
                                  identification. A line is identified
                                  in the following form:

                                     dev-c[-u]

                                  dev    A device name.

                                  c      A decimal number (0 or a
                                         positive integer) designating
                                         the device's hardware
                                         controller.

                                  u      A decimal number (0 or a
                                         positive integer) designating
                                         a unit on the device's hardware
                                         controller, if the controller
                                         supports more than one unit. The
                                         default is 0.

              lu-id               A string of characters whose exact
                                  syntax is that for logical unit (LU)
                                  identification. An LU is identified in
                                  the form SNA-nnn.mmm, where nnn is the
                                  number of the PU and mmm is the number
                                  of the LU.

              node-id             Either a node-name or a node-address.

              node-name           A string of up to 6 alphanumeric
                                  characters containing at least 1
                                  alphabetic character.

              pu-id               A string of characters whose exact
                                  syntax is that for physical unit (PU)
                                  identification. A PU is identified
                                  in the form SNA-nnn, where nnn is the
                                  number of the PU.

              When you issue NCL/NCP and SNANCP commands, many component
              names, parameters, and qualifiers require additional
              information. In most cases, the syntax of this additional
              information follows a standard set of rules. (Exceptions
              to these rules are noted where appropriate.) All numeric
              values are in decimal and have a range of 0 to 65,535

                                               Preparing for Installation


              The OpenVMS SNA software is a set of programs and routines
              that implements the IBM SNA network protocol for programs
              running on a DIGITAL OpenVMS VAX system under the OpenVMS
              operating system. DECnet SNA OpenVMS access routines,
              such as the DECnet SNA OpenVMS 3270 Terminal Emulator,
              use OpenVMS SNA to access applications and programs on the
              IBM system.

              This chapter describes the preparations you must make
              before you install and configure OpenVMS SNA.



        1.1 Checking the Distribution Kit

              The Software Bill of Materials (BOM) included with your
              distribution kit should specify the contents of the
              distribution kit. You should carefully compare the items
              you received with the items listed in the BOM. If any
              components are missing or damaged, contact your DIGITAL
              representative before continuing with the installation.

        1.2 SNA Concepts

              An IBM SNA network perceives all communications with
              OpenVMS SNA in terms of logical connections called
              sessions. An application running on an OpenVMS VAX system
              and an application running on an IBM host-linked together
              in a session-are identified as logical units (LUs). When
              a session is established, the IBM host designates one LU
              as the primary logical unit (PLU) and one as the secondary
              logical unit (SLU). The SLU resides on your OpenVMS VAX
              system; the PLU resides on the IBM host.



                                           Preparing for Installation 1-1

 







          Communication between an OpenVMS SNA SLU and an IBM PLU is
          accomplished by means of a software component in OpenVMS
          SNA known as a physical unit (PU).

    1.3 Preparing the IBM Environment

          IBM SNA software components must be configured before you
          can use the OpenVMS SNA communications software.

          The OpenVMS SNA Guide to IBM Parameters discusses the IBM
          parameters required for successful communication between
          the IBM system and your OpenVMS VAX system. Your IBM
          systems programmer should pay special attention to the
          following macros and operands:

          You should regard the DIGITAL documentation as an adjunct
          to the IBM documentation; the IBM documentation remains
          the authoritative source for IBM software concepts and
          procedures. In most cases, the IBM parameters you use with
          the OpenVMS SNA software are compatible with the DECnet SNA
          Gateway software.

    1.4 Installation Requirements

          The following sections discuss the various requirements for
          installing OpenVMS SNA.

    1.4.1 Disk Space

          Installing OpenVMS SNA requires a certain amount of free
          storage disk space during the installation. Once OpenVMS
          SNA is installed, less storage space is required. Table 1-1
          summarizes the storage requirements.

        1.4.2 Privileges

              To install OpenVMS SNA you must be logged in to an account
              that has SETPRV or at least the following privileges:

              o  ACNT

              o  CMKRNL

              o  DETACH

              o  EXQUOTA

              o  LOG_IO

              o  WORLD

        1.4.3 Dynamic Nonpaged Memory

              You must ensure that your system has enough dynamic
              nonpaged pool space allocated before installing and
              starting OpenVMS SNA. Table 1-2 provides an estimate of
              the amount of system nonpaged pool resources required.

          available)

          Each LU authorization      272 bytes
          record_____________________________________________________

          To see the current dynamic nonpaged pool resources, run the
          SYSGEN utility and use the SHOW NPAGEDYN command:

          $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
          SYSGEN> USE CURRENT
          SYSGEN> SHOW NPAGEDYN
          Parameter Name          Current   Default   Minimum   Maximum Unit  Dynamic
          --------------          -------   -------   -------   ------- ----  -------
          NPAGEDYN                2050000    300032     16384        -1 Bytes

    1.4.3.1 Changing the Value for Nonpaged Pool

          To install and run OpenVMS SNA you must increase the value
          of the NPAGEDYN system parameter. Using the guidelines
          specified in Table 1-2, calculate the value to increase
          NPAGEDYN. If you have installed a previous version of
          OpenVMS SNA on your system, you might use a value less
          than the calculated value.

          For example, a system with 64 active LUs, 16 "in session"
          LUs, and a receive buffer size of 521 bytes needs
          approximately 450 KB of nonpaged pool. This amount
          increases as you increase the number of access names and
          authorized users.

          To increase the NPAGEDYN system value, use the AUTOGEN
          command procedure. AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for
          parameters associated with the ones you reset manually. To
          change system parameters with AUTOGEN, edit the following
          file:

          SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

    1-6 Preparing for Installation

 







              For example, to change the setting for the NPAGEDYN system
              parameter, add this line to the file:

              ADD_NPAGEDYN = nnn

              where nnn is the amount you calculated.

              Now, run the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
              parameters. Enter the following command at the DCL prompt:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT

              AUTOGEN performs an automatic system shutdown and reboots
              when it has finished. Rebooting your system makes the
              new parameter values active. For more information
              about using AUTOGEN, see the instructions on modifying
              system parameters in the OpenVMS documentation on system
              management and operations.

        1.4.4 Process Account Quotas

              To install OpenVMS SNA, the account you use must have
              sufficient quotas. Table 1-3 summarizes the process quotas
              required to perform the installation.

              Table_1-3_Process_Account_Quotas_for_the_Installing_Account

              Account_Quota____Value_____________________________________

              ENQLM            30

              FILLM____________20________________________________________

              Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
              the current values of these quotas with the requirements
              for OpenVMS SNA. For example, the account used in the
              following example is the SYSTEM account:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <RETURN>
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE <RETURN>
              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <RETURN>

                                           Preparing for Installation 1-7

 







          To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
          Authorize Utility's MODIFY command. For more information,
          see the VMS Authorize Utility Manual.

    1.5 VMS License Management Facility

          Before installing OpenVMS SNA you must register your
          software license. The license registration information
          is contained in the Product Authorization Key (PAK) that
          is shipped with OpenVMS SNA. The PAK is a paper certificate
          that contains information about the license you need to run
          a particular piece of software.

          You should register your OpenVMS SNA license before you
          perform the installation, configuration, and startup.
          During the installation, you are asked if you have
          registered the OpenVMS SNA license and loaded the
          appropriate authorization key. If you have not registered
          and loaded the PAK information, you can complete the
          installation; however, you will not be able to start the
          product or run the Installation Verification Program (IVP).
          After you register the license and load an authorization
          key, you can start the product and run the IVP.

          Register the license information by using either the
          OpenVMS License command procedure (VMSLICENSE) or the
          LICENSE REGISTER command, as described in the VMS License
          Management Utility Manual. When registering the OpenVMS SNA
          PAK information, use the product name SNA-VMS.

    1.6 Hardware Requirements

          Your single OpenVMS VAX system is attached to the SNA
          network through a DIGITAL hardware communications device, a
          communications line, an IBM communications controller, and
          modems (if not directly attached to the IBM communications
          controller). The following sections discuss only the
          DIGITAL communications device and modem requirements.

        1.6.1 DIGITAL Communications Devices

              DIGITAL communications devices support half-duplex point-
              to-point, half-duplex multipoint, full-duplex point-to-
              point, and full-duplex multipoint SDLC communications.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The words multipoint and multidrop have the same
                meaning and are used interchangeably in this manual.

                ______________________________________________________

              Transmission characteristics (such as speed and mode of
              operation) can vary to satisfy different performance
              requirements. For a list of supported communications
              devices and characteristics, see the Software Product
              Description (SPD) for the current version of OpenVMS SNA.

        1.6.2 Modems

              If your OpenVMS VAX system is not directly attached to
              the IBM communications controller, the communications line
              between your OpenVMS VAX system and the IBM host system
              requires a pair of synchronous modems or a modem eliminator
              (hardware that performs the function of two modems if the
              communicating systems are in close proximity). Modems can
              be full-duplex or half-duplex. The type of modem or modem
              eliminator that you need for each OpenVMS SNA line depends
              on the data transfer rate. The modem you select should also
              have the following characteristics:

              o  RS-232-C or EIA-232 (CCITT V.24) interface-for DPV11
                 device

              o  EIA-232-D (CCITT V.24) interface-for DSH32 and DST32
                 devices

              o  EIA-232-D (CCITT V.24) or EIA-422 (CCITT V.36)interface-
                 for DSW41/42 device

              o  EIA-232-D (CCITT V.24) or CCITT V.35 interface-for all
                 other devices

              o  Synchronous communication

              o  Full-duplex or half-duplex

          o  Leased or dial-up lines

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             The EIA-232-D interface replaces the RS-232-
             C interface. If you are using RS-232-C modem
             eliminators, you need a special adapter. Refer to the
             OpenVMS SNA release notes for additional information.

             ______________________________________________________

          For a complete range of modem options or for help in
          selecting a modem, consult your DIGITAL network specialist.

    1.7 Software Requirements

          OpenVMS SNA product installation requires the following
          software components:

          o  OpenVMS operating system software

          o  OpenVMS SNA software distribution kit

          o  DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX 7.1 or DECnet/OSI for
             OpenVMS V6.2 (VAX Wide Area Network Device Drivers and
             VAX PSI are included)

          When OpenVMS SNA installation is complete, you can add one
          or more DECnet SNA OpenVMS access routines if they are not
          already installed.

    1.7.1 OpenVMS Software

          You must have the required version of the OpenVMS operating
          system software on your OpenVMS VAX system (see the title
          page for the correct version of OpenVMS). If you do not
          have the required version, you must install it before you
          install the OpenVMS SNA software. For information on how
          to install OpenVMS software, refer to the OpenVMS Install
          Utility Manual.

          OpenVMS SNA also requires the Network class in addition to
          the OpenVMS Required Saveset class.


    1-10 Preparing for Installation

 







              When you are installing OpenVMS SNA software on an OpenVMS
              system, you must enable OPCOM to receive information about
              circuit changes that occur during OpenVMS SNA startup.
              If OPCOM is not enabled, you will not receive information
              needed to resolve problems. See OpenVMS SNA Problem Solving
              for information about event messages logged by OPCOM.

              To enable OPCOM when using an OpenVMS system, either issue
              the command manually or edit the SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_
              VMS.COM file and remove the comment character (!) in front
              of the @SYS$SYSTEM:STARTUP OPCOM command. After you remove
              the comment character, restart the system or run the
              commands in SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM by issuing the
              following command:

              $ @SYS$SYSTEM:STARTUP OPCOM <RET>

        1.7.2 DECnet SNA OpenVMS Access Routines

              DECnet SNA OpenVMS access routines allow you to communicate
              with programs running on the IBM system. Each access
              routine is installed separately. This manual provides
              instructions for installing only the base OpenVMS SNA
              communications software. For a complete list of access
              routines and individual user guides containing product
              installation information, see the SPD for the current
              version of OpenVMS SNA and OpenVMS SNA Management.

        1.8 Considerations for OpenVMS VAX Systems

              A VAXcluster is a group of OpenVMS VAX systems that
              communicate over a high-speed communications connection.
              VAXcluster systems have all the functions of single-node
              OpenVMS VAX systems and have the ability to share CPU
              resources, queues, and disk storage.

              To install OpenVMS SNA software on a VAXcluster system, use
              the following guidelines:

              o  Install OpenVMS SNA once for the entire cluster.

              o  For SDLC circuits, install a hardware communications
                 device on each node that is to have the OpenVMS SNA
                 software configured and used.

                                          Preparing for Installation 1-11

 







             A hardware communications device can be used only by
             the node on which it is installed. That is, a DECnet
             SNA OpenVMS access routine on one node cannot use a
             communications hardware device installed on another
             node.

          o  For QLLC circuits, you do not have to install a hardware
             communications device on each node that is to have the
             OpenVMS SNA software configured and used. For example,
             if you use PSI Access, you connect to the PSI Connector
             node that has the appropriate communications device
             installed (see VAX PSI Installation Procedures for
             information).

          o  Configure the OpenVMS SNA software on each node that is
             to use the software. When configuring the OpenVMS SNA
             software, you must specify the name of the system on
             which to configure the OpenVMS SNA software.

    1.9 Configuration Requirements

          After OpenVMS SNA is installed, you configure the software
          by running the configuration procedure. Before configuring
          OpenVMS SNA, fill out the configuration questionnaires with
          the following information:

          o  Node name for VAXcluster system. Node names can have a
             maximum of 6 letters.

          o  Whether you are communicating with the IBM host through
             an X.25 network.

          o  Communications device information for the device you
             are using. This includes the line ID, how you want to
             load the communications device driver software, and
             the communications device hardware address(es). For
             additional information on the communications device
             at your site, refer to the OpenVMS VAX Site Management
             Guide or ask your field service representative.

          o  Line characteristics. For SDLC lines, defines the
             physical characteristics (such as line duplex and
             signalling) of the communications line connecting your
             OpenVMS VAX system to the IBM communications controller.
             The values for these parameters must match those used
             on the IBM system. Refer to the OpenVMS SNA Guide to IBM

    1-12 Preparing for Installation

 







                 Parameters or your IBM systems programmer for additional
                 information.

                 For X.25 lines, line definition is done using the VAX
                 PSI software product. The VAX PSI configuration must
                 be compatible with your network subscription and the
                 IBM NPSI configuration (see VAX PSI or DECnet-Plus
                 Management Guide).

              o  Circuit characteristics. For SDLC lines, defines the
                 characteristics of the SDLC circuit, such as tributary
                 address and XID number. The values for these parameters
                 must match those used on the IBM system. Refer to the
                 OpenVMS SNA Guide to IBM Parameters or your IBM systems
                 programmer for additional information.

                 For X.25 lines, defines the characteristics of the X.25
                 virtual circuit, such as local and remote DTE, network
                 name, type of calls and reverse charging. The values
                 for these parameters must match those defined in VAX PSI
                 and on the IBM system. Refer to the VAX PSI Management
                 Guide, OpenVMS SNA Guide to IBM Parameters and your IBM
                 systems programmer for additional information.

              o  PU characteristics. Defines the characteristics of the
                 OpenVMS SNA physical unit (PU), such as maximum session
                 number and maximum segment size. The values for these
                 parameters must match those used on the IBM system.
                 Refer to the OpenVMS SNA Guide to IBM Parameters or your
                 IBM systems programmer for additional information.

              o  Access names. Defines the session establishment
                 parameters, such as IBM application name, LU used for
                 sessions, logon mode table name, and user data. Refer
                 to the OpenVMS SNA Guide to IBM Parameters or your IBM
                 systems programmer for additional information.

    1.9.2 Configuration Parameters for SDLC Lines

          VAXcluster node name
          If you are installing and configuring OpenVMS SNA on a
          system on a VAXcluster, write the node name of the system.

          X.25 network
          Write NO because you are using SDLC lines to communicate
          with the IBM host.


























    1-18 Preparing for Installation

 







              LU addresses available
              Write the highest LU address that the IBM host can activate
              for the PU. The maximum session number is a decimal number
              in the range of 1 to 255. It must correspond to the LU
              address as defined in the IBM LU macro LOCADDR operand,
              following the PU that describes OpenVMS SNA. It does not
              refer to the maximum number of LU sessions that can run
              concurrently. Set the number only as high as you need. The
              higher the number you specify, the more OpenVMS VAX system
              resources you will use.

              PU segment size
              Write the maximum size of the SDLC frames, in bytes,
              that are sent between your OpenVMS VAX system and the IBM
              communications controller. This value must be greater than
              or equal to the IBM ACF/NCP PU macro MAXDATA parameter. The
              larger the size, the more system memory will be used.

              Circuit duplex
              Write FULL if the circuit will send and receive SDLC frames
              simultaneously.

              Write HALF if the circuit will send frames after the IBM
              host finishes sending the frames.

              The value you specify must correspond to the IBM ACF/NCP PU
              macro DATMODE parameter.

              Station address
              Write the SDLC station address for the PU. The station
              address value is a 2-digit hexadecimal number. It must
              correspond to the SDLC station address as defined in the
              IBM ACF/NCP PU macro ADDR parameter for leased lines, or in
              VTAM for dial-up lines). If you do not know what value to
              use, consult your IBM systems programmer.

              Exchange ID
              If you have a dial-up line, write the SDLC exchange ID
              (XID) associated with the circuit. The XID is exchanged
              between OpenVMS SNA and the IBM host before the PU is
              activated.

              This value is an 8-digit hexadecimal number and corresponds
              to the value of the IDBLK and IDNUM parameters on the IBM
              VTAM PU macro together, in that order.

          Line ID
          Write the line ID for the communications device using the
          following format:

          dev[-c[-u]]

          dev
          Represents the device name (DPV, DMB, DSB, DSH, DST, DSF,
          DSW, or DSV).

          c
          Represents the device's hardware controller number. The
          numbers 0, 1, and 2 correspond to OpenVMS controllers A, B,
          and C, respectively.

          u
          Represents the device unit number.

          The controller number and unit number are optional; they
          default to 0. Table 1-6 contains valid line IDs for the
          DIGITAL communication devices.

              Line duplex
              Write HALF if your line modem hardware and related line are
              configured for half-duplex. Half-duplex is typically found
              with dial-up lines.

              two-way, simultaneous connections using full-duplex modem
              hardware.

              Table 1-6 contains valid DUPLEX parameter values for the

              NRZI signalling
              Write YES if the SDLC communications line will operate
              in NRZI (non-return-to-zero-inverted) mode. That is, the
              signals are interpreted as NRZI. If the line will operate
              in NRZI mode, the modems must also support NRZI operation.

              Write NO if the SDLC communications line will operate in
              normal (NRZ) mode.

          The value you specify must correspond with the IBM ACF/NCP
          LINE macro, NRZI operand.

          Table 1-6 contains valid SIGNALLING parameter values for
          the DIGITAL communications.

          Multidropped line
          Write YES if your OpenVMS SNA system is a multidrop
          configuration (multiple SDLC stations on a physical line).

          Write NO if your OpenVMS SNA system is the only device on
          the line.

          Loading the device driver
          There are three ways to configure a device using SYSGEN:

          1. Autoconfigure the device at system startup. This is a
             valid method for all communications devices except the
             DPV11 communications device.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             To autoconfigure the DMB32 synchronous port and the
             DSB32, DSH32, DST32, and DSV11, the 50-pin external
             interface adapter cable (BC19) must be in place.

             ______________________________________________________

          2. Load and configure the device at system startup. This
             method is valid for all devices.

          3. Load and connect the device at OpenVMS SNA startup. This
             method is valid for all devices.

          If you select method 1 or 2, write NO. When OpenVMS SNA
          starts, it assumes that the driver has already been loaded
          and does not attempt to load it.

          If you select method 3, write YES. OpenVMS SNA will
          load the communications device driver software when it
          starts. (The DPV11 driver is supplied with the OpenVMS SNA
          distribution kit.)

          Adapter number
          For VAXBI and Q-bus systems, if you decide to have OpenVMS
          SNA load the device driver at startup, write the adapter
          number (in decimal). The adapter number is the nexus number

    1-22 Preparing for Installation

 







              for the device as displayed using the SHOW/ADAPTER command
              of the SYSGEN utility.

              Control and status register (CSR) address
              If you decide to have OpenVMS SNA load the DPV11 or
              DSV11 device driver at startup, write the CSR address
              (in octal). The CSR address is the physical address for
              a communications device.

              Vector address
              If you decide to load the DPV11 or DSV11 device driver
              during OpenVMS SNA startup, write the vector address (in
              octal).

        1.9.3 Configuration Parameters for X.25 Lines

              VAXcluster node name
              If you are installing and configuring OpenVMS SNA on a
              system on a VAXcluster, write the node name of the system.

              X.25 network
              Write YES because you are using a packet switched data
              network (PSDN) to communicate with the IBM host.

              LU addresses available
              Write the highest LU address that the IBM host can activate
              for the PU (circuit). The maximum session number is a
              decimal number in the range of 1 to 255. It must correspond
              to the LU address as defined in the IBM LU macro LOCADDR
              operand, following the PU that describes OpenVMS SNA. It
              does not refer to the maximum number of LU sessions that
              can run concurrently. Set the number as high as you need
              but no higher. A higher number uses more OpenVMS VAX system
              resources.

              PU Segment size
              Write the maximum size of the SNA Path Information Units
              (PIU),in bytes, that are sent between your OpenVMS VAX
              system and the IBM communications controller. This value
              must be greater than or equal to the IBM VTAM PU macro
              MAXDATA parameter. The larger the size, the more system
              memory will be used.

          Calling direction
          Write INCOMING if the incoming X.25 virtual circuit will be
          used to establish a OpenVMS SNA QLLC circuit.

          Write OUTGOING if the outgoing X.25 virtual circuit will be
          used to establish a OpenVMS SNA QLLC circuit.

          X.25 network name
          If defining the virtual circuit for incoming or outgoing
          calls, write the name of the PSDN to which the local DTE
          is connected. The network name can consist of 1 to 16
          characters. The value you specify must match the parameter
          you defined when you used PSI$CONFIGURE.COM to generate the
          PSI NCL scripts.

          Local DTE address
          If defining the virtual circuit for incoming or outgoing
          calls, write the network address of the local DTE. The
          DTE address value can consist of 1 to 16 characters. The
          DTE uses this address to make outgoing calls or receive
          incoming calls. The value you specify must match the Called
          DTE value in the IBM VTAM PATH definition statement DIALNO
          operand.

          If you are using PSI Access, the local DTE address is the
          network address of the DTE used by the VAX PSI Multihost
          node or X25router node for connection to the PSDN.

          You must specify either the local DTE address or the group
          name; you can also specify both.

          Group name
          If defining the virtual circuit for incoming or outgoing
          calls, write the name of the closed user group (CUG) to
          which the local DTE belongs. The group name value can
          consist of 1 to 16 characters. The value you specify
          must match the group parameter you defined when you used
          PSI$CONFIGURE.COM to generate the PSI NCL scripts.

          For incoming circuits, the X.25 Incoming Call Packet
          must contain the CUG selection facility for OpenVMS SNA
          to activate the QLLC circuit. Some PSDNs remove the CUG
          selection facility from the Incoming Call Packet under
          certain conditions. Consult your PSDN authority for more
          information.

    1-24 Preparing for Installation

 







              You must specify either the local DTE address or the group
              name; you can also specify both.

              Remote DTE address
              If defining the virtual circuit for outgoing calls, write
              the network address of the remote DTE. The DTE address
              value can consist of 1 to 15 characters. The local DTE
              uses this value to make outgoing calls. The value you
              specify must match the Calling DTE value in the IBM VTAM
              PATH definition statement DIALNO operand.

              Exchange ID
              Write the QLLC exchange ID (XID) associated with the
              circuit. The XID is exchanged between OpenVMS SNA and the
              IBM host before the PU is activated.

              This value is an 8-digit hexadecimal number and corresponds
              to the value of the IDBLK and IDNUM parameters on the IBM
              VTAM PU macro together, in that order.

              Reverse charging
              If defining the virtual circuit for outgoing calls, write
              YES if the remote DTE will be charged for calls placed by
              the local DTE.

              Write NO if the local DTE is charged for all outgoing calls
              to the remote DTE.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                To control the acceptance or rejection of reverse
                charging for any incoming calls, use VAX PSI security.
                See the VAX PSI or DECnet-Plus Management Guide.

    1.9.4 Access Names

          An access name is an optional name you define in the
          configuration file. Access name represents the session
          parameters required for access to an IBM system resource.
          Similar in function to an OpenVMS logical name, an access
          name provides an easy way for DECnet SNA OpenVMS access
          routine users to establish an SNA session.

          When an access name is specified by a DECnet SNA OpenVMS
          access routine, the corresponding session parameters
          are used to establish an SNA session; the access routine
          user must remember only the access name. An access
          routine can also specify an access name and explicit
          session parameter(s). In this case, the specified session
          parameters override the parameter values defined for the
          access name.

          Access names are defined in the configuration file
          SNAVMS$CFG_node-name.COM or in any alternate configuration
          file that you create and specify at startup. When OpenVMS
          SNA is started, the access names and their parameters are
          read from the configuration file and added to the OpenVMS
          SNA database. An access name and parameters remain in the
          database until one of the following events occurs:

          o  You delete the access name by using the SNA Network
             Control Program (SNANCP) utility.

          o  You restart OpenVMS SNA. Restarting OpenVMS SNA modifies
             an access name if an existing access name and modified
             parameters are defined in the configuration file.

          o  You reboot the OpenVMS operating system. Rebooting
             OpenVMS deletes all access names. If the access name
             is defined in the configuration file, the name and
             parameters are added to the database.

    1.9.5 Access Name Parameters

          The configuration procedure asks you to supply information
          about access names. Table 1-7 is a blank access name
          questionnaire for you to copy and fill in. Record the
          access name parameters you will enter during the OpenVMS
          SNA configuration procedure as they are discussed in the
          following pages.

    1-26 Preparing for Installation

 







              If you do not enter an access name during the configuration
              procedure, you can add access names after configuration by
              editing the configuration file.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The configuration procedure always creates one access
                name, SNAVP. Do not delete this access name because it
                is used by the OpenVMS SNA Installation Verification
                Program.

              The following list describes the access name keyword
              parameters; ACCESS NAME is the only required parameter.


              ACCESS NAME
              The access name represents a list of session establishment
              parameters. The access name is a string of up to 16
              characters that can include alphanumeric characters and
              the following special characters: dollar sign ($) and
              underscore (_). Some DECnet SNA access routines limit you
              to a maximum of 8 characters in an access name.

              PU
              The PU name identifies the PU that is used when
              establishing a session. For OpenVMS SNA, the PU name is
              always SNA-0.

              LU LIST
              The LU parameters represent a list of possible LUs
              that can be assigned to a DECnet SNA access routine
              participating as a SLU in a session with an IBM host.
              When you establish a session, the first available session
              address is assigned. You can specify (in decimal) up to
              eight separate addresses, or ranges of addresses. Each
              address or range of addresses is separated from the next
              one by a comma (no space); for example; 9-10,1,11-24

              The list you define should correspond with the list
              defined for the IBM PLU on the physical unit with which
              you are communicating. The values you supply must also
              be consistent with the LU LIST parameter to the SET PU
              command in the configuration file. You can specify up to
              255 LUs for each access name. You can specify the same LU
              address under multiple access names. IBM addresses might
              be assigned to specific applications. Check with your IBM
              systems programmer for the correct ranges.

              APPLICATION
              The application name represents the VTAM application name
              of the program on the IBM system that you want to access.
              This name is identical to the PLU name on the IBM host. The
              application name is a string of up to 8 characters that can
              include alphanumeric characters and the following special
              characters: dollar sign ($), pound sign (#), and at sign

          (@). The first character in an application name should not
          be a numeral.











































    1-30 Preparing for Installation

 







              LOGON MODE
              The logon mode name represents the name of the entry in the
              logon mode table defined on the IBM host. The name is sent
              to the IBM host to obtain redefined characteristics for
              the session being established. The logon mode name has the
              same format as the application name. See the OpenVMS SNA
              Guide to IBM Parameters or your IBM systems programmer for
              further information.

              DATA
              The data represents user access control information that is
              sent to the IBM host for the session being established.
              Typically, the data parameter contains privileged
              information, usually a password. The information you
              enter depends on the IBM application with which you are
              communicating.

              The user data is a string of up to 32 characters that can
              include alphanumeric characters and the following special
              characters: dollar sign ($), pound sign (#), and at sign
              (@). If you need to specify characters other than those
              listed, you must enclose the characters in double quotation
              marks (for example, "&&").

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The use of the data field might compromise the
                security of your OpenVMS SNA-to-IBM connection. In
                the form of a password, user data provides access to a
                specified account.

                ______________________________________________________

              NOTE
              Specifies additional information (up to 30 characters)
              that is part of the SHOW SUMMARY display. You can use the
              note to provide information about the IBM application to
              which the access name refers. Specify the text of your note
              within double quotation marks.

              You should confer with an IBM systems programmer to
              determine what values you need to specify for most of
              the access name parameters. Some IBM applications do not
              require you to specify all the parameters To connect to the

                                   Installing and Configuring OpenVMS SNA


              This chapter explains how to install and configure
              your OpenVMS SNA software. You should not attempt the
              installation until you have installed the required hardware
              and software and prepared the IBM SNA environment. Complete
              the configuration questionnaire (see Section 1.9) before
              you attempt the configuration.

              OpenVMS SNA installation and configuration should take
              no longer than 20 minutes, depending on the type of
              installation media you use. The estimated installation
              time does not include preparation time or time consumed by
              problems resulting from failure to prepare properly.

              For general background information on installing optional
              software products on an OpenVMS VAX system, refer to the
              OpenVMS Install Utility Manual.

        2.1 Accessing the On-Line Release Notes

              The OpenVMS SNA software provides on-line release notes.
              The prompt to display, print, or copy the release notes
              before installation appears in step 4 of the installation
              procedure when you run VMSINSTAL with the OPTIONS N
              parameter.

              To obtain the release notes after installation, display
              or print the file SYS$HELP:SNAVMS$023.RELEASE_NOTES. On-
              line help also directs you to the release notes file. After
              installation, type the following:

              $ HELP SNA_VMS RELEASE_NOTES <RET>

    2.2 Using VMSINSTAL

          After you log in to a privileged account to install the
          OpenVMS SNA software, set the default to SYS$UPDATE; then
          run VMSINSTAL, the command procedure that installs this
          product. An example of this procedure is shown in steps 1
          and 2 (see Section 2.3).

          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <RET>
          $ @VMSINSTAL SNAVMS023 ddcu: [OPTIONS N] <RET>

          The command parameters are described in the next
          paragraphs. If you do not supply the first two parameters,
          VMSINSTAL prompts you for the product and device names. If
          you want to be prompted for the product name, device name,
          and installation options, type the following:

          $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL <RET>

          ddcu:
          Represents a device name where the distribution kit will
          be mounted for the OpenVMS SNA installation media, where
          dd is the device, c is the controller ID, and u is the unit
          number. It is not necessary to use the console drive to
          install OpenVMS SNA. If you do use the console drive, you
          should replace any media you removed from the drive. CSA1:
          is the device name used in examples in this document.

          OPTIONS N
          Is an optional parameter you should provide if you want
          to be prompted to display or print the release notes. If
          you do not include the OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL does
          not prompt you to display or print the release notes. Note
          that VMSINSTAL permits the use of several other options.
          For more information on the other options, refer to your
          processor-specific installation/operations guide.

          When you run VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:

          o  Whether you logged in to a privileged account. Digital
             Equipment Corporation recommends that you install
             software from the system manager's account [SYSTEM] with
             your default device and directory set to SYS$UPDATE.


    2-2 Installing and Configuring OpenVMS SNA

 







              o  Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
                 VMSINSTAL checks for the following quota values:

                 -  ASTLM = 24

                 -  BIOLM = 18

                 -  BYTLM = 18000

                 -  DIOLM = 18

                 -  ENQLM = 30

                 -  FILLM = 20

              o  Whether the following conditions exist:

                 -  DECnet is up and running.

                 -  Users are logged in to the system.

                 If VMSINSTAL detects either of these conditions, you
                 are asked whether you want to continue the installation.
                 To continue, type YES. To stop the installation, press
                 <RET>.

        2.3 Installing OpenVMS SNA Software

              This section contains excerpts from the installation
              procedure and explains each step. Default answers appear in
              brackets throughout the installation procedure. To accept a
              default answer, press <RET> in response to the question.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              <CTRL/Y>. The installation procedure deletes all files
              it has created up to that point and then returns to DCL
              level. To retry the installation procedure after pressing
              <CTRL/Y>, you must start at step 2.

              Step 1: Log in to a privileged account, and set your
              default device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

        <RET>

              Username: SYSTEM   <RET>
              Password: password <RET>
              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE <RET>

              Make sure you have backed up the system disk and that you
              have more than 8000 free blocks on the system disk.

          Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

          * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? <RET>

          Before you proceed with an installation that will write to
          your system disk, make sure you have a good backup copy.
          If you are satisfied with the backup of your system disk,
          press <RET>. If you do not have a good backup copy, type NO
          and press <RET> to end the installation.

          Step 3: Insert the first installation kit volume.

          Please mount the first volume of the set on CSA1:.
          * Are you ready? YES <RET>
          The following products will be processed:

          To continue the installation, mount volume 1, type YES, and
          then press <RET>.

          Step 4: Select a release notes option.

          This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in step
          2.

          Release Notes Options:

              1. Display release notes
              2. Print release notes
              3. Both 1 and 2
              4. Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
              5. Do not display, print, or copy release notes

          * Select option [2]: <RET>

    2-4 Installing and Configuring OpenVMS SNA

 







              If you select option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately. You can terminate the display at
              any time by pressing <CTRL/C>.

              If you select option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue
              name. Either type a queue name, or press <RET> to send the
              file to the default output print device.

              * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <RET>

              If you select option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release
              notes on line immediately and then prompts you for a queue
              name.

              For any of the first three options, VMSINSTAL also copies
              the release notes to SYS$HELP:SNAVMS$023.RELEASE_NOTES.

              If you select option 4, VMSINSTAL just copies the release
              notes to SYS$HELP:SNAVMS$023.RELEASE_NOTES.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                This version of the release notes file installed by
                VMSINSTAL is labeled with the current product name and
                version number. Take care not to delete release notes
                for previous versions of OpenVMS SNA.

                ______________________________________________________

              If you select option 5, VMSINSTAL does not display, print,
              or copy the release notes. The release notes remain on the
              installation media.

              Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

              * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: YES <RET>

              To continue the installation, type YES and press <RET>.
              If you type NO or press <RET>, VMSINSTAL ends the
              installation. In either case, if you selected one of the
              first four release notes options, VMSINSTAL moves the
              release notes to SYS$HELP.

          information is not registered and loaded, type NO and
          press <RET>. In either case, the installation procedure
          continues.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             Be sure to register and load the PAK information
             before starting OpenVMS SNA.

             ______________________________________________________

          Step 6: Select installation options.

          * Will this installation of OpenVMS SNA use the DPV11 device for SDLC
            communications [NO]? YES <RET>

          Type YES press <RET> if you are using a DPV communications
          device. Type NO and press <RET> if you are using one of the
          other communications devices.

          * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <RET>

          The directories SYS$COMMON:[SNAVMS$], SYS$HELP,
          SYS$LIBRARY, SYS$MESSAGE, SYS$SYSTEM, SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES,
          and
          SYS$COMMON:[SNACSV] could contain previous versions of
          OpenVMS SNA files. These files are replaced with new
          files during the installation, but the old files are not
          automatically purged. Purging is recommended. In response
          to the purging prompt, press <RET> to purge the files,
          or type NO to keep them. Either way, the installation
          continues.

              VMSINSTAL then displays the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset B...

              Step 7: Insert subsequent installation kit volumes.

              %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _CSA1: for reading

              Enter "YES" when ready: YES<RET>

              VMSINSTAL prompts you to insert the next volume and waits
              for you to type YES after inserting it. If you type
              NO, VMSINSTAL displays the prompt again. This prompt is
              displayed only if your installation kit contains more than
              one volume.

              Step 8: Read informational messages.

              %SNAVMS-I-NOMORQUES, there are no more questions
              %SNAVMS-I-PLEASE_
        WAIT, installation may take up to twenty minutes to complete

              Then, the OpenVMS SNA installation procedure produces
              a number of informational messages that report on the
              progress of the installation.

              The following message tells you that the installation was
              successful:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories...

              The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB file is updated to include the new
              versions of the SNAVMS HELP text.

              If the installation procedure is successful, the new or
              modified files are moved to their target directories.
              Appendix A lists the files and their location.

              If you typed YES in response to the prompt that requests a
              file purge (step 6), previous versions of the OpenVMS SNA
              files are now purged.

              Step 9: End the installation procedure.

                 Installation of SNAVMS completed at 10:54

          When the product installation procedure is complete,
          you can install more products, run the OpenVMS SNA
          configuration program, or log out (as shown here.) If
          you removed any media from the console drive before
          the installation, you should replace it now. Appendix B
          contains a sample installation procedure.

          VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process symbol
          tables during the installation. Therefore, if you are
          continuing to use the system manager's account and want
          to restore these symbols, log out and log in again.

    2.4 Configuring OpenVMS SNA Software

          After installation is complete, you then configure the
          OpenVMS SNA software. This section contains excerpts from
          the configuration procedure and explains each step. Default
          answers appear in brackets throughout the configuration
          procedure.

          To abort the configuration procedure at any time, press
          <CTRL/Z>. When you press <CTRL/Z>, the configuration
          procedure returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry
          the configuration procedure after pressing <CTRL/Z>, you
          must proceed from step 2.

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             If upgrading to a new version of OpenVMS SNA, you must
             run the configuration procedure.

             ______________________________________________________

          Step 1: Log in to a privileged account, and set your
          default device and directory to SYS$COMMON:[SNAVMS$].

    <RET>

          Username: SYSTEM  <RET>
          Password:         <RET>
          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$COMMON:[SNAVMS$] <RET>




    2-8 Installing and Configuring OpenVMS SNA

 







              Step 2: Run the configuration procedure.

              $ @SNAVMS$CONFIGURE <RET>

                  Command file to configure the OpenVMS SNA product
                  Executing on 25-OCT-1998 10:54:32.42.
                  Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.
                  Enter CONTROL-Z at any time to abort.

              Step 3: Select configuration options. (SDLC lines)

              The configuration procedure prompts you for site-specific
              information about the connection between your OpenVMS
              SNA node and the IBM SNA network. Use the information you
              entered on the configuration questionnaire (see Table 1-4)
              as the responses to the following prompts.

              Which VAXcluster member node will run OpenVMS SNA? [local system] :  <RET>

              If you are installing OpenVMS SNA software on a VAXcluster
              system, the configuration procedure requires you to
              identify the node in the VAXcluster on which the
              communications device is installed and on which OpenVMS
              SNA will run. Press <RET> if the local system node name
              (the system you are currently logged in to) is correct, or
              type the node name of the system you want.

              Will this node communicate over an X.25 network? [NO] :  <RET>

              Press <RET> because your node will not communicate with the
              IBM host over an X.25 network.

              How many LU addresses available to this PU?      [64] :  <RET>

              Press <RET> if the number of LU addresses is correct, or
              type the correct number of LU addresses.

              What is the PU segment size (decimal)?     [265] :  <RET>

              Press <RET> if the segment size from OpenVMS SNA to the IBM
              host is correct, or type the correct segment size.

              YES and pressed <RET> in response to the previous question
              (that is, when OpenVMS SNA starts, you want it to load the
              device driver software). Press <RET> if the default CSR and
              device vector addresses are correct, or type the correct
              ones for your system.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you decide to have OpenVMS SNA load the DSH32 or
                DST32 communications device driver at startup, you are
                not prompted to supply device information. The DSH32
                and DST32 parameters are constant and automatically
                included in the SNAVMS$LOAD_DEVICE_node-name.COM file.

              Step 4: Specify access name information.

              Next, the configuration procedure displays the following
              message:

              You may now enter any access names that you wish to create. Enter
              RETURN at the ACCESS NAME prompt when finished.

              Access name? (1-16 characters)                         [] :

          Next, the configuration procedure displays the following
          message:

          The configuration file SYS$COMMON:[SNAVMS$]SNAVMS$CFG_node-name.COM;1
          was created on 25-OCT-1998 11:01:41.25

          The configuration file was created.

          Step 5: Clean up old versions of the configuration file.

          During configuration, the files listed in Table 2-1 are
          placed on your system. You can find them in the indicated
          directory.

                                          specifications. This file
                                          is used by default when
                                          starting OpenVMS SNA.

          ________________________________startup.___________________

          The value node-name is the OpenVMS SNA node name you typed
          in response to the first configuration prompt. In a non-
          VAXcluster environment, the value of node-name can be 0.

          If the SYSGEN parameter SCSNODE is changed any time
          after initially configuring OpenVMS SNA (for example,
          a stand-alone node is now a VAXcluster node), rerun the
          SNAVMS$CONFIGURE.COM procedure and type the correct node
          name. Alternatively, you can rename the configuration
          command procedure, load device command procedure and
          authorization command procedure with the correct node name.
          For example, you might rename the file SNAVMS$CFG_0.COM
          file SNAVMS$CFG_MYNODE.COM. All three files must use the
          same value for node-name.

          This version of OpenVMS SNA uses the SYS$COMMON:[SNAVMS$]
          directory for most of the OpenVMS SNA files. The
          SYS$COMMON:[SNACSV] directory is not used. If you have
          any OpenVMS SNA files in the
          SYS$COMMON:[SNACSV] directory, you can delete them.

          Next, the configuration procedure displays the following
          prompt:

          Do you wish to start the OpenVMS SNA product now [YES]?:  <RET>

          Press <RET> to start OpenVMS SNA if you:

          o  are running the configuration procedure from the SYSTEM
             account or are an authorized user (see the chapter on
             OpenVMS SNA security in OpenVMS SNA Management)

          o  are satisfied with the responses you gave to the
             previous questions

          o  have started DECnet

          o  configured and started VAX PSI and the DTE state is

          After OpenVMS SNA is started up, the configuration
          procedure asks the following question:

          Do you wish to run the SNAVMS$IVP program now [YES]? <RET>

    2-16 Installing and Configuring OpenVMS SNA

 







              The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs tests;
              these check whether the installation and configuration
              procedures were successful and verify the connection
              between the OpenVMS SNA software and the IBM SNA network.
              Press <RET> to run the IVP. The IBM host must activate the
              OpenVMS SNA line, PU, and LUs before you can run the IVP.

              If you do not want to run the IVP, type NO.

              Step 7: Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

              If you chose to run the IVP in step 6, the configuration
              procedure now calls the IVP to verify the connection
              between the OpenVMS SNA software and the IBM SNA network.

              The SNAVMS$IVP program ran successfully and connected to VTAM. Checking
              of other DECnet/SNA access routine products should now proceed.

              If the IVP does not run successfully, see Section 2.5.5.

              Step 8: End the configuration procedure.

              You should add the following command to

    2.5 After Installation and Configuration

          OpenVMS SNA is now installed and configured and is
          available for use with the DECnet SNA access routines.

          After installation and configuration, you need to do the
          following tasks:

          o  Authorize users.

          o  Configure OpenVMS SNA for other nodes in the cluster.

          o  Update DCL tables for all nodes that have OpenVMS SNA
             configured.

          o  Start OpenVMS SNA, if not done during configuration or
             for other nodes in the cluster.

          o  Run the IVP, if not done during configuration or for
             other nodes in the cluster.

          o  Set user account quotas.

          You might also perform other tasks:

          o  Edit the system startup file.

          o  Edit the configuration file.

    2.5.1 Authorizing Users

          OpenVMS SNA uses privileged usernames to control access to
          certain functions. See the chapter on OpenVMS SNA security
          in OpenVMS SNA Management.

    2.5.2 Configuring OpenVMS SNA for Other Cluster Nodes

          If you are going to use OpenVMS SNA on other nodes in a
          cluster, each node must have the following:

          o  a hardware communications device

          o  OpenVMS SNA configured

          o  at least one DECnet/SNA OpenVMS access routine installed

          See Section 2.4 for instructions on configuring the OpenVMS
          SNA software.

        2.5.3 Updating DCL Tables

              After installing OpenVMS SNA on a VAXcluster system, update
              the DCL tables on each node in the cluster that will run
              OpenVMS SNA. Type the following command line:

              $  INSTALL REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES

        2.5.4 Starting OpenVMS SNA

              If you want to run the OpenVMS SNA start-up procedure
              separately, you must be:

              o  logged into the SYSTEM account or are an authorized user
                 (see the chapter on OpenVMS SNA security in OpenVMS SNA
                 Management)

              o  have started DECnet

              o  configured and started VAX PSI and the DTE state is
                 ON-RUNNING (for QLLC circuits only)

              Then type the following command line:

              $  @SYS$COMMON:[SNAVMS$]SNAVMS$STARTUP.COM file-spec <RET>

              file-spec
              Represents the name of the configuration file of your
              choice. The default file is SYS$COMMON:[SNAVMS$]SNAVMS$CFG_
              node-name.COM.

              If you try to start OpenVMS SNA on a node in a VAXcluster
              other than the node on which the OpenVMS SNA hardware
              device is installed, the following error message is
              displayed:

              OpenVMS SNA is not configured for this node.
              Execute SNAVMS$STARTUP from these nodes: node-list

              node-list
              Refers to the node(s) on which the OpenVMS SNA
              communications hardware device and OpenVMS SNA software
              are installed.

              If OpenVMS SNA has been started and you want to restart it,
              run the start-up procedure.

          If any error messages are displayed during startup, see
          OpenVMS SNA Problem Solving for a list of error messages
          and solutions. If you are unable to start the product,
          follow the troubleshooting steps in Chapter 2 of OpenVMS
          SNA Problem Solving.

    2.5.5 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

          The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is usually
          run at configuration. DIGITAL recommends, however, that
          you run the IVP after you make changes to the physical
          connection (for example, adding new modems) or after the
          IBM systems programmer makes changes to the host system
          software. The program verifies the connection between the
          OpenVMS SNA software and the IBM SNA network. To run the
          IVP, type the following command:

          $  @SYS$TEST:SNAVMS$IVP <RET>

          If you receive either of the following messages, the
          verification program has completed successfully:

          CONREQREJ   CONREQREJ is a normal completion code for
                      SNAVMS$IVP. It indicates that your line is
                      active and that SNAVMS$IVP has succeeded in
                      making a connection to VTAM.

                      The connect request is rejected because the
                      default $DIGITAL application is selected,
                      and no application named $DIGITAL is normally
                      available on the IBM host. The application name
                      $DIGITAL is the default application name used
                      by SNAVMS$IVP.

          NORMAL      The connection to VTAM was successful and the
                      application name used by the IVP was recognized
                      by VTAM.

          If the IVP is not successful, you must solve the problem
          before continuing with the installation. The following
          default values used by the IVP might be the source of your
          problem:

          ___________________________________________________________
          Parameter________Default_Value_____________________________

          SESSION          1

    2-20 Installing and Configuring OpenVMS SNA

 






              ___________________________________________________________
              Parameter________Default_Value_____________________________

              APPLICATION      $DIGITAL

              PU               SNA-0

              ACCESS_NAME______SNAVP_____________________________________

              For example, if you receive an error message stating that
              a session is not available (SESNOTAVA), you might override
              the default value of 1 for a session in the IVP. In this
              case, perform the following steps:

              1. Select a session number that you know has not been
                 assigned, and change the session default with a logical
                 name as follows:

                 $ DEFINE SNA$VP_SESSION n <RET>

              2. Run the IVP to see whether the session default change
                 solved your problem.

              You can also use logical names to change the default
              application name from $DIGITAL to another application name.
              To determine whether an application is available through
              VTAM, change the default name of $DIGITAL to the name of
              the application you want to check, as follows:

              $ DEFINE SNA$VP_APPLICATION newname <RET>

              Then run the IVP. If you receive a NORMAL message, you
              know that the application is available through VTAM. If you
              receive a CONREQREJ message, you know that the application
              is not available through VTAM.

              If you are still unable to run the IVP successfully, refer
              to OpenVMS SNA Problem Solving.

        2.5.6 User Account Quotas and Privileges

              To use OpenVMS SNA, each DECnet/SNA access routine user
              must have TMPMBX and NETMBX privileges and the following
              minimum requirements:

              o  AST limit (ASTLM): 12

              o  Buffered I/O quota limit (BIOLM): 12

              o  Buffered I/O byte count quota limit (BYTLM): 32,000

              o  Direct I/O quota limit (DIOLM): 6

                              Installing and Configuring OpenVMS SNA 2-21

 







          Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare
          the current values of these quotas with the requirements
          for OpenVMS SNA. For example, the account used in the
          following example is the SYSTEM account:

          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <RETURN>
          $ RUN AUTHORIZE <RETURN>
          UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <RETURN>

          To change the values of these quotas, use the OpenVMS
          Authorize Utility's MODIFY command. For more information,
          see the OpenVMS Authorize Utility Manual.

    2.5.7 Editing the System Startup File

          You must edit the system startup file to provide for
          automatic startup of OpenVMS SNA when your system is
          rebooted.

          Add the command line that starts OpenVMS SNA to the system
          startup file, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM. You must
          position this new command line after the line that invokes
          the network startup command procedure. The following
          example shows the network startup command line followed
          by the startup command line for OpenVMS SNA:

             ________________________ Note ________________________

             In the DECnet-Plus environment the network starts
             automatically before you execute the startup command.

             ______________________________________________________

          $ @SYS$MANAGER:STARTNET.COM
               .
               .
               .
          $ @SYS$COMMON:[SNAVMS$]SNAVMS$STARTUP.COM

    2.5.8 Editing the Configuration File

          You must edit the OpenVMS SNA configuration file to add
          information or to correct any errors that you discover
          during the configuration procedure. After you edit the
          configuration file, run the start-up procedure to start
          OpenVMS SNA. OpenVMS SNA Management describes the editing
          procedure, provides a sample configuration file, and
          discusses the reconfiguration and restart process.

              This appendix contains a sample OpenVMS SNA installation,
              a sample OpenVMS SNA configuration for SDLC lines, and a
              sample OpenVMS SNA configuration for X.25 lines. Sometimes
              the installation procedure and the configuration procedure
              are modified in maintenance updates of this product.
              Because this installation guide is not usually revised
              for maintenance updates, be sure to read the release notes
              before you install and configure this product. The release
              notes describe any significant changes in the installation
              and configuration that vary from these samples.

        WAIT, installation may take up to twenty minutes to complete


                To install OpenVMS SNA V2.3, the configuration files and procedures
                must be placed in a directory. Directory SYS$COMMON:[SNAVMS$] is used
                for this purpose.

        %VMSINSTAL-I-SYSDIR, This product creates system disk directory
        VMI$ROOT:[SNAVMS$].
        %VMSINSTAL-I-SYSDIR, This product creates system disk directory
        VMI$ROOT:[SYSTEST.SNAVMS$IVP].
        %SNAVMS-I-CLEANUP, deleting previous versions of OpenVMS SNA files
        %SNAVMS-I-INSTALL, adding new OpenVMS SNA files

            The OpenVMS SNA files have been copied to the system disk. If you have
            not installed the communication hardware for the connection to the IBM
            SNA network, please do so now. After the communication hardware has been
            installed, OpenVMS SNA V2.3 must be configured.

            You should execute the following command to configure OpenVMS SNA V2.3:

                 @SYS$COMMON:[SNAVMS$]SNAVMS$CONFIGURE

            This creates the OpenVMS SNA configuration files, completing the
            installation. You can start OpenVMS SNA and execute the
            Installation Verification Procedure (SNAVMS$IVP) at
            the end of the configuration procedure; the procedure will prompt
            you.

            For current information about OpenVMS SNA V2.3, type or print the file
            SNAVMS$023.RELEASE_
        NOTES, which is supplied by this installation.
