                                                             Introduction


              This chapter is an overview of BASEstar software
              installation procedures and installation options. It also
              describes installation preparation and preliminary steps,
              and provides an overview of VMScluster installation.

        1.1 Overview

              The BASEstar installation procedures allow you to customize
              each BASEstar system by installing only those system
              components that you want for the target system. You
              can install BASEstar software on a single node or on a
              VMScluster system, provided the cluster member nodes share
              the same system disk.

              The main BASEstar installation procedure is mandatory
              for all BASEstar systems and installs basic application
              integration features such as application synchronization
              and control and distributed name services. The main
              installation procedure has options, including the ability
              to install the BASEstar menu interface (OpenVMS VAX
              only), BASEstar data management capabilities, and BASEstar
              external data support.

              In addition to the main installation options, there are
              optional installation save sets available with BASEstar
              software that provide device connection management,
              BASEstar utilities, and DEC Rdb integration. See the
              following sections to learn about installation options
              in the main installation procedures and optional BASEstar
              kits that you can install.

              In addition to installing BASEstar software, you can
              install BASEstar Classic CIMfast software.

        Introduction
        1.1 Overview


              Whether you install BASEstar software on a new system or
              upgrade an existing BASEstar system to the latest software
              revision, the VMSINSTAL utility performs the software
              installation procedures. VMSINSTAL prompts you to choose
              installation options, set directory specifications, and
              choose the VMScluster configuration option. This chapter
              contains a checklist you can follow to ensure the correct
              BASEstar software is installed on each system.

        1.1.1 Main Installation Options

              Because the processing requirements for each node within
              your manufacturing system are unique, the first step
              in installing BASEstar software is to determine which
              BASEstar components should be installed on each system.
              Basic application integration software is installed on all
              systems. However, during the main BASEstar installation
              procedure, you are prompted to indicate which of the
              following additional BASEstar software components you want
              to install:

              o  Data management

              o  External data support

              o  Menu interface (OpenVMS VAX only)

              These components are optional in order to save disk space
              on systems not requiring these features. Consult the
              manufacturing system designer or user group to understand
              which, if any, of this optional software must be installed.

        1.1.2 Optional Installation Procedures

              In addition to the main installation, you can install
              any of five optional BASEstar components. This software
              is installed from separate kits to reduce the amount of
              system space required for the BASEstar installation if
              these capabilities are not needed. Optional installation
              procedures are included for the following BASEstar software
              components:

              o  Device connection management

              o  Utilities

              o  DEC Rdb database server

              o  BASEstar Classic CIMfast application enabler

        1.1.2.1 Device Connection Management

              BASEstar device connection management software is installed
              after the main BASEstar installation procedure is complete.
              To communicate with plant equipment, BASEstar device
              access software (DAS) must also be installed for the
              industrial control devices used at each BASEstar site.
              Consult the manufacturing system designer or user group to
              understand which, if any, of this additional software must
              be installed.

              The BASEstar device connection management installation
              procedure will conditionally install its menu interface
              component if the BASEstar menu system (OpenVMS VAX only)
              was installed during the main installation procedure.
              The device connection management installation procedure
              also includes installation of BASEstar device access
              software for RS-232 devices, DECnet and TCP/IP networks,
              and the DECdevice device communication module. Refer to
              the BASEstar Classic Device Access Software Guide for
              information on how to configure and use these DAS modules.

        1.1.2.2 Utilities

              The BASEstar utility kit offers seven BASEstar functions:

              o  The BCC$BASEGEN.COM utility for tuning BASEstar systems

                 Run this procedure on a loaded BASEstar system to
                 analyze its current OpenVMS resource utilization and
                 obtain suggested values for BASEstar parameters, system
                 parameters, and OpenVMS process quota settings.

              o  BASEstar text services for translating the BASEstar
                 message files

                 These services are designed to support international use
                 of BASEstar software by providing the text message files
                 needed when converting message text to a non-English
                 language.

              o  Software for reconciling OpenVMS version mismatches

                 The utility kit contains software for reconciling
                 OpenVMS versions if a version mismatch error occurs
                 during BASEstar installation.

              o  Logical point value change notification

        Introduction
        1.1 Overview


                 Provided with the BASEstar development kit is a tool
                 called the Value Notification Utility (Notify). You
                 supply the utility with a list of logical points. Every
                 time the value of one of the logical points changes,
                 you are notified. This utility requires a BASEstar
                 development license.

              o  BASEstar process data display

                 Use the Monitor BASEstar Utility to analyze the
                 processes running on a BASEstar system. Monitor BASEstar
                 continuously displays a default set of processes or
                 allows the display of a customized set of processes.

              o  Port activity display

                 The Monitor Port Utility provides a continuously updated
                 display of port data for all ports defined on the
                 system. Use the Monitor Port Utility to observe port
                 activity when tuning and troubleshooting.

              o  BASEstar LSE Environment

                 Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE) is a multiple-language
                 text editor that speeds writing and compiling source
                 code. BASEstar software provides an extension to the LSE
                 in the form of expandable tokens for BASEstar callable
                 services, DAS support routines, and BASEstar application
                 programming interface (API) constants. Before the
                 BASEstar LSE environment can be accessed, the LSE and
                 BASEstar Classic Development Kit must be installed with
                 the BASEstar LSE Environment selected. This utility
                 requires a BASEstar development license.

        1.1.2.3 DEC Rdb Database Server

              BASEstar software includes a DEC Rdb database server to
              export BASEstar data to a DEC Rdb database. Instructions

              a VMScluster for all nodes sharing a system disk. BASEstar
              software and device connection management software support
              VMScluster installation.

              The installation procedure automatically determines if the
              node that is executing the VMSINSTAL utility is part of a
              multinode VMScluster. If not, a single-node installation
              procedure will be performed. If the executing node is
              a member of a multinode VMScluster, the installation

              procedure will prompt you to specify the nodes to be
              processed and the BASEstar software configuration for each
              node. The executing node will automatically be the first
              node in the list of nodes to be processed.

        1.3.1 Disk Space Requirements

              The amount of disk space required depends on your BASEstar
              system configuration. The disk space requirements for the
              BASEstar software components follow:

                                                             Introduction
                                                1.4 Preinstallation Steps


                 DECnet software must be configured in order to install
                 BASEstar software. Refer to the BASEstar Classic
                 Configuration and Tuning Guide for instructions on the
                 minimum DECnet configuration required.

              3. Optionally, ensure that the following software is
                 installed: FMS for the menu interface, DECmessageQ for
                 messaging, and LSE for the Language Sensitive Editor
                 environment.

                 If you plan to use the BASEstar menu interface, ensure
                 that FMS Version 2.3 or higher is installed on each
                 system.

                 If you plan to use DECmessageQ with your BASEstar
                 system, install DECmessageQ Version 1.0 or higher. Refer
                 to the DECmessageQ Installation Guide for OpenVMS for
                 more information about installing DECmessageQ software.

                 If you plan to use DECmessageQ with BASEstar Classic
                 CIMfast, install DECmessageQ Version 2.0 or higher.
                 Refer to the DECmessageQ Installation Guide for OpenVMS
                 for more information about installing DECmessageQ
                 software.

                 If you plan to use the LSE environment for BASEstar,
                 install Language-Sensitive Editor software.

                 If you plan to use the CIMfast SQL component, install
                 Digital RDB Version 6.0 or Oracle 7.0.

              4. Install the BASEstar product license.

                 Before you install and run BASEstar Classic, Version
                 3.4 software on a newly licensed node or cluster, you
                 must first register a License Product Authorization
                 Key (License PAK) using the License Management Facility
                 (LMF). The License PAK may be shipped with the kit if
                 you ordered the license and media together; otherwise,
                 it is shipped separately to a location based on your
                 license order.

                 Before installing BASEstar, you must update the LMF
                 database using the License Management Utility. For more
                 information about the License Management Utility, refer
                 to the OpenVMS License Management Utility Manual.

        Introduction
        1.4 Preinstallation Steps


                 To update the LMF database, log in to a privileged
                 account and follow these steps:

                 a. Find the product name listed on the PAK that you
                    received.

                 b. To determine if a previous license is already
                    registered and loaded for BASEstar software, enter
                    the following command:

                    $ LICENSE LIST product_name/FULL

                    where product_name is the product name.

                 c. If a new PAK is required to be registered and loaded,
                    choose one of the following actions:

                    o  Execute the command procedure VMSLICENSE to
                       register and load the new PAK:

                       $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM

                       The VMSLICENSE procedure prompts for the
                       information contained in the PAK, and then
                       registers and loads the new PAK on your system.

                    o  At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER
                       command with the appropriate qualifiers that
                       correspond to License PAK information.

                 Table 1-1 shows the statuses of the licenses listed
                 during the main BASEstar installation.

                 When performing a BASEstar installation, you must
                 preload the licenses you want to use in order to
                 authorize the use of BASEstar on the target node. A
                 new license called BASESTAR-CU was added for BASEstar
                 Classic, Version 3.2. This allows you to license a
                 BASEstar system based on the maximum number of logical
                 points residing on the target system.

                 At installation, the BASESTAR-CU license is checked for
                 its presence and the installation procedure verifies
                 that the number of logical points is less than the
                 number licensed at startup. If the BASEstar parameter
                 BCC$MAX_POINTS exceeds the number of units specified in
                 the BASESTAR-CU license, the system cannot be started.

                 At BASEstar Classic CIMfast installation, the BASESTAR
                 license or the BASEstar Classic CIMfast license must be
                 present; either license is acceptable.

              5. Decide which BASEstar software components to install on
                 each system.

                 Review the installation checklist with software
                 developers and process engineers to create a list
                 indicating which BASEstar software components must be
                 installed on each system in your hardware configuration.

              6. Define your global name server configuration.

                 To make BASEstar objects accessible within a distributed
                 system, at least one BASEstar system must be defined
                 as a global name server. Other nodes are designated as
                 name dispatchers. Before installing BASEstar software,
                 determine your global name server configuration so you
                 can enter definitions properly during installation. For

                 Because these values represent minimum BASEstar run-
                 time system parameter settings, you may need to adjust
                 their values as required for systems larger than the
                 minimum BASEstar hardware configuration or for systems
                 running software in addition to BASEstar applications.
                 Use the following steps to adjust the system parameter
                 GBLPAGES:

                 a. Run the OpenVMS System Generation Utility (SYSGEN) to
                    view the current setting for the GBLPAGES parameter
                    on your system as follows:

                    $ MCR SYSGEN
                    SYSGEN>USE ACTIVE
                    SYSGEN>SHOW GBLPAGES
                    GBLPAGES 18000
                    SYSGEN>EXIT

                 b. Edit the MODPARAMS.DAT file to increase the global
                    pages available. If the GBLPAGES parameter is already
                    set, change the current value to the value you want.
                    If the parameter is not specified, you can add a line
                    to the MODPARAMS.DAT file to specify your minimum
                    amount as follows:

                                                        Introduction 1-17

        1.4 Preinstallation Steps


                    MIN_GBLPAGES=45000

                    In this way, more global pages can be dynamically
                    allocated if needed; however, your system will
                    maintain a minimum number of global pages equal to
                    the value you want.

                 c. Use the OpenVMS AUTOGEN command procedure to update
                    the new value as follows:

                    1. $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN  SAVPARAMS  GENPARAMS

                    2. $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN  SETPARAMS  REBOOT

              8. Stop interactive processes and disable logins.

                 Ensure that all BASEstar users have logged out and
                 no other users can log in to the system during the
                 installation. To disable users from logging in, enter
                 the following:

                 $ SET LOGINS/INTERACTIVE=0

                 Reenable logins after the installation is complete.
                 Refer to the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual for more
                 information on logins.

              9. Stop batch queues.

                 To stop the batch queues, enter the following:

                 $ STOP/QUEUE/NEXT  batch_queue_name

              10.Stop the BASEstar system.

                 If you are performing an upgrade of existing BASEstar
                 software, ensure that the current version of the system
                 is not running. Stopping the BASEstar system also stops
                 device connection management and all user-written
                 BASEstar applications. To stop the BASEstar system,
                 enter the following:

                 $ BSTAR STOP SYSTEM

              11.Check VMSINSTAL requirements.

                 VMSINSTAL requires that the system account used to
                 install BASEstar software have a minimum of the
                 following quotas:

                 For OpenVMS VAX systems:

                 o  ASTLM=24

                 o  BIOLM=18

                 o  BYTLM=18,000

                 o  DIOLM=18

                 o  ENQLM=30

                 o  FILLM=20

                 For OpenVMS Alpha systems:

                 o  ASTLM=100

                 o  BIOLM=50

                 o  BYTLM=32,000

                 o  DIOLM=50

                 o  ENQLM=100

                 o  FILLM=35

                 If VMSINSTAL detects any problems during the
                 installation, it notifies you and asks if you want to
                 continue the installation. In some instances, you can
                 enter Y to continue. To stop the installation process
                 and correct the situation, enter N or press Return.
                 Then, correct the problem and restart the installation.

              12.Back up the system disk.

                 Back up the system disk before installing the BASEstar
                 software. This backup is a protection in the event of
                 disk corruption or accidental changes or deletions
                 during installation. The procedure for backing up
                 the system disk is described in the OpenVMS System
                 Management Utilities Reference Manual.

              13.Verify logical names (upgrades only).

                 If you are upgrading your BASEstar system, ensure that
                 the logical names BCC$SYSTEM and BCC$SYSDATA are defined
                 by entering the following commands:

                 $ SHOW LOGICAL BCC$SYSTEM
                 $ SHOW LOGICAL BCC$SYSDATA

                 If the logical names are not already defined, define
                 them by executing the SYS$STARTUP:BCC$STARTUP.COM
                 procedure.

                                                        Introduction 1-19

 



        Introduction
        1.4 Preinstallation Steps


                 If you are upgrading BASEstar device connection
                 management, ensure that the logical name ILAN$SYSTEM
                 is defined in the system startup file by entering the
                 following command:

                 $ SHOW LOGICAL ILAN$SYSTEM

                 If the logical name is not already defined, define it
                 by executing the SYS$STARTUP:ILAN$STARTUP.COM command
                 procedure.

              14.Review release notes.

                 To read or print out the release notes included in
                 the BASEstar distribution kit, invoke VMSINSTAL in the
                 following manner:

                 @VMSINSTAL BCCXX034 mtcu: OPTIONS N

                 Release notes included with this kit are always
                 copied to SYS$HELP.

                 Additional Release Notes Options:

                 1.  Display release notes
                 2.  Print release notes
                 3.  Both 1 and 2
                 4.  None of the above

                 * Select option [2]:

                 Where XX = VV for OpenVMS VAX and XX = VA for OpenVMS
                 Alpha. Select an option when the installation procedure
                 prompts for release note options.

              15.Check required OpenVMS tailoring classes in the BASEstar
                 Classic System Software Addendum (SSA).

                 OpenVMS classes are mutually exclusive subsets of
                 OpenVMS files that provide a mechanism by which
                 customers can include only site-specific OpenVMS files
                 on their systems. This frees up space on the system
                 disk and results in performance and maintenance gains.
                 It also tailors the general all-purpose nature of the
                 OpenVMS operating system to specific customer needs.
                 Refer to the BASEstar Classic, Version 3.4 System
                 Support Addendum (SSA) for a list of the required
                 OpenVMS classes.

                    1.5 Upgrade Overview to a BASEstar Classic 3.4 system


        1.5 Upgrade Overview to a BASEstar Classic 3.4 system

              On an upgrade from BASEstar Classic V3.3 to V3.4, all data
              base files located in BCC$SYSDATA will be converted to
              the new V3.4 format during the installation IVP. This will
              require that all BASEstar logical point values, including
              points set up to be persistant, be set to their initial
              value on the next startup of the BASEstar system.

              The data base conversion execution will log its progress
              to sys$output during the IVP. Requirements for a successful
              conversion include the BCC$SYSDATA disk having 1.5 times
              the block usage in BCC$SYSDATA as free space, which is
              verified by the installation procedure. In addition,
              the user can request that log files be kept during the
              conversion, which would log each characteristic of a data
              base object both before and after it is converted. If log
              files are requested, it is reccommended that their location
              be a scratch disk (ie, NOT the system disk, and NOT the
              BCC$SYSDATA disk) with at least 100000 free blocks. IF
              the conversion process seems to hang, it may be due to
              this disk filling up, at which time the user will have
              to provide additional free space on the disk for the
              conversions to continue.

              Note that the time required for the conversions to complete
              is dependant on the size of the BASEstar object data base.
              This could take an hour or more with larger systems. This
              amount of time could cause a user to be concerned that the
              conversion is hung. If so, monitor the process performing
              the installation, as it should be consuming CPU time on a
              regular basis.

              Also note that all DCM data base files are also converted
              during the BASEstar IVP. This is because V3.3 of DCM will
              not run with V3.4 of BASEstar, and so a DCM upgrade is also
              required before restarting the BASEstar system.

              If for any reason the data base conversions fail, you can
              not start/use the BASEstar system until the problem is
              resolved. IF the cause of the problem is known (ie exiting
              via CTRL/Y for some reason, like the log file location disk
              is not large enough), you may rectify the problem, and re-
              run the conversions. Once the problem is fixed, execute the
              procedure SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEM.BCC]BCC$RESTORE_V33_DB.COM

                                                        Introduction 1-21

 



        Introduction
        1.5 Upgrade Overview to a BASEstar Classic 3.4 system


              This will replace all the BASEstar object data base
              files to their V3.3 state. You can then re-execute
              the conversions, by executing the IVP provided by the
              installation, and placed in SYS$TEST:BCC$IVP.

              If you are unable to determine the cause of the problem,
              you must collect the following information, and submit it
              via normal problem reporting channels:

              - a LOG of your installation, including the data base
              conversion failure.

              - a FULL directory of the system's BCC$SYSDATA ($ DIR/FULL
              BCC$SYSDATA:).

              - the LOG file of the object type being converted at the
              time of the failure.

              Log files created are as follows;

              (where BCC$LOG_DATA is the directory location the user
              provided for log file placement):

              BCC$LOGDATA:DB_DEVICE.LOG

              BCC$LOGDATA: DB_PHYPOINT.LOG

              BCC$LOGDATA: DB_POLLING.LOG

                                                             Installation


              This chapter describes the step-by-step installation of
              BASEstar Classic software. It also contains a list of error
              messages that may appear during installation and provides a
              description of recovery procedures for each error.

              BASEstar Classic software components are installed using a
              combination of four procedures:

              o  Main BASEstar (single node or VMScluster)

              o  Device connection management (single node or VMScluster)

              o  Utility (single node)

              o  BASEstar Classic CIMfast (single node or VMScluster)

              There is also an optional software kit that can be
              installed for DEC Rdb integration. For more information,
              refer to the BASEstar Classic DEC Rdb Database Server
              Guide.

              Read the instructions for installing BASEstar software.
              Follow the instructions for installing BASEstar device
              connection management, utility, and BASEstar Classic
              CIMfast software, all of which are optional installations.
              Refer to Appendix A and Appendix B for sample installation
              procedures. All installation procedures will perform both
              new and upgrade installations.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                Digital strongly recommends that you read the release
                notes before performing an installation.

              ____________and_group_file_for_your_BASEstar_system________

              During the installation procedure, you are prompted to
              respond to questions. Enter Y for yes or N for no, or
              just press Return to select the default response. You can
              enter a question mark and press Return after any prompt to
              receive online help.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              exits. You can then start the installation again.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                DECnet software must be running during the
                installation. Do not shut down the network for
                installation. Even if you do not have a DECnet license
                and your system is not networked, DECnet must be
                configured and running to install BASEstar software.

                 It is dd-mm-yyyy at hh:mm.
                 Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              3. If you have active processes, VMSINSTAL lists them and
                 asks if you want to continue.

                 %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
                  SYSTEM
                 * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]? YES

              4. Confirm system backup.

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? YES

                 If you have not backed up your system, enter N and refer
                 to the OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference
                 Manual. If you are satisfied with your backup, press
                 Return to continue.

              5. Mount the media.

                 You are prompted for the location of the distribution
                 media, the products you want to install, and options as
                 follows:

                 * Where will the distribution volumes be mounted: SYS$SYSDEVICE:[KIT]

                 Enter the products to be processed from the first distribution volume set.
                 * Products: BCCVV034

                 The procedure prompts you to ensure that you have
                 the correct BASEstar license installed on the system.
                 Enter the appropriate number if the license is already
                 installed. If not, abort the installation and install
                 the BASEstar license.

                 The procedure determines if the executing node is a
                 member of a multinode VMScluster. If the executing node
                 is a standalone node or clustered with only one active
                 member, the following message is displayed:

                 This node is not a member of a multi-node VMScluster.

                 A single-node installation will be performed.

                 If the executing node is a member of a multinode
                 cluster, you will be prompted to indicate if you want
                 a single-node installation:

                     This node is a member of a multi-node VMScluster.

                     A single-node installation or a multi-node installation
                     can be chosen.   For a multi-node installation, the nodes
                     must share a cluster common system disk, and so must all
                     be of the same architecture type (AXP or VAX).

                 * Do you want to install BASEstar on just one node [YES]? NO

                 If you answer N, the following text is displayed:

                     A VMScluster installation will be performed.   The current node,
                     ALIGTR, will be the first node in the installation.

              9. Enter additional nodes.

                 If you are performing a cluster installation, you will
                 be prompted to enter the additional nodes on which you
                 want to install BASEstar software:

                     You will now be prompted to enter the additional VMScluster nodes
                     on which BASEstar is to be installed.  End the list with a
                     carriage return .

                     (Enter Control-Y to abort the installation, if necessary.)

                 Current node name list is:  ALIGTR

                 * Enter node name #2   (CR to end list): SAXPHN

              10.Install additional components.

                 The procedure installs BASEstar software and asks if
                 you want to install additional capabilities. You can
                 optionally install data management software, external
                 data support, and the menu interface now, or in an
                 update installation. For example, if this is a new
                 installation, the following text is displayed:

                     This is a new BASEstar installation.  The BASEstar CORE must be
                     installed, but the Data Management and MENU System subsystems
                     are optional.

                 * Do you want to install BASEstar Data Management [YES]?
                 * Do you want to install BASEstar External Data Support [YES]?
                 * Do you want to install BASEstar List Services Support [YES]?
                 * Do you want to install BASEstar Menu System [YES]?

              11.Provide directory location.

                 VMSINSTAL asks for a directory location for the BASEstar
                 command and data files:

                     A location  must  be  chosen  for the BCC$SPECIFIC directory.
                     By default, BASEstar data and command files are installed in
                     SYS$SPECIFIC:[BCC$SPECIFIC].    This  specification  may  be
                     overridden if desired.

                 * Enter the BASEstar specific directory specification
                 [SYS$SPECIFIC:[BCC$SPECIFIC]]:

                                         2.1 Installing BASEstar Software


                 If you do not specify a directory name, the BASEstar
                 files are installed into the [BCC$SPECIFIC] directory
                 under the system-specific root directory. If you
                 enter a different directory, be sure it resides on
                 a permanently mounted disk. (Because these files are
                 data and command files, the system disk may not be
                 an appropriate location.) If you are installing on a
                 VMScluster node and do not use the system disk, specify
                 a different directory name for each node within the
                 VMScluster system. Verify the directory name specified:

                   The directory entered is:  SYS$SPECIFIC:[BCC$SPECIFIC]

                 * Is this correct? YES

              12.Choose a global name server or name dispatcher.

                 Specify whether the system is to be configured as a
                 global name server or name dispatcher. To perform global
                 name operations, at least one BASEstar system in the
                 BASEstar domain must be a global name server. VMSINSTAL
                 displays the following prompt:

                     Each BASEstar system must be configured to run either
                     a Global Name Server  or  a Name Dispatcher.

                 * Do you want this system to be configured as a Global Name Server [YES]?

                 If you enter Y, the system will be a global name server.
                 If you enter N, the system will be a name dispatcher.

              13.Select a target size for data files.

                     You must choose a target size for the following data files.

                     BCC$POINT_FILE

                 each additional node in the cluster.

              14.Choose a location for the BCC$COMMON directory.

                 By default, the BASEstar executable files are installed
                 in SYS$COMMON: [BCC$COMMON]. This specification may be
                 overridden.

                     A location  must  be  chosen  for the BCC$SPECIFIC directory.
                     By default, BASEstar data and command files are installed in
                     SYS$SPECIFIC:[BCC$SPECIFIC].    This  specification  may  be
                     overridden if desired.

                 * Enter the BASEstar specific directory specification
                     [SYS$SPECIFIC:[BCC$SPECIFIC]]:
                   The directory entered is:  SYS$SPECIFIC:[BCC$SPECIFIC]
                 * Is this correct? Y

                     You must now enter a list of the node names of all BASEstar
                     Global Name Server systems with which the newly-installed
                     BASEstar node (or nodes) will interact.  This list is
                     required for both new Global Name Server systems and for
                     new Name Dispatcher systems.

                     For your convenience, the list will start with the list of
                     nodes in this installation that you designated earlier to
                     be configured as Global Name Servers.

                 The value of the BASEstar parameter BCC$QUORUM is
                 established from the list of global name servers
                 entered. The following is displayed:

                 %BCCVV-I-QUORUMSET, Global Name Server quorum will be set to 1

                     If the above quorum value is not consistent with other Global Name
                     Server systems in the same BASEstar domain, the value of BCC$QUORUM
                     should be changed after the installation is finished and before
                     BASEstar is started on this node for the first time.

              16.Choose a target size for the global name file on the

        2.1 Installing BASEstar Software


                     IF this is a V3.3 to V3.4 UPGRADE, a data base conversion will execute
                     during the IVP.  This conversion requires user input regarding log
                     file locations.  The IVP will announce the beginning of the data base
                     conversions, before prompting for logging information.
                     The installation  time  will  vary  depending on the number of nodes
                     selected  for  installation  and  the type of processor on which
                     the installation is being done.
                     If the data base conversions are required, time will vary depending on
                     the size of your BASEstar Classic object data base.

                 Note: Please review introduction section, "Upgrade
                 Overview to a BASEstar Classic 3.4 System" for disk
                 space requirements needed for a conversion upgrade.

                 This installation creates a VMS rights identifier named BCC$USER,
                 which is used to control access to BASEstar.

                 After the installation is finished, the VMS Authorize Utility
                 must be used to grant this identifier to all accounts that will
                 use BASEstar.

                 Each VMS user account that will issue BSTAR commands must be
                 granted the BCC$USER rights identifier, as well as having
                 certain Authorized privileges set.

                 >> Remember to grant the BCC$USER identifier to the SYSTEM account

        2.2 Installing BASEstar Device Connection Management Software

              This section describes how to install BASEstar device
              connection management software. If your main BASEstar
              installation did not include installing the menu interface,
              the device connection management installation cannot
              install or update the device connection management menus.

              The BASEstar device connection management upgrade
              installation consists of the following steps:

              1. Log in to the OpenVMS user account named SYSTEM.

              2. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

                 The system displays the following:

                 It is dd-mm-yyyy at hh:mm.
                 Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              3. If you have active processes, VMSINSTAL lists them and
                 asks if you want to continue.

                 %VMSINSTAL-W-ACTIVE, The following processes are still active:
                  SYSTEM
                 * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]? YES

              4. Confirm system backup.

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                 If you have not backed up your system, enter N and refer
                 to the OpenVMS System Management Utilities Reference
                 Manual. If you are satisfied with your backup, press
                 Return to continue.

              5. Mount the media.

                     can be chosen.

                     For a multi-node installation, you will be prompted to
                     enter the node names to be processed.  The nodes must
                     share a cluster-common system disk.  Also, the current

                     ILAN$STARTUP.COM, a startup command procedure, is used
                     to set up the environment for Device Connect Management.
                     During the installation, this file will be placed in the
                     SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYS$STARTUP]  directory of the nodes on
                     which this installation is being performed.

                   SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM
                             (for VAX VMS versions prior to V6.0)

                     needs to be manually edited (after this installation has
                     successfully finished).   Locate the line

                                 $  @ SYS$STARTUP:BCC$STARTUP.COM

                     and add this new line immediately after the BCC$STARTUP
                     line:

                     The installation procedure has no further questions to ask
                     and can continue from this point without user assistance.
                     The time needed to finish the installation will vary
                     depending on the number of nodes selected for installation
                     and the type of processors and disks involved.

        2.3 Installing BASEstar Utilities Software

              This section describes how to install BASEstar utilities,
              including:

              o  The BCC$BASEGEN command procedure, which provides
                 suggested settings for BASEstar and system parameters
                 as well as OpenVMS process quotas. Refer to the BASEstar
                 Classic Configuration and Tuning Guide for information
                 on how to use this utility.

              o  Text message files if conversion to a non-English
                 language is necessary. These services can also be
                 used to copy the appropriate files into new BASEstar
                 directories.

              o  OpenVMS version number mismatch software, which
                 resolves, or relinks the BASEstar shareable image when
                 a new version of OpenVMS software is installed on a
                 system.

              o  Monitor Port Utility, which provides a continuously
                 updated display of port data for all ports defined on
                 the system.

              o  Monitor BASEstar Utility, which analyzes the processes
                 running on a BASEstar system. Monitor BASEstar
                 continuously displays a default set of processes or
                 allows the display of a customized set of processes.

              o  BASEstar LSE environment, which allows you to use
                 VAX LSE, a multiple-language text editor that speeds
                 the writing and compiling of source code. To use the
                 BASEstar LSE environment, you must first install VAX
                 Language-Sensitive Editor software.

              o  Value Notification Utility, which notifies you of
                 changes in the value of logical points that have been
                 supplied to the utility.

              The BASEstar utilities installation consists of the
              following steps:

              1. Log in to the OpenVMS user account named SYSTEM.

              2. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

                 $ @sys$update:vmsinstal

              To install BASEstar Classic CIMfast software, perform the
              following steps:

              1. Log in to the OpenVMS user account named SYSTEM.

              2. Invoke VMSINSTAL.

                 IVAX20 » @sys$update:vmsinstal BCFxxx022 DISK1:[CIMFAST.KITS]

                 where BCFxxx022 is the BASEstar Classic CIMfast product
                 name and version, (where xxx=VAX or xxx=AXP for Alpha)
                 DISK1:[CIMFAST.KITS] is the name of the directory
                 containing the software kit. If you include the optional
                 OPTIONS parameter, a question is displayed that asks
                 you if you want to see the release notes. If you do
                 not include the OPTIONS N parameter, the VMSINSTAL
                 command procedure does not ask you if you want to see
                 the release notes. Ensure that you read the release
                 notes before proceeding with the installation; they may
                 contain additional information about the installation.
                 If you are restarting the installation and have already
                 read the release notes, you do not need to specify
                 OPTIONS N.

                 When you invoke VMSINSTAL, there are several other
                 options you can choose, as follows:

                 o  Auto_answer option (A)

                    VMSINSTAL command procedure questions and prompts.
                    You can then use the option (and the answer file)
                    to save time during a reinstallation or a system
                    upgrade.

                 o  Get save set option (G)

                    Lets you store product save sets temporarily on a
                    magnetic tape or in a disk directory.

                 o  File log option (L)

                    Logs all activity to the terminal during the
                    installation.

                 o  Alternate root option (R)

                    Lets you install the product to a system root other
                    than the root of the system that is running.

                 See the OpenVMS documentation on software installation
                 in the OpenVMS System Management Subkit for more
                 information on these options. If you specify more
                 than one option, separate the options with commas (for
                 example, OPTIONS A,N).

                 The system displays the following:

                 It is 28-JUN-1996 at 10:45.

                 Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

                 If you do not supply either the product name or the
                 device name, VMSINSTAL prompts you for this information
                 later in the installation procedure. VMSINSTAL
                 does not prompt you for any options, so be sure to
                 include OPTIONS N on the VMSINSTAL command procedure
                 command line to access the release notes during the
                 installation.

              3. Confirm system backup.

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? y

                 You must back up the system disk before performing an
                 installation. If you are satisfied with the backup of
                 the system disk, press Return. If you are not satisfied,
                 enter N to stop the installation. After you back up the
                 system disk, you can restart the installation.

              4. Mount the media.

                 You must now mount the first distribution volume on the
                 device if you specified one when you invoked VMSINSTAL.
                 An example follows:

                 Please mount the first volume of the set on MTA0:.

                 * Are you ready? YES
                 %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED, BASEstar CIMfast for OpenVMS VAX MOUNTED ON _$$MTA0:(NODE 1)

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set A ...

                 Now mount the first distribution volume on the device
                 you specified when you invoked VMSINSTAL. The device
                 name is displayed in the line preceding the question.
                 VMSINSTAL then asks you if you are ready to continue
                 with the installation. If you enter Y to indicate
                 that you are ready, VMSINSTAL displays a message that
                 the media containing BASEstar Classic CIMfast has
                 been mounted on the specified device and that the
                 installation has started. If you enter the wrong device
                 name when you invoke VMSINSTAL and need to restart
                 the installation, enter N in response to the following
                 question:

                 Are you ready? To abort the installation, press Ctrl/Y.

              5. Mount additional media volumes.

                 If your installation kit contains more than one volume,
                 VMSINSTAL prompts you to mount the additional volumes
                 and then asks you to indicate that you are ready to
                 continue the installation of BASEstar Classic CIMfast:

                 %BACKUP-I-READYREAD, mount volume 2 on _MTA0: for reading

                 Enter "YES" when ready:

              6. Choose a release notes option.

                    VMSINSTAL displays the release notes on the console
                    terminal and then prompts you for a queue name for
                    the printed version.

                 o  Option 4

                    Choose this option if you have already read the

                 You can install the following options:

                 o  Cimfast DCM support.

                    If you have BASEstar Classic DCM (Device Connection
                    Manager) installed on your system, you have the
                    option of installing CIMfast DCM programming support
                    option.

                 o  Cimfast SQL support.

                        In order to install CIMfast SQL support for RDB,
                        a minimum of RDB V6.0 must be installed on your system.
                        If you answer YES RDB installation, this version check will
                        be done.

                    * Do You want to install CIMfast SQL Support for DEC RDB [YES]?

                    The installation checks for the existence of DEC
                    RDB and Oracle software, and the previous existance
                    of CIMfast SQL support. If BOTH RDB and Oracle
                    are found, the procedure will prompt you for which
                    software you choose to use with CIMfast SQL support.

                    The database software MUST be started properly prior
                    to the installation of CIMfast, and the logical
                    SQL$DATABASE must be defined in order to run the
                    IVP test procedure properly for CIMfast SQL support
                    in your selected database. If no logical SQL$DATABASE
                    is found the IVP will display a database location for
                    its use or allow a change before the procedure runs.

                    The installation procedure checks for the existence
                    of the DMQ$USER logical to determine whether
                    DECmessageQ is installed. It is possible for
                    DECmessageQ to have been installed and the DMQ$USER
                    logical to remain undefined. If the DMQ$USER logical
                    is not defined, the following message is displayed:

                             Is DECmessageQ installed on this system and do You
                             want to have the CIMfast DMQ support installed ?

                             If You answer 'Yes', the CIMfast installation will
                             be aborted and You have to to run the file DMQ$STARTUP
                             in the [EXE] directory of Your DMQ installation.

                             If You answer 'No', the CIMfast installation continues
                             without installing the CIMfast DMQ support.

                    * Do You want to install the CIMfast DMQ support  [YES]?

                    The previous message indicates that you have the
                    following options:

                    o  Abort the installation, run the DMQ$STARTUP file,
                       and restart the installation.

                    o  Continue the installation without installing
                       BASEstar Classic CIMfast DECmessageQ support.

                 o  LSE support

                    * Do you want to install LSE support [YES]?

                    You can install CIMfast support for the Language-

                    You can purge files from previous versions of
                    BASEstar Classic CIMfast that are superseded by this
                    installation. Purging is recommended, but if you want
                    to keep files from the previous version, enter N in
                    response to the question:

                    * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

                 o  Choose the installation verification procedure (IVP)
                    option.

                    The installation procedure now asks you if you want
                    to run the IVP:

                    * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

                    The IVP for BASEstar Classic CIMfast checks that the
                    installation is successful. Digital recommends that
                    you run the IVP. If the SQL support was installed, it
                    will be tested with the supporting database (RDB or
                    Oracle) option. BASEstar must be running in order for
                    the SQL portion of the IVP to run successfully.

                    After BASEstar Classic CIMfast is installed, you may
                    run the IVP independently to verify that the software
                    is available and working on the system. You may need
                    to run the IVP after a system failure to make sure
                    that other users can access BASEstar Classic CIMfast.

                 o  Read informational messages.

                    The BASEstar Classic CIMfast installation procedure
                    displays a number of informational messages that
                    report on the progress of the installation. If the
                    installation procedure has been successful up to this
                    point, VMSINSTAL moves the new or modified files to
                    their target directories, updates or installs the
                    example files, and updates DCL tables, if necessary.
                    If you chose to have files purged, that task is now
                    complete. The following message is displayed:

                            All questions regarding the installation of CIMfast have been

              This chapter describes BASEstar Classic and CIMfast
              postinstallation tasks.

        3.1 BASEstar Classic Postinstallation Procedures

              When you have completed the BASEstar Classic installation
              procedures, log in to the system manager's account and
              perform the following steps:

              1. Delete BASEstar Ada files if not needed (optional).

                 Certain Ada declarations files are rather large; if
                 no Ada programming will be done at your site, you may
                 want to delete the file SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]BCC_.ADA
                 (approximately 1400 blocks) and the ILAN*.ADA files in
                 that same directory.

              2. Address VMScluster considerations (optional).

                 If you have a VMScluster and have installed BASEstar
                 software numerous times on several nodes of the cluster,
                 you may want to "synchronize" the INSTALLed (VMS Known
                 File Entry) file versions of various shareable images in
                 SYS$COMMON:. Then, purge those files.

                 a. Enter the following commands at the DCL prompt:

                    $ dir/size  SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]DCLTABLES.EXE
                    $ dir/size  SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]BCC$*.EXE,ILAN$*.EXE
                    $ dir/size  SYS$COMMON:[SYSMSG]BCC$*.EXE,ILAN$*.EXE

                 b. If any multiple file versions are present, continue;
                    otherwise, no further action is needed. Enter the
                    following commands:

                    $ INSTALL := $INSTALL/COMMAND_MODE
                    $ MCR SYSMAN
                    SYSMAN> set environment /cluster
                    SYSMAN> do INSTALL LIST   SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]DCLTABLES.EXE

                                                     Postinstallation 3-1

 



        Postinstallation
        3.1 BASEstar Classic Postinstallation Procedures


                 c. Examine the file version number shown for each node.
                    If the version number is not the same for every node,
                    enter the following command to synchronize all nodes
                    on the highest version (use command line recall
                    to recall the prior command and change the LIST to
                    REPLACE):

                    SYSMAN> do INSTALL REPLACE SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]DCLTABLES.EXE

                 d. Repeat steps b and c for each BCC$ and ILAN$
                    shareable image in SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB] and [SYSMSG].
                    The file type will be .EXE. Refer to the files shown
                    in step 2a.

                 e. To exit SYSMAN, enter:

                    SYSMAN> exit   (or Ctrl/Z)

                 f. If multiple versions of any shareable images were
                    found, you may now carefully purge those files. This
                    should free a sizable number of disk blocks (the
                    BCC$SHR.EXE image alone is more than 3600 blocks).

              3. Back up the system disk.

                 Back up the system disk after installing BASEstar
                 software. The procedure for backing up the system disk
                 is described in the OpenVMS System Management Utilities
                 Reference Manual.

              4. Edit the system startup procedure.

                 If you want BASEstar software to automatically start
                 when the system boots, add the following line to the
                 SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM file:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:BCC$STARTUP.COM

                 To automatically start BASEstar device connection
                 management when the system boots, add the following
                 line to the SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM file:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:ILAN$STARTUP.COM

                 The device control management CLI and API timeouts
                 with the ILAN$DEVSRV process are controlled by the
                 ILAN$DEFAULT_TIMEOUT logical. Refer to the BASEstar
                 Classic Configuration and Tuning Guide for additional
                 information. Depending on the types of device access
                 your system will be performing, consider defining
                 this logical in the system logical name table in

                 SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM. This is especially true
                 if you have long uploads and downloads and you enable
                 the ILAN$UP_DOWN_TIME paramater as described in the
                 BASEstar Classic Configuration and Tuning Guide.

              5. Set process quotas.

                 Ensure that BASEstar user processes have quotas equal to
                 or greater than those listed in Table 3-1 or Table 3-2.

              6. Select BASEstar users.

                 Grant the BCC$USER identifier to the SYSTEM account and
                 /or any other accounts you will be using to start or
                 stop the BASEstar system using the OpenVMS Authorize
                 Utility (AUTHORIZE) as follows:

                 UAF> GRANT/IDENTIFIER  BCC$USER  username

                 where username is the name of the user account.

              7. Set privileges.

                 Ensure that each BASEstar user has the following minimum
                 OpenVMS privileges:

                 o  TMPMBX

                 o  NETMBX

              8. Create DECmessageQ logical name table (if using
                 DECmessageQ).

                 Before BASEstar applications using DECmessageQ messaging
                 can initiate data changes via the API or receive data
                 change notification via the API and CLI, DECmessageQ
                 logical names must be defined. DECmessageQ relies on
                 logical names to locate DECmessageQ files. These logical

                 names must be defined in order for a process to send
                 DECmessageQ messages.

                 For more information about defining DECmessageQ logical
                 names, refer to the BASEstar Classic Release Notes.

              9. Ensure that DECnet is running.

                 BASEstar software will not run unless DECnet software
                 is running. If DECnet is stopped, BASEstar software will
                 shut down.

              10.Start DECmessageQ (if using DECmessageQ).

                 If you will be using DECmessageQ messaging with
                 BASEstar applications, DECmessageQ software must be
                 started before starting BASEstar. For more information
                 on starting DECmessageQ, refer to the DECmessageQ
                 Management and Configuration Guide for OpenVMS.

              11.Start BASEstar software.

                 BASEstar software can be started from the SYSTEM account
                 after this account has been granted the BCC$USER
                 identifier. It can also be started from any account
                 having the following privileges. These privileges must
                 be in the account's Authorized Privilege list and are
                 added using AUTHORIZE.

                 ALTPRI   DETACH   LOG_IO

                 NETMBX   PHY_IO   PSWAPM

                 SHARE    SYSGBL   SYSLCK

                 SYSNAM   TMPMBX

                 Though accounts used to start BASEstar require these
                 privileges in their Authorized Privilege list, they
                 do not require them in their Default Privilege list
                 for security reasons. The previous list represents the
                 minimum privileges needed by all BASEstar processes
                 and applications. Some BASEstar processes may not need
                 all privileges and can be started with only a subset.
                 Whenever new applications need privileges not in this
                 list, these privileges can be added to the account's
                 Authorized Privilege list. The new privileges are in
                 effect only after the user logs out and logs back in.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                The SYSTEM account must be granted the BCC$USER
                identifier regardless of whether it will be used
                to start BASEstar. Failure to grant the BCC$USER
                identifier to the SYSTEM account will cause BASEstar
                startup attempts to fail.

                 Digital recommends that you run the installation
                 verification procedure (IVP) during the installation.
                 If you want to run the IVP separately to ensure the
                 integrity of the installed files, execute the following
                 command procedure:

                 $ @SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSTEST.BCF]BCF$IVP.COM

              2. Edit the system startup file.

                 You must edit the system startup file to provide for
                 automatic startup of BASEstar Classic CIMfast when the
                 system is rebooted.

                 Add the command line that starts BASEstar
                 Classic CIMfast to the system startup file,
                 SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM. The following example
                 shows a BASEstar CIMfast for OpenVMS VAX startup command
                 line:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:BCF$STARTUP.COM

              3. Modify BASEstar parameters.

                 There is one BASEstar parameter whose value you may
                 need to increase to use BASEstar Classic CIMfast on the
                 system. The parameter is BCC$DMGT_MAX_REQUESTS, which
                 controls the number of data point change notification
                 requests that may be outstanding on the BASEstar system.

                 For every data point with update or change notification
                 requested in a CEL program, one data point change
                 notification request is required.

                 If several CIMfast applications using large numbers of
                 data points are running simultaneously on the system,
                 you might need to increase the value of this parameter.
                 Use the following formula to decide whether to increase
                 this parameter:

                 v a*v

                 where v is the value of the BCC$DMGT_MAX_REQUESTS
                 parameter, a is the number of applications running, and
                 p is the number of points per application. For example,
                 if you have 10 applications running, and each one uses
                 11 data points (the same or different data points), then
                 set the value of the BCC$DMGT_MAX_REQUESTS parameter to
                 at least 110.

                 A suggested value for the BCC$DMGT_MAX_REQUESTS
                 parameter is 1000.

                 You can modify this parameter using the following
                 command:

                 $ BSTAR SET PARAM BCC$DMGT_MAX_REQUESTS 1000

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                You must stop and restart BASEstar for this change to
                take effect.

                ______________________________________________________

              4. Address VMScluster considerations.

                 BASEstar Classic CIMfast is fully supported in a
                 VMScluster environment. To guarantee the full VMScluster
                 support after the installation of BASEstar Classic
                 CIMfast, you must follow these steps:

                 1. Define several CIMfast-related logical names before
                    using BASEstar Classic CIMfast on a BASEstar Classic
                    CIMfast system.

                    Define CIMfast-related logical names by executing the
                    procedure SYS$STARTUP:BCF$STARTUP.COM.

                 2. During the installation of BASEstar Classic CIMfast,
                    a new DCL command (CIMFAST) is provided. Ensure
                    that the DCL command definition of the node on which
                    the BASEstar Classic CIMfast installation has taken
                    place (SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES.EXE) is used or propagated
                    throughout the whole cluster.

              5. Modify user accounts.

                 To work with BASEstar Classic CIMfast, you must execute
                 the CIMfast startup procedure (BCF$HOME:BCF$SETUP)
                 and have sufficient account quotas. The file
                 BCF$HOME:BCF$SETUP.COM, installed during the CIMfast
                 installation, must be executed as part of each user's
                 login procedure. Alternatively, you can execute this
                 file from the systemwide login command procedure,
                 SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM.

                 Make sure that the appropriate user accounts have
                 sufficient quotas to use BASEstar Classic CIMfast.
                 Table 3-4 summarizes the required user account quotas.

                 User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT.
                 Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to verify
                 and change user account quotas as follows:

                 1. Set your directory to SYS$SYSTEM and enter the
                    OpenVMS VAX command AUTHORIZE:

                    $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
                    $ RUN AUTHORIZE
                    UAF>

                 2. At the UAF> prompt, enter the SHOW command with
                    an account name to check a particular account. The
                    following example checks the SMITH account:

                    UAF> SHOW SMITH

                 3. To change a quota, enter the MODIFY command.

                    The following example changes the WSEXTENT quota for
                    the SMITH account and then exits from the utility:

                    UAF> MODIFY SMITH /WSEXTENT=1024
                    UAF> EXIT

                    After you exit from the utility, the system displays
                    messages indicating whether the changes were made.
                    Once the changes have been made, you must log out and
                    log in again for the new quotas to take effect.

                 For more information on modifying account quotas, see
                 the description of the Authorize Utility in the OpenVMS
                 System Management Subkit.

              6. Install BASEstar Classic CIMfast as a shared image.

        Postinstallation
        3.2 BASEstar Classic CIMfast Postinstallation Procedures


                 If BASEstar Classic CIMfast is to be used extensively
                 on the system, you can reduce the system overhead and
                 memory requirements by installing BASEstar Classic
                 CIMfast as a shared image.

                 To install BASEstar Classic CIMfast as a shared image
                 on a system that is currently running, use the OpenVMS
                 Install Utility (INSTALL). It is recommended that you
                 install BASEstar Classic CIMfast as a shared image on
                 a system that has recently been rebooted because the
                 available space in the global page table is less likely
                 to be fragmented.

                 Installing BASEstar Classic CIMfast as a shared image
                 requires 4 global sections and 250 global pages. To
                 install BASEstar Classic CIMfast as a shared image,
                 follow these steps:

                 1. Determine the number of available global pages and
                    global sections on the system using the following
                    command:

                    $ INSTALL LIST/GLOBAL/SUMMARY

                    The values for the global pages and global sections
                    are controlled by the system parameters GBLSECTIONS
                    and GBLPAGES. You may need to increase the values of
                    these parameters to meet the required numbers of 4
                    global sections and 250 global pages.

                    Use the AUTOGEN mechanism for any modifications to
                    system parameters. See the OpenVMS System Manager's
                    Manual for more information about changing the system
                    parameters.

                 2. Reset the system parameter values.

                 3. Invoke the OpenVMS Install Utility from a privileged
                    account and then install BASEstar Classic CIMfast as
                    a shared image:

                    $ INSTALL
                    INSTALL> ADD BCF$ROOT:[EXE]BCF$SHR.EXE /OPEN HEAD/ SHARED
                    INSTALL> EXIT

                 3.2 BASEstar Classic CIMfast Postinstallation Procedures


                 To install BASEstar Classic CIMfast as a shared image
                 when the system boots, remove the comment symbols (!)
                 from the following lines in SYS$STARTUP:BCF$STARTUP.COM:

                 $! IF
                 F$FILE_ATTRIBUTES("BCF$ROOT:[EXE]BCF$SHR.EXE","KNOWN") THEN -
                 $!    INSTALL REMOVE BCF$ROOT:[EXE]BCF$SHR
                 $! INSTALL ADD BCF$ROOT:[EXE]BCF$SHR/OPEN/HEAD/SHARE

              7. Generate BASEstar Classic CIMfast logicals.

                 The logical names created by the BASEstar Classic
                 CIMfast installation procedures are both /SYSTEM
                 and /PROCESS logical names. The system logical names
                 are stored in the product's startup file and are
                 automatically entered into the system logical name
                 table when the system reboots or when the software is
                 invoked. The process logical names are entered into the
                 process logical name table when BCF$HOME:BCF$SETUP.COM
                 is executed. Table 3-5 lists the logical names created
                 by the installation procedures.

                  This node is a member of a multi-node VMScluster.

                  A single-node installation or a multi-node installation
                  can be chosen.   For a multi-node installation, the nodes
                  must share a cluster common system disk, and so must all
                  be of the same architecture type (AXP or VAX).

              * Do you want to install BASEstar on just one node [YES]? NO
               (NOTE: Answering NO will perform a multi-node install. If only
               a single note installation is desired, chose the defaut of yes.)

                  A VMScluster installation will be performed.   The current node,
                  SRVR4, will be the first node in the installation.

                  You must now enter a list of the node names of all BASEstar
                  Global Name Server systems with which the newly-installed
                  BASEstar node (or nodes) will interact.  This list is
                  required for both new Global Name Server systems and for
                  new Name Dispatcher systems.

                  For your convenience, the list will start with the list of
                  nodes in this installation that you designated earlier to
                  be configured as Global Name Servers.

              Current Global Name Server list is:  SRVR4, BST1

              %BCCVA-I-QUORUMSET, Global Name Server quorum will be set to 2

                  If the above quorum value is not consistent with other Global Name
                  Server systems in the same BASEstar domain, the value of BCC$QUORUM
                  should be changed after the installation is finished and before
                  BASEstar is started on this node for the first time.

                  IF this is a V3.3 to V3.4 UPGRADE, a data base conversion will execute
                  during the IVP.  This conversion requires user input regarding log
                  file locations.  The IVP will announce the beginning of the data base
                  conversions, before prompting for logging information.
                  The installation  time  will  vary  depending on the number of nodes
                  selected  for  installation  and  the type of processor on which
                  the installation is being done.
                  If the data base conversions are required, time will vary depending on
                  the size of your BASEstar Classic object data base.

                  This installation creates a VMS rights identifier named BCC$USER,
                  which is used to control access to BASEstar.

                  After the installation is finished, the VMS Authorize Utility
                  must be used to grant this identifier to all accounts that will
                  use BASEstar.

                  Each VMS user account that will issue BSTAR commands must be
                  granted the BCC$USER rights identifier, as well as having
                  certain Authorized privileges set.

                  >> Remember to grant the BCC$USER identifier to the SYSTEM account
                  >> (and/or any other accounts you will be using to start the BASEstar

        A.2 Device Connection Management installation


                  ILAN$STARTUP.COM, a startup command procedure, is used
                  to set up the environment for Device Connect Management.
                  During the installation, this file will be placed in the
                  SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYS$STARTUP]  directory of the nodes on
                  which this installation is being performed.

                  If this is a first-time DCM installation on a this system,
                  the system startup command procedure

                              SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM
                  or
                SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM
                          (for VAX VMS versions prior to V6.0)

                  needs to be manually edited (after this installation has
                  successfully finished).   Locate the line

                              $  @ SYS$STARTUP:BCC$STARTUP.COM

                  and add this new line immediately after the BCC$STARTUP
                  line:
                              $  @ SYS$STARTUP:ILAN$STARTUP.COM

                  ----------------------------------------------------------
                  The installation procedure has no further questions to ask
                  and can continue from this point without user assistance.
                  The time needed to finish the installation will vary
                  depending on the number of nodes selected for installation
                  and the type of processors and disks involved.

               asked. Depending upon system load and configuration the
               installation will take between 5 and 15 minutes.

               This installation provides a system startup file
                   SYS$STARTUP:BCF$STARTUP.COM.  You must edit your
                   system startup procedure(s) to invoke this file
               on each node where CIMfast will be run.

               The CIMfast per-user setup command procedure is in
               BCF$HOME:BCF$SETUP.COM. It should be executed at login
               time by each CIMfast user, by including a line such as
               the following in each user's LOGIN.COM procedure:

                   $ @BCF$HOME:BCF$SETUP

               Alternatively, the above line may added to the system-wide
               login command procedure (usually SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM).

                                            B.1 Main Upgrade Installation


                     This BASEstar Classic System is being upgraded from V3.3 to V3.4.
                     This upgrade will convert the object data bases on each system
                     upgraded, which requires that the data global sections be deleted.
                     This will cause all BASEstar logical data points to be set to their
                     initial value on the first startup after this installation,
                     including points that are set PERSISTANT.
                     For more information on the data base conversions, please read
                     the BASEstar Classic V3.4 release notes before upgrading.

              * Do you wish to continue this installation [YES]? YES

                  The installation procedure  has  no further questions to ask during
                  the installation process.  Until the IVP executes, it can continue
                  without user assistance.
                  IF this is a V3.3 to V3.4 UPGRADE, a data base conversion will execute
                  during the IVP.  This conversion requires user input regarding log
                  file locations.  The IVP will announce the beginning of the data base
                  conversions, before prompting for logging information.
                  The installation  time  will  vary  depending on the number of nodes
                  selected  for  installation  and  the type of processor on which
                  the installation is being done.
                  If the data base conversions are required, time will vary depending on
                  the size of your BASEstar Classic object data base.

                  This installation creates a VMS rights identifier named BCC$USER,
                  which is used to control access to BASEstar.

                  After the installation is finished, the VMS Authorize Utility
                  must be used to grant this identifier to all accounts that will
                  use BASEstar.

              The BASEstar Classic V3.4 Data Base Conversions can be logged
              This would provide files with object definitions of the V3.3
              environment being converted.
              If requested, these files can be VERY large, and so their
              location should be a scratch disk, that is NOT the BCC$SYSDATA
              disk.  This way, the conversions can complete, even if the log files
              use up the entire disk.

                   system startup procedure(s) to invoke this file
               on each node where CIMfast will be run.

               The CIMfast per-user setup command procedure is in
               BCF$HOME:BCF$SETUP.COM. It should be executed at login
               time by each CIMfast user, by including a line such as
               the following in each user's LOGIN.COM procedure:

                   $ @BCF$HOME:BCF$SETUP

               Alternatively, the above line may added to the system-wide
               login command procedure (usually SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM).

              This appendix lists BASEstar files created during the
              installation of the BASEstar software including its device
              connection management, and utility software. Note that
              the directory locations in which the files are placed
              reflect the default placement of files by each installation
              procedure.

        C.1 Files Created by BASEstar Installation Procedure

              Table C-1 lists the files created during the BASEstar main
              installation. These files are present only when BASEstar
              data management, menu interface, and external data support
              software are installed. Do not delete any of these files.
