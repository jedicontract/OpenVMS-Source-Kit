          PRODUCT NAME:  OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Operating System,     SPD 25.G6.17
                         V7.2

          DESCRIPTION

          OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX V7.2 is the Hanzi (Simplified Chinese) version of
          the OpenVMS V7.2 operating system. OpenVMS/ Hanzi VAX extends Open-
          VMS VAX to provide an operating system environment to support Chinese
          and ASCII characters on VAX series computers. On top of the basic func-
          tions of OpenVMS, OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX extends and enhances the system
          utilities and environment to process Chinese data. Utilities are pro-
          vided to facilitate the design and maintenance of user-defined char-
          acters. Output of user-defined characters is supported on DEC Hanzi
          terminals and printers via On-Demand Loading, a dynamic font loading
          feature.

          OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX supports Simplified Chinese data representation that
          conforms to the Primary Set of National Standard Code of Chinese Graphic
          Character Set for Information Interchange (GB2312-80) of the People's
          Republic of China. In addition, OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX supports an exten-
          sion area of 8,836 character positions in the form of user-defined char-
          acters.

          This SPD describes only the Chinese specific features of OpenVMS/Hanzi
          VAX which are extensions or additions to OpenVMS. For a description
          of the base functionality and supported environment of OpenVMS, please
          refer to OpenVMS Operating System for Alpha and VAX V7.2 SPD (SPD 25.01.xx).

          editing support for both Chinese and ASCII characters.

          User-defined Characters Support

          OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX can display user-defined characters on Chinese ter-
          minals and printers which support the On-Demand Loading and Pre-loading
