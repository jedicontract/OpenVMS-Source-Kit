              This chapter discusses the preparations and requirements
              necessary for installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX.

        1.1 Software Prerequisites

        1.1.1 Required Base Operating System

              OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Version 7.2 requires the OpenVMS VAX
              Version 7.2 operating system. OpenVMS VAX Version 7.2
              must be installed and running on the system before OpenVMS
              /Hanzi VAX Version 7.2 is installed.

              OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Version 7.2 also requires the XPG4
              locale database for the DEC Hanzi Character Set. This
              database is in the VMSI18N072 kit that is provided on
              the same media as the OpenVMS VAX Version 7.2 operating
              system. It is not installed during the installation of
              OpenVMS VAX Version 7.2. To install this database, install
              the VMSI18N072 kit using VMSINSTAL procedure after the
              installation of OpenVMS VAX Version 7.2 is complete. Be
              sure to answer YES to the question "Do you want Chinese
              support?"

              If you are planning to set up an international environment
              in your system, you must select other locale databases
              during the installation of the VMSI18N072 kit. You can
              install the locale databases after the VMSI18N072 kit is
              installed if necessary. Please refer to the OpenVMS VAX
              Version 7.2 Upgrade and Installation Manual for details.

        Preparing for OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Installation
        1.1 Software Prerequisites

        1.1.2 Required Layered Product

              To enable World-Wide PostScript printing subsystem
              feature provided by OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Version 7.2, it
              requires to install DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS (DCPS)
              Version 1.0C or higher. For details on the installation
              of DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS, please refer to
              DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS Release Notes and DECprint
              Supervisor for OpenVMS Software Installation Guide.

        1.2 Prerequisite Hardware

              OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Version 7.2 requires the following
              hardware:

              o  Any valid VAX configuration supported by OpenVMS VAX
                 Version 7.2

              o  VT382-CB Chinese terminal

        1.3 License Registration

              You must register and load your license for OpenVMS/Hanzi
              VAX Version 7.2 before you start the installation in order
              to run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and
              use the software.

              To register a license under OpenVMS, first log in to the
              system manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice
              of two ways to perform the registration:

              o  Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When
                 it prompts you for information, respond with data from
                 your License PAK.

              o  At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command
                 with the appropriate qualifiers that correspond to
                 License PAK information.

              For complete information on using LMF, see OpenVMS License
              Management Utility Manual.

                            Preparing for OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Installation
                     1.4 Obtaining Installation Key for Layered Products

        1.4 Obtaining Installation Key for Layered Products

              Some layered products require an Installation Key upon
              installation. For installation of such layered products,
              it is required to install the INSTALL072 kit bundled with
              OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Version 7.2. Please follow the steps
              below to obtain an Installation Key:

              1. Install the INSTALL072 kit on your system. This kit
                 is bundled with the OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Version 7.2 kit.
                 Install this kit with VMSINSTAL as follows:

                 $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL INSTALL072 source-device

                 where source-device is the device on which the
                 distribution media (i.e. the OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Version
                 7.2 distribution media) is mounted.

              2. Run the image SYS$UPDATE:INSTALL_ID.EXE to obtain an
                 installation ID as follows:

                 $ RUN SYS$UPDATE:INSTALL_ID
                 ==============================================
                 Installation ID Reporting Utility V1.0
                 ==============================================

                 Installation ID   = A-1D2-3E-0T-ABCB
                 ==============================================

                 Record the installation ID on a piece of paper. In the
                 above case, the installation ID is A-1D2-3E-0T-ABCB.
                 Note that the installation ID is case sensitive.

              Note that you have to obtain an Installation Key for each
              node that the specific layered product is run on.

              For more information on Installation Key generation,
              please contact Compaq's Multivendor Customer Services.

        1.6.1 System Parameters

              Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX requires certain system
              parameter available resources. Table 1-2 lists the minimum
              required system parameter values for installation.

              Table_1-2_System_Parameter_Requirement____________________

              Parameter_name________Minimum_value_______________________

              GBLPAGES              2,900 pages

              GBLSECTIONS___________40_sections_________________________

              To determine the number of free global pages and global
              sections on the system: first you can use the SYSGEN
              utility to check the current value of global pages and
              global sections. For example:

              $ MCR SYSGEN
              SYSGEN> SHOW GBLPAGES
              SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS
              SYSGEN> EXIT

              Then, enter the following command at DCL prompt to display
              global pages and global sections usage on the system.

              $ INSTALL LIST /GLOBAL /SUMMARY

              The difference of the two figures must be greater than or
              equal to the minimum values required for installation.

        1.6.2 Process Account Quotas

              The account you use to install OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX must
              have sufficient quotas to enable you to perform the
              installation. Table 1-3 summarizes the process account
              quotas required for the installation account.

              ENQLM                 200

              FILLM_________________300_________________________________

              The installation procedure checks your account quotas at
              the beginning of the installation. For each account quota
              that is below the minimum requirement, the installation
              procedure displays a message that shows your account quota
              and the minimum requirement. If any of your account quotas
              is indeed below the minimum requirement, the installation
              procedure will ask whether you want to continue with
              the installation. You can answer YES to continue but
              the installation may or may not complete successfully.
              Alternatively, you can answer NO or press the <Return>
              key to abort the installation. Then you can correct the
              account quotas and restart the installation.

              User account quotas are stored in the file SYSUAF.DAT.
              You can use the Authorize utility to verify and change
              user account quotas. First set your default directory to
              SYS$SYSTEM and then run AUTHORIZE:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
              $ RUN AUTHORIZE
              UAF>

              At the Authorize utility prompt (UAF>), use the SHOW
              command with an account name to check a particular
              account. For example:

              UAF> SHOW SYSTEM

              To change the quota, use the MODIFY command at the UAF>
              prompt. For example, to change the FILLM quota for the
              SYSTEM account and then exit, you can type the following:

              UAF> MODIFY SYSTEM/FILLM=300
              UAF> EXIT

              After you exit from the Authorize utility, the OpenVMS
              operating system displays messages indicating whether or
              not changes were made. Once the changes have been made,
              the owner of the altered account must log out and then log
              in again for the new quotas to take effect.

              For more information on modifying account quotas, see
              the description of the Authorize utility in the OpenVMS
              Documentation Set.

        1.6.3 Backing Up Your System Disk

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL procedure
              asks if you have backed up your system disk. Compaq
              recommends that you do a system disk backup before
              installing any software.

              Use the backup procedures that have been established
              at your site. For details on performing a system disk
              backup, see the section on Backup utility in the OpenVMS
              documentation set.

        1.7 Warning on OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Upgrades

              OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX can only be installed on the correspond-
              ing version of OpenVMS VAX. When you upgrade OpenVMS/Hanzi
              VAX system, you have to:

              1. Upgrade the base OpenVMS VAX system.

              2. Then, install the OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX kit on the upgraded
                 base OpenVMS VAX system.

              To upgrade the base OpenVMS VAX system, you have to:

              1. Remove the HSY$STARTUP.COM startup command procedure
                 of OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX from the system startup sequence.
                 In other words, SYS$STARTUP:HSY$STARTUP.COM should
                 be taken out from SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM site
                 specific startup command procedure or removed from the
                 SYSMAN utility as a startup file.

                6.1 and have not applied the AVMSMUP01_061 mup kit,
                you must reset the SYSGEN parameter LGI_CALLOUTS to
                0 before rebooting the system, as follows:

                           $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSMAN
                           SYSMAN> PARAMETER USE CURRENT
                           SYSMAN> PARAMETER SET LGI_CALLOUTS 0
                           SYSMAN> PARAMETER WRITE CURRENT
                           SYSMAN> EXIT

                Otherwise, you may not be able to log into your
                system after reboot.

                _____________________________________________________

              4. After the system has been rebooted, upgrade the base
                 OpenVMS VAX operating system.

        1.8 Examining VAXVMSSYS.PAR File

              Before you begin an installation for OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX,
              be sure the file protection of the VAXVMSSYS.PAR file
              stored in SYS$SYSTEM directory is "System:RWED,Owner:RWED,
              Group:RE,World:RE". If it is incorrect, you need to change
              the file protection of the VAXVMSSYS.PAR file with the
              following command.

              $ SET FILE /PROTECTION=(S:RWED, O:RWED, G:RE, W:RE) -

                                            Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX



              This chapter describes how to install the OpenVMS/Hanzi
              VAX Version 7.2 operating system. Section 3.1.2 contains a
              step-by-step description of the installation procedure.

        3.1 The Installation Procedure

              The OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX installation process consists of a
              series of questions and informational messages.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              <CTRL/Y>. However, when you abort the installation
              procedure, it does not delete files created up to
              that point. You must delete those files interactively.
              Appendix C lists the files created by this installation
              procedure and the directories in which they reside.
              Note that all files and directories are created under
              SYS$COMMON.

        3.1.1 Invoking VMSINSTAL

              To start the installation, invoke the VMSINSTAL procedure
              from a privileged account, such as the SYSTEM account.
              VMSINSTAL procedure is in the SYS$UPDATE directory. You
              use the following syntax to invoke VMSINSTAL procedure:

              $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL HANZI072 device-name [OPTIONS N]

              HANZI072
              This refers to the OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Version 7.2 saveset.

              device-name
              The name of the device on which you plan to mount the
              media. For example, DKA400: is the device name for a
              compact disc drive. It is not necessary to use the console
              drive for this installation. However, if you do use the

              removed once the installation is completed.

              [OPTIONS N]
              This portion of the command line invokes the release notes
              option, allowing you to display or save a copy of the
              release notes. This portion is optional. If you omit
              this option, the Release Notes question is omitted from
              the VMSINSTAL procedure dialog and the release notes are
              automatically copied to SYS$HELP.

              Note that there are several options you can select
              when you invoke VMSINSTAL procedure. See the OpenVMS
              Documentation Set on software installation for information
              on those options.

              The following example displays the command to invoke
              VMSINSTAL procedure to install OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Version
              7.2 from compact disk drive DKA400: and shows the system
              response:

              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              If you do not supply either the product name or the device
              name, VMSINSTAL procedure will prompt you for information
              later on in the installation process. VMSINSTAL procedure
              does not prompt you for any options.

        3.1.2 Installation Questions

              This section discusses the questions that appear
              during the installation. Appendix A contains a sample
              installation log showing how the questions can be
              answered.

              Each question in the installation is marked with an
              asterisk (*) at the beginning of the line. Some questions
              show the default response in brackets, for example [YES].

              1. System backup

                 VMSINSTAL procedure asks if you are satisfied with your
                 system backup using the following question:

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

                 You should always back up your system disk before
                 performing an installation. If you are satisfied
                 with the backup of your system disk, press <Return>.
                 Otherwise, enter NO to discontinue the installation.
                 After backing up your system disk, you can restart the
                 installation.

                 If you respond YES, VMSINSTAL procedure displays a
                 message showing that the installation has begun. For
                 example:

                 The following products will be processed:

                   HANZI V7.2

        Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX
        3.1 The Installation Procedure

                 If you select 4, the release notes are copied to
                 HANZI072.RELEASE_NOTES in SYS$HELP.

                 If you select 5, the release notes are not printed,
                 displayed, or copied to SYS$HELP.

                 If you did not include the OPTIONS N portion of the
                 VMSINSTAL command line, the following message is
                 displayed:

                 %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been moved to SYS$HELP.

              3. Product Authorization Key

                 The installation procedure wants to make sure you have
                 registered and loaded the product authorization key
                 (PAK) of OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX before it checks for its
                 validity. It asks you with the following question:

                 * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

                 If you answer NO, the installation procedure will stop.
                 If you answer YES but you actually have not loaded the
                 PAK, the Installation Verification Procedure will fail
                 out when it checks the validity of the PAK.

              4. DECwindows Motif/Hanzi fonts

                 The saveset of OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX contains the font
                 files of DECwindows Motif/Hanzi. If you have installed
                 or are planning to install DECwindows Motif/Hanzi
                 V1.2-3 or above to your system, you are recommended
                 to install the fonts by answering YES to the question:

                 * Do you want to install DECwindows Motif /Hanzi fonts [YES]?

                 If you answer NO to the question, the font files will
                 not be installed.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If you choose to install the DECwindows Motif/Hanzi
                fonts, the installation procedure will display a
                warning message as follows

        3-4 Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX

                     %COPY-W-INCOMPAT,
                     VMI$ROOT:[SYSFONT.DECW.75DPI]DECW$FONT_ALIAS_GS.DAT (input) and
                     VMI$ROOT:[SYSFONT.DECW.75DPI]DECW$FONT_ALIAS.DAT (output) have
                     incompatible attributes

                This warning message can be safely ignored.

                _____________________________________________________

              5. Purge replaced files

                 If you have successfully mounted the media, VMSINSTAL
                 procedure proceeds to restore the saveset A of OpenVMS
                 /Hanzi VAX and move the release notes to SYS$HELP.

                 It then asks if you want to purge the files replaced by
                 the installation of OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX as follows:

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]?

                 If you answer NO, the old files with the same name
                 in the same directory will remain there. Usually you
                 answer YES to save disk space.

              6. Delete SYS$SPECIFIC files

                 OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX puts its component files in the
                 directories under SYS$COMMON. However, if there are
                 files under SYS$SPECIFIC possessing the same name,
                 those files under SYS$SPECIFIC will be used instead of
                 those under SYS$COMMON. So it is essential to delete
                 those SYS$SPECIFIC files in order for OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX
                 to run successfully.

                 You can have the installation procedure to delete those
                 SYS$SPECIFIC files by answering YES to the question:

                 * Do you want to delete files in SYS$SPECIFIC directory, if found [YES]?

                 If you answer NO to the question, you then need to
                 manually delete those files under SYS$SPECIFIC when
                 their names are in conflict with the files created by
                 this installation procedure. Appendix C lists the files
                 created by this installation procedure.

              7. System shutdown

                 The last question that the installation procedure asks
                 you is:

                                        Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX 3-5

 



        Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX
        3.1 The Installation Procedure

                 * Will you allow a system shutdown after this product is installed [YES]?

                 Note that before rebooting your system, you should make
                 sure that the command procedure SYS$STARTUP:HSY$STARTUP.COM
                 is executed during system reboot by either putting
                 that command procedure as a SYSMAN startup file, or by
                 adding the line:

                 $ @SYS$STARTUP:HSY$STARTUP.COM

                 to your site-specific startup command procedure
                 SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM. You are recommended
                 to use the latter method.

        3.1.3 Informational Messages

              At this point, the installation procedure displays a
              number of informational messages that report the progress
              of the installation (refer to the sample installation file
              in Appendix A for the text of the informational messages
              that OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX displays).

              There is no further question. If the installation
              procedure has been successful up to this point, VMSINSTAL
              procedure begins moving files to their target directories,
              updates the help files, and updates the system library and
              DCL tables. The following message is displayed:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories...

        3.1.4 Before completing Installation Procedure

              Before fully completing the installation, the installation
              procedure will run the Installation Verification Procedure
              to verify the OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX installation.

              %VMS/HANZI-I-BEGINIVP, beginning 7.2 IVP.

        3.1.5 Completing the Installation Procedure

              The following messages indicate that the entire installa-
              tion procedure is completed:

                Installation of HANZI V7.2 completed at 17:01

                VMSINSTAL procedure done at 17:07

              For descriptions of the error messages generated by
              those conditions, see the OpenVMS Documentation Set on
              system messages, recovery procedures and OpenVMS software
              installation. If you are notified that any of those
              conditions exists, you should take appropriate actions
              as described in the message.

                                                                       4
        ________________________________________________________________

                                      After Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX



              After you have installed the OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX operating
              system, you need to perform several important tasks to
              prepare the system for operation. This chapter describes
              these tasks in the following sections.

        4.1 Rebooting The System

              If you have chosen to reboot the system after installa-
              tion, which is the default, the installation procedure
              will automatically invoke the SHUTDOWN command procedure,
              and display the following message:

              %VMSINSTAL-I-SHUTDOWN, This product requires that the system be rebooted.

               SHUTDOWN -- Perform an Orderly System Shutdown
                           on node HANVMS

              If you choose to reboot at a later time, you can use the
              SHUTDOWN command procedure later as follows:

              $ @SYS$SYSTEM:SHUTDOWN

              However, please be reminded that the file SYS$STARTUP:HSY$STARTUP.COM
              must be executed at startup time. This can be done by one
              of the following procedures:

              Procedure A
                 By adding the following line to your site-specific VMS
                 startup procedure, SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM

                   $ @SYS$STARTUP:HSY$STARTUP.COM

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If you plan to install layered products with Chinese
                capability, for example, Asian Printing Support for
                OpenVMS, you should add this layered product startup

                                  After Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX 4-1

 



        After Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX
        4.1 Rebooting The System

                command procedure after the above line. Otherwise,
                the layered product would not startup properly.

                _____________________________________________________


              Procedure B
                 This can be done with SYSMAN as

                   $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSMAN
                   SYSMAN> STARTUP ADD FILE HSY$STARTUP.COM -
                   _SYSMAN> /PARAMETER=(P1,P2,P3,P4,P5,P6,P7,P8) -
                   _SYSMAN> /PHASE=LPBEGIN

        4.2 Running the Installation Verification Procedure

              Once the system is running again, you can invoke a command
              procedure to verify the OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX installation.

              $ @SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.VMS-HANZI]VMS-HANZI$IVP

              This Installation Verification Procedure will be invoked
              by the installation procedure of this version of OpenVMS
              /Hanzi VAX. Appendix B contains a sample log of the
              execution of the Installation Verification Procedure.

        4.3 Updating Individual Compilers Libraries

              Individual compilers have their own libraries. If
              you upgrade your system to OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Version
              7.2 without re-building the corresponding libraries
              for individual compilers, those libraries will not
              automatically reflect the latest contents of the STARLET
              library. Using new symbols introduced in the latest
              version of the STARLET library will result in compilation
              errors. Therefore, after the system is installed or
              upgraded to OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX, you are recommended to
              re-install or upgrade the compiler and choose to rebuild
              its library during installation.

              For example, Chinese SMG defines several new literals
              for supporting character sets in the STARLET library of
              the system, such as SMG$C_ASCII, SMG$C_SPEC_GRAPHICS
              and SMG$C_HANZI. Users can specify the character set
              parameter in any SMG routine calls with the new literals
              for processing Chinese characters in their application.

        4-2 After Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX

 



                                      After Installing OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX
                             4.3 Updating Individual Compilers Libraries

              Thus, you will have to re-install the compiler and rebuild
              its library. The program compilation will fail if the
              compiler library is not updated.

        4.4 Determining and Reporting Problems

              If you encounter a problem while using OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX
              Version 7.2, report it to Compaq. Depending on the nature
              of the problem and the type of support you have, you can
              take one of the following actions:

              o  Call Compaq if your software contract or warranty
                 agreement entitles you to telephone support.

              o  Submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

              Review the Software Product Description (SPD) and Warranty
              Addendum for an explanation of warranty. If you encounter
              a problem during the warranty period, report the problem
              as indicated above or follow alternative instructions
              provided by Compaq for reporting SPD non-conformance
              problems.

              If you find an error in the OpenVMS/Hanzi Documentation
              set, fill out and submit the Reader's Comments form to
              Compaq.

                    #===============================================================#
                     The file SYS$STARTUP:HSY$STARTUP.COM must be executed at
                     startup time.

                     This can be done with SYSMAN as
                     $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSMAN
                     SYSMAN> STARTUP ADD FILE HSY$STARTUP.COM -
                     _SYSMAN> /PARAMETER=(P1,P2,P3,P4,P5,P6,P7,P8) -
                     _SYSMAN> /PHASE=LPBEGIN

                     OR

                     By adding the following line in SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM
                     $ @SYS$STARTUP:HSY$STARTUP.COM

                     When the installation is completed, the procedure performs an
                     orderly shutdown of the system.  OpenVMS/Hanzi V7.2
                     will become available when the system is up again.

                    #===============================================================#

                  To complete the installation of this product, you should reboot
                  the system.  If it is not convenient to reboot at this time, then
                  enter NO to the following question.

                  If you enter NO, the installation procedure will continue.
