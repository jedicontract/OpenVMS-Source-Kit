          PRODUCT NAME:  OpenVMS/Hangul VAX Operating System,    SPD 25.G8.17
                         V7.2

          DESCRIPTION

          OpenVMS/Hangul VAX V7.2 is the Hangul (Korean) version of the Open-
          VMS V7.2 operating system. OpenVMS/ Hangul VAX extends OpenVMS VAX to
          provide an operating system environment to support Korean and ASCII
          characters on VAX series computers. On top of the basic functions of
          OpenVMS, OpenVMS/Hangul VAX extends and enhances the system utilities
          and environment to process Korean data.

          OpenVMS/Hangul VAX supports Korean data representation that conforms
          to the Korean Industrial Standard (KS C 5601-1987), Code for Infor-
          mation Interchange of the Republic of Korea.

          This SPD describes only the Korean specific features of OpenVMS/Hangul
          VAX which are extensions or additions to OpenVMS. For a description
          of the base functionality and supported environment of OpenVMS, please
          refer to OpenVMS Operating System for Alpha and VAX V7.2 SPD (SPD 25.01.xx).

          FEATURES

          OpenVMS/Hangul VAX provides the following Korean processing features
          in addition to the base functionality of OpenVMS.

          HTPU and HEVE

          HTPU is the Korean extended version of the DEC Text Processing Util-
          ity (DECTPU) providing built-in procedures with enhancement on Korean
          text processing. Additional Korean features are:

          o  Full form and half form character conversion

          o  Line drawing capability

          o  Symbol composition

          o  Korean character deletion and cursor movement

          o  Korean character wrapping

          o  Pattern matching including Korean characters

          HEVE is the Korean extended version of the Extensible Versatile Ed-
          itor (EVE) running on HTPU providing a general-purpose Korean screen
          editor to process Korean and ASCII characters. Extended commands which

          ter conversions on Hangul terminals which can only display the DOOSAN
          Character Set (DOOSAN 2-byte code). It allows these Hangul terminals
          to input and output Korean characters (Hanja is not supported) in the
          KS C 5601-1987 Character Set by converting characters going to and from
          the terminal. This character conversion is performed through a char-
          acter table transparent to application software.

          DEBUG Utility

          DEBUG utility is enhanced to support Korean characters on both char-
          acter cell terminal and graphic (DECwindows Motif) interface worksta-
          tion. Users can input Korean characters in DEBUG utility. The DEBUG
          utility is able to print and echo Korean characters in its output. In
          order to utilize DEBUG for Korean characters support, the locale files
          for Korean is required to be installed on OpenVMS/Hangul VAX V7.2 from
          the VMSI18N savesets. The VMSI18N savesets can be found in the Open-
          VMS distribution media and the locale file for Korean characters sup-
          port in OpenVMS/Hangul is "Korean". For more information, please refers
          to the OpenVMS/Hangul VAX V7.2 Release Notes and Installation Guides.

          itate development of Korean applications:

          Korean Processing (HSY$) Run-time Library

          OpenVMS/Hangul VAX provides a Korean Processing Run-Time Library for
          program and application development involving Korean processing. The
          Run-Time Library routines perform a variety of Korean processing func-
          tions such as string manipulation, read/write operations, character
          conversion and other Korean processing operations. These routines can
          be called from programs written in the VAX programming languages listed
          below.


          Korean Screen Management (SMG$) Run-time Library

          Korean SMG provides a set of run-time library routines to perform ter-
          minal independent functions on supported Korean terminals. Both Hangul
          and Hanja are supported in Korean SMG.
