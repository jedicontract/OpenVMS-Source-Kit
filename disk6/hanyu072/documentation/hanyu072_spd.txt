          PRODUCT NAME:  OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX Operating System,     SPD 25.G7.17
                         V7.2

          DESCRIPTION

          OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX V7.2 is the Hanyu (Chinese) version of the OpenVMS
          V7.2 operating system. OpenVMS/ Hanyu VAX extends OpenVMS VAX to pro-
          vide an operating system environment to support Chinese and ASCII char-
          acters on VAX series computers. On top of the basic functions of Open-
          VMS, OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX extends and enhances the system utilities and
          environment to process Chinese data. Utilities are provided to facil-
          itate the design and maintenance of user-defined characters. Output
          of user-defined characters is supported on DEC Hanyu terminals and print-
          ers via On-Demand Loading, a dynamic font loading feature.

          OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX supports Chinese data representation that conforms
          to the National Bureau of Standards CNS11643, the Standard Interchange
          Code for Generally-used Chinese Characters (SICGCC, 1986) of Taiwan.
          The EDPC Recommended Character Set defined by Electronic Data Process-
          ing Center of Executive Yuan of Taiwan is also supported as a stan-
          dard option.

          This SPD describes only the Chinese specific features of OpenVMS/Hanyu
          VAX which are extensions or additions to OpenVMS. For a description
          of the base functionality and supported environment of OpenVMS, please
          refer to OpenVMS Operating System for Alpha and VAX V7.2 SPD (SPD 25.01.xx).

          FEATURES

          OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX provides the following Chinese processing features
          in addition to the base functionality of OpenVMS.

          Collating value can also be associated with the user-defined charac-
          ters for sorting.

          HTPU and HEVE

          HTPU is the Chinese extended version of the DEC Text Processing Util-
          ity (DECTPU) providing built-in procedures with enhancement on Chi-
          nese text processing. Additional Chinese features are:

          o  Full form and half form character conversion

          o  Pattern matching including Chinese characters

          HEVE is the Chinese extended version of the Extensible Versatile Ed-
          itor (EVE) running on HTPU providing a general-purpose Chinese screen
          editor to process Chinese and ASCII characters. Extended commands which
          include features such as Chinese word manipulation, line drawing, box
          drawing and column editing capabilities are available.

          Phrase Input Utility

          The Phrase Input Utility facilitates creation and maintenance of user-
          defined database for frequently used phrases and input sequences for
          those phrases. Input of these phrases can then be done using the de-
          fined input sequence on supported terminals which provide this facil-
          ity.

          Terminal Fallback Facility

          The Terminal Fallback Facility (TFF) in OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX is extended
          to support character conversions on terminals which can only display
          the following character sets:

          o  MITAC Telex Code

          o  BIG 5

          It allows these terminals to input and output Chinese characters in
          the SICGCC (1986) Character Set by converting characters going to and
          from the terminal.

          DEBUG Utility

          DEBUG utility is enhanced to support Chinese characters on both char-
          acter cell terminal and graphic (DECwindows Motif) interface worksta-
          tion. Users can input Chinese characters in DEBUG utility. The DEBUG
          utility is able to print and echo Chinese characters in its output.
          In order to utilize DEBUG for Chinese characters support, the locale
          files for Chinese is required to be installed on OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX V7.2
          from the VMSI18N savesets. The VMSI18N savesets can be found in the
          OpenVMS distribution media and the locale file for Chinese characters
          support in OpenVMS/Hanyu is "Chinese". For more information, please
          refers to the OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX V7.2 Release Notes and Installation
          Guides.

          OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX provides a Chinese Processing Run-Time Library for
          program and application development involving Chinese processing. The
          Run-Time Library routines perform a variety of Chinese processing func-
          tions such as string manipulation, read/write operations, character
          conversion and other Chinese processing operations. These routines can
          be called from programs written in the VAX programming languages listed
          below.

          Chinese SMG provides a set of run-time library routines to perform ter-
          minal independent functions on supported Chinese terminals. Input and
          output of characters in the DEC Hanyu character set can be handled by
          calling these routines.

          Chinese Text Processing Utility (TPU$) Run-Time Library

          Chinese TPU provides a collection of built-in procedures and callable
          interfaces for Chinese and English text processing in character cell
          terminal or DECwindows Motif environments.
