Through electronic mail and document sharing across wide area networks,
users can collaborate on multimedia information that has been created
on desktop, departmental, and corporate systems. In addition, due to
Office Server's centralized server-based origins and comprehensive sys-
tem management facilities, a minimum management staff is required.


TeamLinks CLIENT SUPPORT

Services available to TeamLinks Windows V3.0, V4.0, V4.5 and Macin-
tosh V2.6.2 clients:

Office Server provides workgroup services to TeamLinks clients over
TCP/IP, SLIP, DECnet[TM], asynchronous links or AppleTalk[R] (to Mac-
intosh devices). The server enables TeamLinks users to gain access to
the File Cabinet drawers, folders and documents, messaging service,
distribution lists, and management functions with minimum retraining
for VT users familiar with ALL-IN-1 and MailWorks.

Users employing Windows and Macintosh desktops with their choice of
personal productivity applications available for these platforms can
transfer documents of any type (including multimedia documents) to the
Office Server File Cabinet for secure storage, and send these docu-
ments via the messaging service using existing distribution lists. In-
tegral distributed document sharing enables TeamLinks users to access
any type of document in remote Office Servers and ALL-IN-1 systems.

Office Server V5.0 allows users of heterogeneous clients (Windows, Mac-
intosh, VT) to coexist and fully participate in workgroup activities.

For full details of the facilities available from TeamLinks clients
please refer to SPDs 63.25 (Windows) and 48.17 (Macintosh).

Note: The level of client service can be extended beyond that offered
by the TeamLinks V4.0 Client. A full complement of Application Pro-
gramming Interfaces (APIs) is provided to the File Cabinet Server and
AIDA Server for application developers.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

MAPI CLIENT SUPPORT

Office Server provides messaging and collaboration services to Mes-
saging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) enabled applications
such as Outlook and Exchange via the Compaq Office Server MAPI Driver
V5.0 and V6.0 supplied separately. Mail, directory, file cabinet, group
management, drag and drop, and document conversion operations are sup-
ported on 32-bit Windows NT V4.0 workstations and Windows 98/95 PCs.
For full details of the functionality offered refer to SPD: 61.43.03
for V6.0 and 61.43.02 for V5.0.


WORLD WIDE WEB ACCESS

Users on the Internet or intranets can reply, forward, create and send
mail whilst accessing their own personal drawers, folders, messages
and documents - as well as any others to which they have been granted
access - with user logon and password authorization via the Compaq Of-
fice Server Web Interface V5.0 and V6.0 supplied separately. Utiliz-
ing standard Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator[R] and Microsoft
Internet Explorer from, for example, an Internet Café, messages and
documents can be viewed and downloaded to the PC.

In addition, any document placed in a drawer with World Read access
or Internet access can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet (sub-
ject to firewalls and any requisite tunneling software). No special-
ized Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) authoring tool is required on
the server to publish documents on the Internet, and updating docu-
ments is simply a question of filing a new document in the File Cab-
inet for immediate access from the Web. For further details refer to
SPD: 61.55.03 for V6.0 and 61.55.02 for V5.0.

Important: All documents within the Office Server File Cabinet can be
made secure by the inherent security capabilities. However, if these
facilities are not used correctly, access from Office Server to the
Internet may open up the possibility of security violations. Compaq
accepts no responsibility for the security of documents within Compaq
Office Server.

OFFICE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR CLIENT

The Administrator client can be installed on Intel[R] and Alpha based
Windows NT V4.0 workstations and Windows 98/95 Intel desktops. It pro-
vides the system manager a graphical user interface to various admin-
istrative tasks. Full VT based system management is also retained, en-
compassing all the management capabilities inherited from ALL-IN-1 V3.2.

The Administrator GUI provides management in the following areas:

o  User management

   -  Create account

   -  Modify account details

   -  Delete account

   -  Rename account

   -  Transfer user

o  Server management

   -  Manage File Cabinet servers

   -  Manage AIDA servers

   -  Configure servers for Failover and Load Balancing

   -  Manage senders and fetchers

o  Log management

o  Housekeeping

o  General system management

The Administrator client will attempt automatic reconnection to the
management server in the event of an automatic restart following server
failure.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

The Administrator Client is common to the full Office Server instal-
lation and the File Cabinet Only option (see below).

Note: The Administrator client requires IP transport and does not sup-
port any version of DECnet.


FILE CABINET ONLY OPTION

During the installation of Office Server V5.0 there is an option to
deactivate all local and external messaging to end-users. Customers
should choose this option if they are planning to standardize on al-
ternative messaging servers utilising client-server access, but still
require access to the Office Server File Cabinet with its repository
of historical information that could constitute millions of documents
and messages. System messages will continue to function.

End-users equipped with TeamLinks and MAPI Driver clients such as Out-
look and Exchange Client continue to have full access to the distributed
Office Server File Cabinet messages and documents. These clients must
use an alternate mail system such as Microsoft Exchange Server to pro-
cess their mail.

Note: Warning: If it is intended to continue running VT applications
and customizations created under ALL-IN-1, it is strongly recommended
that the File Cabinet Only option is not chosen as VT access and mes-
saging from VTs is discontinued with the selection of File Cabinet Only.

Note: Selection of the File Cabinet Only option mandates the adoption
of File Cabinet Client Access Licensing. See the Licensing and Order-
ing section later in this SPD.

Note: If the File Cabinet Only option is already activated within Of-
fice Server V4.0A it is not possible to revert back to full messag-
ing operation during the installation of V5.0, nor will V5.0 be li-
censed to support full operation.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

MESSAGING AND DIRECTORY SERVICES

Office Server is able to communicate with a variety of message trans-
fer agents (MTAs) and directory service agents (DSAs).


MAILbus 400

With the inclusion of the X/Open[TM] XAPI and XDS interface stubs, cus-
tomers may choose X.400 Alpha-based (either OpenVMS or Compaq Tru64
UNIX[TM]) MAILbus 400 and prerequisite Compaq X.500 Directory Service
Agents as their mail backbone, deploying MTAs and DSAs when and where
they wish, with local or remote connection to Office Servers.

The Message Router Migration Package V1.0 (QP-042) assists Message Router
(MR) customers to migrate from MR to MAILbus 400 by including the MAIL-
bus 400 Message Router Gateway (XMR) and MAILbus Directory Migration
Toolkit (DMT) as well as the MAILbus 400 MTA and DSA. This package caters
for the phased migration of up to thousands of users over an extended
period of time.

Note: The MAILbus Directory Migration Toolkit has not been tested for
Year 2000 Readiness so it is strongly recommended that operation of
DMT cease before Year 2000.

PMDF

Another option is Innosoft's PMDF, which delivers an AlphaServer based
smtp/MIME backbone, having direct access to Office Server's MRIF V2.0
interface, without the need for Message Router. PMDF can utilize a va-
riety of directory services, including its own Innosoft Distributed
Directory Server (IDDS) V4.4.1, as well as the Network profile, in-
tegral to Office Server. PMDF does not support Message Router's Dis-
tributed Directory Services (DDS).

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

LDAPv3

Office Server supports Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
V3, enabling the utilization of increasingly popular LDAPv3 directory
services. The implementation within Office Server V5.0 enables the use
of the VT client and integral Office Server management utilities to
populate the following LDAP directories:

o  Innosoft Distributed Directory Server (IDDS) V4.4.1

o  PMDF-X.500/LDAP Server (Note: this is to the LDAPv2 standard and
   is not Year 2000 compliant)

o  Netscape Directory Server V4.0

o  Netscape Directory Server V3.0 (Note: this is to the LDAPv2 stan-
   dard only)

Address lookups are also supported from TeamLinks, MAPI Driver clients,
Web Browsers, VT, and Office Server management utilities.

Message Router/MAILbus 1

Customers may continue with Message Router for OpenVMS VAX, as the MRIF
V2.0 interface is included. The Message Router OpenVMSmail Gateway al-
lows Office Server users to exchange messages with users of the Open-
VMS Personal Mail Utility. Refer to the Message Router for OpenVMS VAX
Software Product Description (SPD 26.33).

Note: Only Message Router V3.5 is Year 2000 ready.

Message interchange with the Internet and intranets is possible from
MAILbus 400, PMDF and Message Router. Internet style addressing is hon-
oured by Office Server out-of-the-box.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

IMAP4 SERVER

Internet Messaging Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4rev1) is supported as stan-
dard within Office Server V5.0. Users can access their INBOX or any
other folder from standard Internet mail clients such as Outlook Ex-
press and Netscape Communicator with user name and password authoriza-
tion. Upon connection, operations may be performed on documents and
messages in the File Cabinet such as creation, reading, refiling, at-
tribute modification, forwarding, replying and deleting. The processed
mail is transferred to a predefined smtp "sendmail" server such as Compaq
TCP/IP Services or MultiNet[R] for distribution. Note that Office Server
offers just two levels of nesting - Drawer and Folder.


POP3 SERVER

Post Office Protocol 3 is supported as standard within Office Server
V5.0. Users access their INBOX folder from standard Internet mail clients
such as Eudora and Netscape with user name and password authorization.
Upon connection, the contents of the Inbox are downloaded to the client
for offline processing. Upon reconnection, the processed mail is trans-
ferred to a predefined "sendmail" server such as Compaq TCP/IP Ser-
vices or MultiNet for distribution. The Office Server POP3 Server of-
fers a number of additional features including:

o  The ability to access any personal Office Server folder or shared
   drawer, and download the contents to the client.

o  Honours the "delete/retain message on server" option. The status
   of messages left on the server can be configured.

o  Conversion to text of WPS-PLUS (V4.2 and above) and WordPerfect[R]
   (V4.2 and above) messages and documents as they are transmitted to
   the client.

o  Available on both OpenVMS Alpha and VAX.

YEAR 2000 READY

This product is Year 2000 Ready.

"Year 2000 Ready" products are defined by Compaq as products capable
of accurately processing, providing, and/or receiving date data from,
into and between the twentieth and the twenty-first centuries, and the
years 1999 and 2000, including leap year calculations, when used in
accordance with the associated product documentation and provided that
all hardware, firmware and software used in combination with such prod-
ucts properly exchange accurate date data with the products.

For additional information visit the DIGITAL Brand area on Compaq's
Year 2000 Ready web site located at: http://www.compaq.com/year2000/

Office Server V5.0 stores dates in OpenVMS 64-bit format or NBS for-
mat and the supported date range is 17th November 1858 to 31st Decem-
ber 9999.

Years entered as two digits are defaulted to the century of the cur-
rent system date and stored as such. For example, a date string of 29-
Apr-74 processed on 5th March 1998 will be stored as 29-Apr-1974, and
on 5th March 2001 as 29-Apr-2074.

Date searches across the millennium change will behave correctly as
the complete date (and time) is stored.

DISTRIBUTED FILE CABINET

Distributed Sharing Option is included in Office Server as standard,
enabling users on remote systems to access documents in nominated draw-
ers and folders as if they were local to them.

As multimedia documents of all types become larger and distribution
lists longer, the ability to directly access information reduces the
load on the messaging system, leading to an overall performance im-
provement. Typically, groups of users would be notified of the exis-
tence of a document in a local folder by a small mail message, which
offers the individuals the choice of whether they wish to access it
or not.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

Users with appropriate privileges, administrators, and system managers
are able to set up access lists and controls, ensuring that only au-
thorized individuals and groups of users can gain access to documents
and messages within specifically-defined drawers and folders.

This capability is known within ALL-IN-1 as Distributed Sharing Op-
tion (SPD: 36.97).


MAILWORKS MIGRATION UTILITY

Office Server V5.0 includes server-based migration tools to assist in
the movement of MailWorks OpenVMS user data and the message store to
Office Server. Customers may install Office Server in situ on their
existing VAX and Alpha systems or on new Alpha systems and either copy
the message store to Office Server format, requiring more disk, or re-
name the message store without increase in disk usage. Copying the con-
tent ensures that the original MailWorks environment is left unchanged.

Note: It is strongly recommended that, as good management practice, a
full MailWorks system backup is taken before migration to Office Server.

The migration utility includes:

o  A pre-migration check tool that reports on data relevant to the mi-
   gration and any conflicts that might arise.

o  System manager-initiated migration of one or more users at the same
   time.

o  The migration of user profiles, file cabinets, and Personal Address
   Books

o  Preservation of the integrity of messages.

Full instructions on migrating from MailWorks OpenVMS were included
with the Office Server V4.0A Update kit and are included in the full
V5.0 kit.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

FILE CABINET/FILE CABINET MANAGEMENT

The Office Server File Cabinet is a full multimedia file repository.
Documents and messages of any type, such as HTML, Postscript[R], .DOC,
.XLS, .PPT, MPP, JPEG, full motion video, audio, ASCII and other for-
mats can all be stored in the File Cabinet.


Fault Tolerance and Load Balancing

The File Cabinet offers fault tolerance in that in the event of a File
Cabinet Server or AIDA Server failure, upon restart, automatic recon-
nection to TeamLinks V4.5 and MAPI clients will be attempted. Such MAPI
clients include Outlook and Exchange.

It is also possible to specify the maximum number of client connec-
tions to each FCS and AIDA Server thereby spreading the load across
multiple servers, multiple CPUs and multiple Nodes within a cluster.
In addition, specific clients may be automatically connected every time
to lightly loaded servers thereby ensuring very good response times
to specific users.

Management of these features is performed from the Administrator Client
and is not possible from a VT.

Established Features

The File Cabinet adopts the sharing model whereby a message sent to
multiple recipients on the local system is not copied to every recip-
ient, but pointers are utilized allowing each recipient to read the
one copy of the message. This offers two major advantages over the one
copy for each recipient model - better performance and much reduced
disk storage requirements.

The File Cabinet is similar in function to a standard office filing
cabinet with drawers containing documents contained within folders.
Folders are in alphabetical order and documents within the folders are
ordered by date and time of creation.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

Document information (such as title, date created, document number,
author, keywords, and type) is maintained in the File Cabinet. Facil-
ities are provided for the user to maintain and manage the contents
of the File Cabinet. The user can print or delete more than one doc-
ument at a time. Selection of the documents can be made with user-specified
criteria.

Documents (individual or by folder) can be refiled, cross-filed, or
duplicated. Information such as title and associated keywords can be
changed. When a document has multiple cross-filings within a single
drawer, only one copy of the document body is stored, thereby mini-
mizing storage space.

Documents deleted by a user are filed in the WASTEBASKET folder un-
til it is emptied.

The File Cabinet provides access to documents through a common mech-
anism, regardless of the format of the documents. Support is provided
as standard for document formats of virtually any type, including mul-
timedia. In addition, all X.400 P2 attributes can be stored in the Of-
fice Server File Cabinet.

Document reservation allows each user to protect a document while it
is undergoing a series of edits, in situ or remotely, preventing other
users from modifying it until unreserved. While it is reserved, other
users can read but not edit the document.

The document handling model makes a clear distinction between revis-
able and final form documents. The model provides clear separation of
formatting and printing, so that formatting of documents can be per-
formed separately from printing.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

Mail Janitor

A mail janitor utility is incorporated in the base product. It allows
the system manager to refile old messages from the READ and OUTBOX fold-
ers to the user's WASTEBASKET folder. The manager can set the maxi-
mum permitted age of messages in the READ and OUTBOX folders (default
60 days) and a maximum number of messages to delete per folder. Pro-
file and Policies options can set and override default actions for num-
ber of messages and user length of absence.

Management of the Mail Janitor facility is possible from the Admin-
istrator Client V5.0 as well as VT.

Checkmail

This feature is used to check if the user has any unread or unsent mail
in the default mail drawer before entering Office Server and will in-
form the user if this is the case.

Shared Filing

Users can create shared drawers to allow other users to read and edit
shared documents. Access controls are provided so that the drawer owner
can specify which users or named groups of users are allowed to ac-
cess a drawer and the operations they are allowed to perform in it.
Concurrence control ensures that certain actions are prohibited while
a user is modifying a shared document. For example, while a user is
editing a shared document, other users attempting to edit that doc-
ument will be informed the document is in use.

The Reservation feature enables users on clients such as Outlook, TeamLinks,
or VT to reserve a document in the File Cabinet before uploading the
document to the user's workstation, thereby indicating to all other
users who have access to that document that the document is in the pro-
cess of being modified. Anyone subsequently attempting to modify the
document is informed that it is reserved by another individual and that

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

only Read access is permitted. Only when the reserver returns the mod-
ified document and removes the reservation can others access the doc-
ument with more than Read access.


Group Services

Users with suitable profile settings can define a set of users as a
group. Multiple groups can be defined. Groups can be assigned access
privileges to shared documents or drawers. Members can be added to or
deleted from a group, and associated access rights are automatically
assigned or removed. Users can also check what groups they belong to.

MAIL

The following information is specific to Office Server VT client ac-
cess, describing the functionality available. Many of these operations
are accessible from TeamLinks and MAPI-enabled applications also. Please
check the relevant SPD for a complete list of each product's capabil-
ities. Messaging is not available to any user client or VT if the File
Cabinet Only installation option has been selected.

The Electronic Messaging application provides a means of exchanging
messages with other users. The user can create, edit, print, delete,
read, send, answer, and forward messages. The message header (which
contains addressee(s), subject, and mail classification) and the text
of the message can be edited prior to being dispatched.

When creating a message, the user specifies the addressee(s) to whom
the message is to be sent. Optionally, any addressee(s) to receive copies
or blind copies of the message may be included. In addition, users may
specify an expiry date for each message sent, along with importance
(low, normal, or high) and sensitivity (Not Sensitive, Company Con-
fidential, Private, or Personal). To save time with addressing, the
user can create personal distribution lists or nicknames (seen only
by the user).

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

Incoming messages can be forwarded, answered, or both. Answers can be
directed to the sender only, or to all the recipients of the message.
Senders can request confirmation that addressees have received the mes-
sage, read it, or both. Priority for delivery of the message can be
assigned as Express, First Class, or Second Class. The user can spec-
ify that the sending of a message be deferred to a time chosen by the
user.

Messages appear to the user and are treated as documents. Office Server
maintains folders for incoming, read, created, and sent messages. Once
a message is sent, one copy of that message (per system or cluster)
is shared by the sender and receiver(s) and cannot be edited. Messages
can be refiled and cross-filed in the user's File Cabinet. Documents
already in the File Cabinet can be sent to other users.

The user can choose to have all incoming messages automatically for-
warded to another user. Alternatively, the user can create a reply mes-
sage that is sent in response to all incoming mail (for example, "I
am out of the office until. . .").

Shared filing within Electronic Messaging ensures that operations be-
have correctly in shared and distributed environments. Mail operations
always take place in the user's MAIN drawer, whatever the previous con-
text.

An index of attachments to a message can be displayed and a set of op-
tions is provided for printing or reading individual attachments. At-
tachments can be filed as revisable text or as messages which can be
forwarded.

The Set Mail User (SMU) option allows a user to perform many mail op-
erations on behalf of another user, such as a secretary for a manager.
The Grant Mail Access (GMA) option lets users specify other users who
may process their mail. The mail header displays both users' names when
a mail message is sent by a user employing SMU.

Addressing includes:

o  Automatic recognition of Internet addresses

o  Integral X.400 addressing support

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

o  For backwards compatibility and minimum disruption for users, the
   continued support of Message Router style addressing, even when the
   mail backbone has been replaced with MAILbus 400

o  The ability to create a distribution list using the list of addresses
   from a received message header

o  Nickname support - long nicknames, manipulation of the long mail
   addresses common on messages sent or received via gateways to other
   mail systems, and the ability to create a nickname from the sender
   of a message

DIRECTORIES

The Directories subsystem provides access to, and maintenance of, di-
rectories available to the user. The user can view a directory of tele-
phone numbers and addresses which is maintained by the system manager.
A directory of all the Office Server users can also be viewed.

Facilities are provided for the user to maintain and view a personal
telephone directory, nicknames, and distribution lists.

With the adoption of MAILbus 400 as the mail backbone, directory ser-
vices are provided by Compaq X.500. Please refer to SPD 40.77.

With the installation of X.500 or MAILbus Distributed Directory Ser-
vice, Office Server provides the user with the ability to perform mail
directory searches on defined criteria such as name, department, lo-
cation, and organization.

See also the section on LDAP support above.

SYSTEM MANAGEMENT

The System Management utilities accessible from VT supplement the ca-
pabilities of the Administrator client GUI, and are used to perform
routine maintenance, including:

o  Scheduling and rescheduling of housekeeping procedures

o  Management of printers

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

o  Direct maintenance of NETWORK.DAT, X.500, LDAP, and DDS profiles

o  Metering and quota management of the shared area

A system manager can nominate a user as a system administrator to help
with the management of:

o  File Cabinet and AIDA servers in support of PC and Macintosh clients
   and other Office Server components

o  User accounts (create, delete, move, rename)

o  Mail system Sender/Fetcher processes and queue maintenance

o  Document archiving

o  System distribution lists

o  Drawers, including the restriction of individual user drawer cre-
   ation

o  Mail janitor functionality

o  Suppressing the printing of distribution lists

o  Scheduling housekeeping tasks

o  Monitoring Office Server exception and information reports

o  Initiating Office Server shutdown

Office Server administrators do not require OpenVMS system privileges.

Office Server supplies a metering facility that enables system man-
agers to collect data on resource usage within Office Server sessions
for pre-defined events. Application developers can define and create
their own additional meters. Meters record the number of times a me-
ter is called, CPU usage, Direct I/O, Buffered I/O, and Page Faults.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

PRINTING

The Printing facility provides users with the ability to specify where
a document is to be printed, the number of copies, and the output for-
mat. The output can be directed to any of the printers available to
the Office Server user, to another document, or to the user's termi-
nal. Printing and formatting is handled in the background, freeing the
terminal for other actions when interaction with the print formatter
is not needed.

Printer level checking ensures the print destination supports the doc-
ument's final form format.

Print and LPS print options (LPS20, LPS40, PS17, PS32) can be spec-
ified during a print operation. System-defined and user-defined print
styles can be utilized for improved ease-of-use.

Distribution List Print Suppression

Suppression of the distribution list on reading and/or printing of a
mail message is determined according to the user's current preferred
settings.

JOB SERVICES

Office Server provides users with the ability to perform operations
on their jobs on print, batch, and server queues. Using the multiple
select indexing capability, users can get information on jobs, delete
them, edit their attributes, and restart currently-executing jobs.

Management of queues and jobs can be performed within Office Server.
Managers can assign one or more users to manage specific local queues
and to requeue jobs to different queues.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

PROFILE

Each Office Server user has a user profile that contains information
pertaining to the user.

The VT user can access and modify part of their user profile includ-
ing full name, address, telephone number, department, and title. In
addition, user preference information (such as work week and working
hours, editing style, mail notification, and read receipt handling)
can be modified.

The Manager maintains information such as user privileges, default di-
rectory, and form library access.

INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT

Office Server is designed to support multilingual operations. When up-
grading from Office Server V4.0A primary and secondary language PAKs
must remain installed on the system. Secondary language PAKs must re-
main installed throughout the deployment of Office Server V5.0.

Multi-lingual support is subject to availability of the specific trans-
lation. Office Server can be deployed in a multilingual network and
can support multilingual operations on a single system. However, all
language kits, including U.S. English, must be the same version.

DOCUMENT PROCESSING

The Document Processing application enables VT and terminal emulation
users to create, edit, print, delete, and read documents. The editor
supplied with Office Server is EVE with EDT[TM] keys.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

DOCUMENT CONVERSION

Office Server includes the following supported data types:

o  Rich Text Format (RTF)

o  WK1, WK3, DIF, MacWrite[R], DX[TM], WPL, PICT, WordPerfect

o  PS - the final form PostScript document format

Office Server allows all the data types to be read, with the excep-
tion of PostScript. The CDA[TM] conversion function is used to con-
vert to/from the above data types.

Users can send and receive these document types in mail, store them
in their File Cabinet, read, print, copy, and convert them. The qual-
ity of formatting of the displayed data depends on the CDA facilities
provided by the underlying OpenVMS system. Office Server uses the CDA
character cell formatter, which gives improved results with correct
formatting and the inclusion of externally-referenced files.

Office Server attempts to print CDA documents in PostScript if the des-
tination printer is capable of it; otherwise, Office Server converts
the document to ASCII text before printing.

If a user attempts to edit any CDA document using a standard editor,
the normal handling results in a message telling the user that the doc-
ument format is not supported by the editor. However, the user can con-
vert a CDA document into a suitable format for editing, and then use
the appropriate editor. Through conversion, there is a potential for
formatting attributes to be lost.

For conversions on Alpha, DECwindows[TM] V1.2 must be installed and
the minimum version of CDA$ACCESS.EXE and DDIF$CC_VIEWSHR.EXE is V1.8.

For conversions on VAX, CDA Converter Library V2.2 must be installed,
which will also install CDA Run-Time Services V1.0. The minimum ver-
sion of CDA$ACCESS.EXE and DDIF$CC_VIEWSHR.EXE is V1.7.

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

LICENSING

Compaq Office Server V5.0 supports two mutually exclusive styles of
licensing:

o  For customers upgrading from Office Server V4.0 or V4.0A that are
   traditionally licensed due to their ALL-IN-1 heritage, Clusterwide,
   Capacity and User (Concurrent and Personal) licensing enforced by
   Product Authorization Keys (PAKs) continues to be supported, en-
   suring that customers experience no changes to the way they are cur-
   rently licensed, thereby eliminating any administrative overhead.
   ALL-IN-1 V3.2 will remain in the price book, and existing tradi-
   tional licenses will continue to be orderable.

o  For:

   -  new deployments of Office Server

   -  MailWorks customers migrating to Office Server

   -  selection of the File Cabinet Only option

   Client Access Licensing (CAL) is mandatory.

Client Access Licensing

Client Access Licensing (CAL) has the financial advantage of grant-
ing to one user the rights to access the Office Server system and Compaq
clients in the one license. For example, one CAL would enable a user
to access the Office Server capabilities from a Compaq TeamLinks, Compaq
MAPI Driver, Web Browser or VT client without incurring the cost of
the client software itself. If the client is developed by a third party
however, the rights to install that client on the desktop must be pur-
chased from the third party vendor, as the rights to third party soft-
ware are not granted by the Compaq Office Server CAL.

Without exception, one CAL must be acquired for every user featured
in the Office Server profile; that is, at all times every registered
user must be licensed by one CAL. CALs may be moved between systems
as user populations fluctuate, but the number of CALs present on the
site must equal or exceed the number of registered users at the site.

                                 29

 

Compaq Office Server for OpenVMS V5.0/SVENSKA        SPD: 70.09.02

Office Server V5.0 is licensed by two types of Client Access License
which cannot be mixed on one node. Customers that choose the full in-
stallation are licensed by the Office Server CAL with Unique Product
Identifier (UPI) of 5TD. Customers that install the File Cabinet Only
Option are licensed by the FCCAL with UPI of 5Z4.

Note: In OpenVMS clusters, traditional licensing and Client Access Li-
censing cannot coexist. For example, one Office Server system licensed
by CALs must not be added to an Office Server cluster licensed by Ca-
pacity or User licenses.

Full Office Server installations and File Cabinet Only installations
on separate nodes within a cluster are not allowed.

Office Server System License

In addition to CALs, each Office Server installation must be licensed
by one Office Server (system) License (UPI is 5TB) and the File Cab-
inet Only installation licensed by one Office Server File Cabinet sys-
tem license (UPI is 5Z2). For Office Server deployments on OpenVMS clus-
ters, one system license (QM-5TB9A-*A or QM-5Z29A-*A) is required per
OpenVMS system in the cluster.

Each Office Server kit (QB-5TBMA-SA) includes the license, media, and
documentation for Office Server, and the media, documentation, and li-
cense to install one Office Server Administrator client (UPI is 5TC).
Additional Administrator Clients may be installed upon the acquisi-
tion of additional licenses (QM-5TC9A-AA).

Each Office Server File Cabinet Only kit (QB-5Z2MA-SA) includes the
license, media and documentation for Office Server File Cabinet Only
and the media, documentation and license to install one Office Server
Administrator Client (UPI=5TC). Additional Administrator Clients may
be installed upon the acquisition of additional licenses (QM-5TC9A-
AA).
