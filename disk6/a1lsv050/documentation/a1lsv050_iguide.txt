                       1.2 Reading and Printing the Online Release Notes

        1.2 Reading and Printing the Online Release Notes

              Online release notes are provided with the language and
              market components of Office Server. The release notes
              contain information that was unavailable before the books
              went to print. It is recommended that you read the release
              notes, because they may contain information relating to
              the installation. You can access the release notes using
              the VMSINSTAL procedure before you install the Office
              Server software.

              There are two parts to the Office Server release notes:

              o  Release Notes Part 1 Language

                 This part contains the release notes specific to the
                 Office Server language being installed.

              o  Release Notes Part 2 Market

                 This part contains the release notes specific to your
                 Office Server market component. Note that this document
                 may not exist for all market components.

              To read or print the release notes, do the following:

              1. Log in to the privileged OpenVMS system manager's
                 account and enter the following command lines:

                 $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
                 $ @VMSINSTAL product device: OPTIONS N

                 where device is the device on which the media
                 containing the appropriate version of the release notes
                 is mounted and product is the product code. The product
                 codes are:

                 o  A1Llang050 for the Release Notes Part 1 Language,
                    where lang is the 2-letter code for the language you
                    are installing

                 o  A1Cmarket050 for the Release Notes Part 2 Market,
                    where market is the 2-letter code for the market
                    component you are installing

                 If you are performing an additional language instal-
                 lation, you need only print the Office Server Release
                 Notes Part 1 Language that is supplied with your kit.

     1.2 Reading and Printing the Online Release Notes

           When you have read or printed the release notes, terminate
           the installation procedure. If you have accessed only
           one part of the release notes, repeat the procedure to
           access the other part. The following files are placed in
           SYS$HELP:

           o  A1Llang050.RELEASE_NOTES, for the Release Notes Part
              1 Language, where lang is the 2-letter code for the
              language you are installing

           o  A1Cmarket050.RELEASE_NOTES, for the Release Notes Part
              2 Market, where market is the 2-letter code for the
              market component you are installing

     1.3 Checking Prerequisite and Optional Software

           Table 1-2 provides information about the prerequisite
           software for an Office Server installation. It also lists
           the software that is supplied with the Office Server kit,
           and optional software that you may want to install.

           The following definitions apply:

           o  Prerequisite means that the software must be installed
              before you install Office Server. The installation will
              fail if the prerequisite software is not installed.

           o  Optional means that the software is not required for
              the Office Server installation. Optional software
              provides additional functionality and the optional
              software that you install depends on the requirements
              at your site. For example, if you want to use Group
              Conferencing, you must install DEC Notes.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              Both the prerequisite software, and any optional
              software that you want to install, must be in-
              stalled, configured and running before you install
              Office Server.

        1.4 Licensing

              The way that your Office Server system is licensed
              depends on the whether you are migrating from ALL-IN-1
              or MailWorks, or are installing a new system:

              1. If you already have an ALL-IN-1 license, all appropri-
                 ate subsets for Office Server are enabled, and current
                 license Product Authorization Keys (PAKs) are honored.

                 If you are migrating from MailWorks, a Client Access
                 License must be acquired for every user of the system
                 as shown in Table 1-3.

                                   must purchase an additional Client
                                   Access License for each additional
                                   user.

                                   equal to the number of users
                                   supported during the migration.
                                   After migration to Office Server,
                                   you must purchase an additional

                                                           1.4 Licensing

        1.4.1 Registering License PAKs for Software Provided with
              Office Server Version 5.0

              You must register the License PAKS for additional products
              supplied with the Office Server Version 5.0 kit.

              The License PAKs for Message Router, Message Router
              gateway, and the CDA Converter Library can be registered
              automatically using the Office Server Version 5.0
              installation procedure

              The License PAKs supplied for these products are for VAX
              installations only, and are for any number of users. If
              you already have a license for one of these products, it
              will be replaced by the license supplied with the Office
              Server Version 5.0 kit.

              To register the License PAKs automatically, follow Steps 1
              to 5 in Table 2-2.

              Enter RL when the installation prompts you with the
              following question:

              * Which installation do you wish to perform [1]:

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Choosing the RL option does not start the installa-
                tion.

                _____________________________________________________

              The installation procedure checks your existing licenses,
              and if necessary registers and loads the appropriate
              licenses for the software products provided with the
              Office Server Version 5.0 kit. The installation then
              terminates.

              For prerequisite or optional products that are not
              supplied with Office Server, you must register the license
              PAKs manually using the License Management Facility (LMF).

     1.5 Example Order for Installing Optional Software

           After you have installed and configured the prerequisite
           software, install and configure the optional software
           products. See the appropriate product documentation for
           installation and configuration instructions.

           The following installation order is suggested for
           installing optional software before the Office Server
           Version 5.0 installation:

           1. Install ACMS

           2. Install VAX DATATRIEVE or DEC DATATRIEVE

           3. Install and configure your message transport and
              directory service software.

              o  For new or upgrade installations with Message
                 Router, make sure that Message Router is installed,
                 configured and running before you start the Office
                 Server installation. If you plan to use a remote
                 Message Router Directory Service, you must do a
                 customized Message Router configuration to enable
                 remote Directory Service access and configure
                 Message Router exception reporting for the Directory
                 Service and Transfer Service according to your
                 planning decisions.

              o  For new installations with DIGITAL X.500 and the
                 MAILbus 400 MTA make sure that you have installed
                 and configured all the required components on your
                 Office Server node or cluster. DIGITAL X.500 and
                 the MAILbus 400 MTA must be correctly installed,
                 configured and running before you start the new
                 Office Server installation. See the MAILbus 400 MTA
                 and DIGITAL X.500 Planning chapter in the Compaq
                 Office Server Planning and Setup Guide.

           4. Install and configure optional gateway products.

              o  The Message Router VMSmail Gateway if required with
                 Message Router.

              o  The MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway if required
                 with the MAILbus 400 MTA.

              5. Install DEC Notes.

        1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements

              This section describes the requirements for installing
              Office Server Version 5.0. It explains how to check the
              values and how to change them if necessary.

        1.6.1 Installing Account Requirements

              Use the SYSTEM account to install Office Server Version
              5.0.

              The installing account must have a valid rights identifier
              which is the same as the UIC for the account name. If you
              are using the SYSTEM account, the rights identifier must
              be the same as the UIC. To check the UIC and identifier
              values, do the following:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE
              UAF> SHOW/IDENTIFIER SYSTEM

              The value that is displayed is the UIC of the system
              account. To add the rights identifier, if it is not set
              up, do the following:

              UAF> ADD/IDENTIFIER SYSTEM/VALUE:UIC=[1,4]
              UAF> EXIT

              The installing account must also have sufficient quotas
              to enable you to perform the installation. Table 1-4
              summarizes the requirements.

              Note that these values are sufficient for installation,
              but they may not be appropriate for running Office Server.
              When you create new user accounts for Office Server
              Version 5.0 the process quotas are set to the appropriate
              values.

     1.6.2 System Parameters

           Table 1-5 lists the minimum required system parameter
           values for the installation. Depending on the kinds of
           programs and applications running at your site, you may
           need higher values for some settings. If necessary, modify
           the parameters to at least these values.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              You must check the OpenVMS system parameters on
              each node in the cluster on which you install Office
              Server Version 5.0.

              _____________________________________________________

           The values for the system parameters and quotas given in
           this section are those specific to Office Server Version
           5.0 and are acceptable for most systems.

           Dynamic system parameters are labelled with a (D) after
           them. You do not need to reboot your system after changing
           dynamic system parameters. If you need to set new values
           for other system parameters, you must reboot your system
           in order for the changes to take effect.

     1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements

              ________________________Note ________________________

              For the majority of installations, the values
              for CTLPAGES are sufficient. If you are planning
              to reboot your system to change other system
              parameters, you can increase the value to 200 for
              the duration of the installation.

              _____________________________________________________

     1.6.3 Displaying Current System Parameters

           Run the SYSGEN utility to display the current parameter
           settings:

           1. To display all the current system parameter settings,
              enter:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
              SYSGEN> SHOW /ALL

           2. To show each system parameter setting separately enter:

              SYSGEN> SHOW parameter

              where parameter is the parameter you want to examine.

           3. Press Ctrl/Z to leave SYSGEN.

           To check the number of free global pages and sections,
           enter the following commands:

           $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLPAGES")

           $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("FREE_GBLSECTS")

           If the value of free global pages or global sections is
           less than the value in Table 1-5 you must increase the
           system parameter setting. If the values displayed by the
           system are greater than the required values, you do not
           need to change the values for these parameters.

     1.6.4 Changing System Parameter Values

           Edit the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT to change the
           system parameter values. The entry that you make in this
           file depends on which of the parameters you are modifying.
           See Table 1-6.

              If you need to change and update non-dynamic system
              parameters, you must schedule time to reboot your system
              in order for the changes to take effect. The (D) after
              the system parameter value shows that they are dynamic
              parameters.

                               statements of the form:

                               parameter = parameter-value

                               where parameter is the name of the
                               parameter you want to change and
                               parameter-value is the setting you want
                               to change it to. See Table 1-5 for the
                               required value.

              __________________________________________________________

              CTLPAGES         Edit the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT to
              GBLPAGES         specify new values. Include a line of the
              GBLPAGFIL        following format for each parameter to be
              GBLSECTIONS      changed:

              LOCKIDTBL        ADD_parameter = increase-value

              MAXBUF (D)       where parameter is the name of the
              MAXPROCESSCNT    parameter you want to change, and
              RESHASHTBL       increase-value is the amount by which
              VIRTUALPAGECNT   you want to increase the setting of this
                               parameter.

                               For example, to increase the value of
                               LOCKIDTBL by 60, enter:

                               ADD_LOCKIDTBL=60

                                 1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements

        1.6.5 Disk Space on Your System Disk or Alternate Working
              Device

              This section discusses the disk space requirement for your
              kit working device during an Office Server Version 5.0
              installation.

              The default disk for your kit working device is your
              system disk. If your system disk does not have sufficient
              space, you can specify an alternate working device (AWD)
              when you start the installation.

              The disk space values for your kit are given in the
              documentation provided with your kit. You must check the
              disk space requirements on the target disks where Office
              Server Version 5.0 will be installed. See Section 1.6.7.

              You can run the installation in either safety or non-
              safety mode.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Compaq recommends that you run your installation in
                safety mode (the default).

                _____________________________________________________

              When you run the installation in safety mode, all of
              the Office Server Version 5.0 kit is restored onto the
              system disk or AWD before the files are copied to their
              target locations. This means that you need a disk space
              requirement greater than the total size of the Office
              Server Version 5.0 kit on your system disk. The disk space
              values for installing your kit in safety mode are given
              in Appendix C, or the documentation that is supplied with
              your kit, if not US or GB.

              If you do not have enough disk space to run the instal-
              lation in safety mode, you can run the installation
              in non-safety mode. In this case, each kit saveset is
              restored to the system disk before being copied to the
              target area. You need an amount of disk space on your
              system disk greater than the size of the largest saveset
              provided in the Office Server Version 5.0 kit. The disk
              space values for installing your kit in non-safety mode
              are given in Appendix C, or the documentation that is
              supplied with your kit, if not US or GB.

     Preparing Your System for Installation
     1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements

     1.6.6 Using the OA$LIB_SHARE Disk as the AWD

           If you have sufficient space on the target disk on which
           OA$LIB_SHARE will reside, Compaq recommends that you use
           this disk as the AWD. If you do have sufficient space to
           install on this target disk, the installation time can be
           reduced by approximately 20%. This is because the majority
           of the Office Server files reside in the OA$LIB_SHARE
           directory and therefore the installation procedure can
           move those files to their target directories by using a
           RENAME operation, rather than a COPY operation.

     1.6.7 Disk Space for Office Server Areas on Target Disks

           You can install Office Server Version 5.0 in the following
           ways:

           o  On a single target disk

           o  Across several target disks by installing Office Server
              areas on separate disks.

           For upgrade installations, the installation procedure
           assumes that the Office Server disks and top-level
           directories for the Office Server areas have not changed,
           and that the Office Server directory tree is the same. If
           you have moved any of the directories, you must put them
           back to their correct locations before upgrading.

           You can install more than one Office Server area on the
           same disk. If you do this, add the disk space values for
           the two areas together to find the total space required
           on that disk. See Compaq Office Server Planning and Setup
           Guide for more information about Office Server areas.

           The disk space requirements for Office Server language and
           market areas that you are installing are provided in the
           documentation supplied with your kit.

           To calculate the total disk space requirements for your
           installation, add together the disk space requirements
           given in this section and the requirements given in
           Appendix C, or the documentation that is supplied with
           your kit, if not US or GB.

                                 1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements

              The disk space requirements for each Office Server area
              are listed in the following tables:

              o  Table 1-7 for a new installation. See Section 1.6.9.

              o  Table 1-8 for an upgrade installation. See Section 1.6.10.

              o  Table 1-9 for the addition, upgrade or update of VAX or
                 Alpha architecture support. See Section 1.6.11.

                 These values can also be used for the addition, upgrade
                 or update of architecture support for an additional
                 language.

              You are prompted to specify the target disks for each
              Office Server area during the installation.

        1.6.8 Assigning Logical Names to Your Disks

              Compaq recommends that you assign logical names to your
              disks where possible.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                To avoid conflicts with system logical names, do not
                assign logical names that start with:

                o  A1$

                o  OA$

                o  OA1$

                _____________________________________________________

              In all types of installation, the installation procedure
              checks for conflicting system and process logical names,
              which could cause the installation to fail. You can check
              for conflicts before you start the installation. See
              Section 1.10 which describes how to run the Perform all
              preinstallation checks (PC) option.

              The logical name checking includes a check for any exist-
              ing logical names that start with OA$. An informational
              message lists the names found, and a warning message warns
              you that these logical names may be redefined.

     Preparing Your System for Installation
     1.6 Installation Procedure Requirements

           If a logical name conflict is found, an informational
           message is displayed. If the conflicting logical name is
           defined in a system table, you can remove the conflicting
           logical name from another process, and then repeat the
           check. If the conflicting logical name is specific to the
           installing process, then you must abort the installation
           to fix the problem and then restart it. The installation
           will not continue until the logical name checking has
           passed.

           For all upgrade or update installations, make sure that
           Office Server logical names do not point to system root
           directories; for example, OA$LIB_SHARE must not be defined
           as SYS$SYSROOT:[ALLIN1.LIB_SHARE].

           Do not use SYS$SYSDEVICE in directory specifications if
           you are installing on a mixed architecture cluster as the
           SYS$SYSDEVICE is different for each architecture.

     1.6.9 New Installation: Disk Space for Office Server Areas

           Table 1-7 gives the disk space requirements for installing
           Office Server areas on the system and target disks.

           The disk space requirements given are those used during
           the installation. The permanent space used when the
           installation has completed may be slightly less.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              If you do not choose to integrate WPS-PLUS during
              the installation, you can decrease the disk space
              in the shared library area by approximately 6000
              blocks.

              If you choose to integrate WPS-PLUS, but without
              the associated PostScript files, you can decrease
              the disk space in the shared library area by

        1.6.10 Upgrade Installation: Disk Space for Office Server Areas

              Table 1-8 gives the disk space requirements for upgrading
              Office Server areas on the system and target disks.

              The disk space requirements given are those used during
              the installation. The permanent space used when the
              installation has completed may be slightly less.

              The values given in the table assume that you choose to
              purge files during the installation. If you choose not
              to purge replaced files, you must use the values given in
              Table 1-7.

              If you do not choose to integrate WPS-PLUS during
              the installation, you can decrease the disk space in
              the shared library area by 5000 blocks.

              If you choose to integrate WPS-PLUS without the
              associated PostScript files, you can decrease
              the disk space in the shared library area by 2000
              blocks.

           If the images SYS$MESSAGE:FDVMSG.EXE and SYS$SHARE:FDVSHR.EXE
           are not installed, do the following:

           1. Edit the command procedure SYS$STARTUP:FMSTARTUP.COM to

           Install other images as follows:

           $ INSTALL
           INSTALL> CREATE imagename /OPEN /SHARED /HEADER_RES
           INSTALL> EXIT

     1.6.16 Checking The Location of DCLTABLES.EXE

           Check that DCLTABLES.EXE is in the directory SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB].
           If it is in a different directory, move it to this
           location before starting the installation.

           To check if DCLTABLES.EXE is in the correct location,
           enter:

           $ INSTALL
           INSTALL> LIST/FULL SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]DCLTABLES.EXE

           If it is not in the correct location, remove it:

           INSTALL> REMOVE DCLTABLES.EXE

           Move DCLTABLES.EXE to the correct location and then
           replace it:

           INSTALL> CREATE DCLTABLES.EXE /OPEN/SHARED/HEADER_RES

     1.7 Additional Tasks for Upgrade Installations

           If you are upgrading an existing Office Server system, do
           the following:

           1. Review your object libraries.

                          1.7 Additional Tasks for Upgrade Installations

                 Your object libraries may have been updated if you
                 installed layered products. Office Server provides two
                 template .OLB files in the following directories:

                 -  OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE:SITEOALIBR.OLB

                 -  OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV:SITEOALLV.OLB

                 During the installation, a warning is displayed if
                 there are additional .OBJ or .OLB files in these
                 directories. Check that any additional object libraries
                 or files in this directory are compatible with Office
                 Server Version 5.0. Remove any object libraries or
                 files that are not compatible. Although these files
                 are not used during the installation, they will cause
                 problems if you need to relink Office Server after the
                 installation.

              2. If you have a multilingual system, check that the files
                 OA$LLV*.EXE are not in SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]. If they
                 are, move them to the SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB] directory
                 before upgrading.

              3. Check that all files in your site areas have at least
                 system write access (S:W) and that Compaq Office Server
                 directories in non-site areas also have system delete
                 access (S:D).

              4. Make copies of customized data files. See Section 1.7.1.

        1.7.1 Copying Customized Data Files

              Office Server Version 5.0 uses modified versions of
              several data files:

              o  In the base area:

                 o  OAFC_SERVER_MASTER.DAT, the File Cabinet Server
                    master file

              o  Files which have not been converted but their records
                 have changed or new ones have been added:

                 o  CM$SDC

                 o  CM$CART$RUNS.DAT

                 o  SM_ACCOUNT_TYPES.DAT

     Preparing Your System for Installation
     1.7 Additional Tasks for Upgrade Installations

           Before upgrading, make copies of any data files that
           you have customized as new versions of data files are
           provided with Office Server Version 5.0. You must also
           return the data files to the Compaq standard format before
           you upgrade.

     1.8 Using the MAILbus 400 MTA and DIGITAL X.500

           You can install a new Office Server Version 5.0 system
           with the MAILbus 400 MTA and DIGITAL X.500. You cannot
           upgrade from ALL-IN-1 Version 3.1 using these products.

           For a new Office Server Version 5.0 installation, with
           DIGITAL X.500 and the MAILbus 400 MTA you must make sure
           that you have installed all the required MAILbus 400 MTA
           and DIGITAL X.500 components on your Office Server system,
           configured them and completed any additional setup tasks.
           See the checklist in the MAILbus 400 MTA and DIGITAL X.500
           Planning chapter in the Compaq Office Server Planning and
           Setup Guide.

     1.9 Using a Remote Message Router

           If you will be using a remote Message Router that is not
           in the same VMScluster, you must do the following:

           1. On the remote Message Router node, create an Office
              Server mailbox for the node (or cluster) on which you
              are installing Office Server. See Section 1.9.1.

           2. Create an entry for the remote Message Router node
              in the network nodes database on the local machine on
              which you are installing Office Server.

           3. Ensure that Message Router is running on the remote
              node before you start the installation. If it is not
              running, you will see errors when the installation
              procedure starts up the Sender and Fetcher processes.

                                       1.9 Using a Remote Message Router

        1.9.1 Create an Office Server Mailbox on the Remote Message
              Router Node

              Do this if you are planning to use a remote Message
              Router. If you do not create a mailbox before the
              installation, you will see problems when the installation
              procedure starts up the Sender and Fetcher processes.

              Message Router must be running and configured before you
              start the installation.

              If you are using a remote Message Router which is on a
              node in the same VMScluster as Office Server the Office
              Server mailbox name will be A1.

              If the remote Message Router is not in the same VMScluster,
              other Office Server systems may be sharing the same
              Message Router. The name of the Message Router mailbox
              must be unique for your system. For example, the mailbox
              name, mailboxname, could be localnodeA1 where localnode
              is the name of the node or the cluster on which you are
              installing Office Server. password is the password that
              you want to use for the Message Router mailbox. You are
              prompted for this password during the installation.

              On the Message Router node, do the following to create the
              Office Server mailbox:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:MRMAN
              MRM> ADD mailboxname /PASSWORD=password /COMPLETE_MESSAGES /IGNORE_SENDER _
                   /SERVICE_MESSAGES /SUPPRESS_DELIVERY_REPORTS
              MRM> EXIT

              Note that you must not use the /OWNER qualifier when
              setting up the mailbox.

        1.10 Running the Preinstallation System Check

              The Office Server Version 5.0 installation procedure
              provides a Perform all preinstallation checks (PC)
              option. Compaq recommends that you use this option before
              installing Office Server Version 5.0 to ensure that you
              have made all necessary system changes before installing
              the software.

     Preparing Your System for Installation
     1.10 Running the Preinstallation System Check

           You can use this option while an existing Office Server
           system is running so you do not have to ask your users to
           log out of the system.

           The option for preinstallation checks allows you to:

           o  Run the phase of the installation in which you answer
              questions and the installation procedure performs
              system checks

           o  Fix errors encountered by the installation procedure

           o  Exit without performing the installation

           Where possible the installation checks are done in an
           order which finds fatal errors first. Section 1.10.1
           describes the types of errors that are detected.
           Section 1.10.2 describes how to use the Perform all
           preinstallation checks (PC) option.

     1.10.1 Types of Errors Reported

           The following types of errors are detected:

           o  Fatal errors

              These are errors which cannot be corrected without
              stopping the installation procedure. Fatal errors
              include:

              -  Errors that require the machine to be rebooted

              -  Errors that require an upgrade to prerequisite
                 software, including OpenVMS, Message Router and the
                 Message Router VMSmail Gateway, or DIGITAL X.500,
                 the MAILbus 400 MTA and Message Router Gateway.

           o  Non-fatal errors

              These are errors that can be corrected from another
              process without stopping the installation procedure.
              Non-fatal errors include:

              -  Shareable images that are not installed

              -  Logical names that are not defined

              -  System parameters that can be changed dynamically

              -  Prerequisite software files that are missing

               Option

              To run the Perform all preinstallation checks (PC) option,
              follow Steps 1 to 6 in Table 2-2 until you are prompted
              with a list of installation options.

              If you are migrating from MailWorks, the MailWorks
              migration tool is installed as part of the installation
              desribed in Table 2-2.

              Do the following:

              1. Press Return to choose the default option.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Choosing this option does not install the software.

                _____________________________________________________

                 The following message is displayed:

                   The installation procedure allows you to perform the following actions:

                   (I)   Perform the installation
                   (PC)  Perform all preinstallation checks

                 * Which action do you wish to perform [I]:

              2. Choose the Perform all preinstallation checks (PC)
                 option by entering: PC.

              3. If a check fails with an error that can be corrected
                 without stopping the installation procedure, you
                 are asked if you want to correct the error before
                 continuing.

                 If you answer yes, the installation checking procedure
                 pauses so that you can fix the error from another
                 process. When the error is fixed, you can resume the
                 procedure, and the check is repeated.

                 If you choose not to correct the error, you have
                 the option of halting the procedure or continuing
                 to perform the remaining checks. If you choose to
                 continue, the installation procedure will terminate
                 when all the checks are performed.

     1.11 Final System Preparation Tasks: New Installations

           To prepare your system for a new Office Server Version 5.0
           installation, do the following:

           1. Check that all prerequisite software is installed,
              configured and running.

           2. Start the queue manager, if necessary.

           3. Back up the system disk and any target disks. See
              Section 1.13.

     1.12 Final System Preparation Tasks: Upgrade Installations

           For an upgrade installation from Office Server Version
           4.0, carry out the following steps before starting the
           installation. Each step is described in the following
           sections.

           From the privileged SYSTEM account, do the following:

           1. Shut down Office Server. See Section 1.12.1.

           2. Ensure that Message Router is running and is correctly
              configured.

           3. Deinstall files in the site areas that are installed in
              memory. See Section 1.12.2.

           4. Start the queue manager, if necessary.

           5. Back up the system disk and any target disks. See
              Section 1.13.

     1.12.1 Shut Down Office Server

           Ask users currently on the system to log out, and then
           shut down Office Server.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              Office Server must not be used by any batch jobs or
              users during the installation, or the installation
              will fail.

             1.12 Final System Preparation Tasks: Upgrade Installations

              Do not allow anyone to log in again while the installation
              is in progress. You can allow OpenVMS users to remain on
              the system, but it is important to ensure that users do
              not use DCL HELP while the installation is in progress,
              as this can cause file locking problems when the DCL HELP
              library is updated during the installation. If possible,
              it is safer to ensure that there are no active users on
              the system.

        1.12.2 Deinstall Files Installed in Memory

              If you have any files in the site areas that are installed
              in memory, for example, SITE$OA.A1$SECTION, deinstall
              them on all nodes in the cluster before you start the
              installation. Deinstalling files from memory will prevent
              them from being write locked. The installation sets an
              ACL on all files in the site areas so you must ensure that
              all files in the site area have system write access (S:W).
              Make sure that you deinstall any of your own code-level
              executable images that are installed in memory.

        1.13 Back Up Your System and Target Disks

              Compaq recommends that you do a system disk backup before
              installing any software because:

              o  If a system failure occurs at a critical point during
                 installation, your Office Server system could be left
                 in an inconsistent state.

              o  You can verify that the backup copy contains a working
                 system image and then replace the system disk with it.

              o  There is more contiguous free space, which may be
                 needed for installation.

              If you are going to install Office Server Version 5.0 on
              more than one disk, back up the target disks that you will
              be using.

              Use the backup procedures that are established at your
              site. For details on performing a system disk backup, see
              the section on the Backup Utility in the OpenVMS System
              Management Subkit.

              At the beginning of the installation, VMSINSTAL asks if
              you have backed up your system disk.

           Installation Procedure: New, Upgrade and Architecture Support



              This chapter describes the procedures for installing
              the Office Server Version 5.0 base, language and market
              components. The following installation examples are given:

              o  A new installation of Office Server Version 5.0 on
                 an Alpha system with the MAILbus 400 MTA and DIGITAL
                 X.500. See Section 2.1.

              o  Upgrade installation of Office Server Version 4.0 to
                 Office Server Version 5.0 with Message Router and the
                 Message Router Directory Service. The installation
                 is done on the Alpha system in a mixed-architecture
                 VMScluster, where Message Router is installed on a
                 remote VAX node. See Section 2.1.

              o  Addition or upgrade of additional architecture support
                 on a mixed-architecture VMScluster. See Section 2.2.

                __________________Before  You Start __________________

                Do not start the installation until you have done
                the following:

                1. Planned your installation by reading the Compaq
                   Office Server Planning and Setup Guide.

                2. Completed the system preparation tasks in
                   Chapter 1 to check that your system is ready for
                   the installation.

        2.1 Installation Procedure for New and Upgrade Installations

              Table 2-2 lists all the installation steps for a new or
              upgrade installation. The example scripts in the table
              show extracts from a new installation on an Alpha system
              using the MAILbus 400 MTA and DIGITAL X.500 and an upgrade
              installation from Office Server Version 4.0 with Message
              Router.

     Step__Action____________________________________________________

     1     Create a log file for the installation. Compaq recommends
           that you keep a record of the installation in case of
           problems. You can keep a log by using either a hard copy
           terminal or a log file. To keep a record in a log file,
           enter:

           $  SET HOST 0/LOG=filename

           where filename is the name of the log file. The log file
           is created in the directory where you enter the command.
           If you do not specify a filename, the file is called
           SETHOST.LOG. The installation log file will be about 200
           blocks.

           If you are running console management software, you can
           use this to record the installation. See your console
           management documentation for further information.

     ________________________________________________________________

     2     Load and mount the CD that contains the software kit.

     ________________________________________________________________

     3     Invoke the VMSINSTAL procedure from the SYSTEM account.

           Enter the following commands:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
           $ @VMSINSTAL A1050 device

           To use an alternate working device (AWD), enter the
           following command lines:

           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
           $ @VMSINSTAL A1050 device OPTIONS AWD=disk

           device is the device on which you have mounted the
           distribution media. You can use a physical or a logical
           device name but do not use logical device names beginning
           with A1$, OA$, or OA1$. A1050 is the product identifier
           and disk is the location of the alternate working device.

           X.500: Confirm that you want to use the MAILbus 400 MTA
           for remote mail.

             If you plan to use MAILbus 400 as your MTA, then answer YES to this

             question. You will not have been offered this choice unless the

             installation checks have revealed that the product is installed.

             Note that even though MAILbus 400 appears to be installed and initially

             configured, it is unlikely that it will successfully process your mail

             until you have completed all the set up tasks described in the Planning

             and Setup Guide.

             If you answer NO to this question, Office Server users will only be able

             to exchange messages locally, unless you subsequently choose to use

             Message Router (if it is available.)

           * Do you want to use MAILbus 400 for remote mail [YES]?

           Press RETURN to use the MAILbus 400 MTA for remote mail.

           It does not make any difference to the installation if the
           MAILbus 400 MTA is installed on the same node as Office
           Server or on a different node in the same VMScluster on a
           remote node outside the cluster, providing that you have

        Step__Action____________________________________________________

        23    Upgrade_Installation: Confirm that you want to use Message
              Router for remote mail.

              Office Server on a VAX node can be configured to use
              a local Message Router which is installed on the same
              node or a remote Message Router which is installed on a
              different node. Office Server on an Alpha node can only
              use a remote Message Router. This example script is on
              an Alpha system so it must be configured to use a remote
              Message Router.

              * Do you want Office Server to be configured to use Message Router [YES]?

              Answer Y to confirm that you want to use Message Router.

        ________________________________________________________________

        24    Upgrade_Installation: If Message Router is not installed
              on this node, confirm that you want to use a remote
              Message Router.

              * Do you want to use a remote Message Router [YES]?

              Enter Y to confirm that you want to use a remote Message
              Router.

              Note that the default value for this answer depends on
              whether you are doing the upgrade installation on a VAX
              system or an Alpha system. In this example, the upgrade
              is on an Alpha system, so the default is to use a remote
              Message Router.

           Note that the remote Message Router node must be in
           the network nodes database on the node on which you
           are installing Office Server. As this is an upgrade you
           will not be asked for a password for the Message Router
           mailbox.

           Additional_Questions

           If you are installing a new Office Server system with
           Message Router, you are prompted to enter a password for
           the Message Router mailbox.

           * Enter a password for the Message Router mailbox:
           * Please confirm the password that you specified:

           The password must be a minimum of 8 characters and a
           maximum of 32 characters. Confirm the password.

              gave during the new or upgrade installation. For example,
              if you did not install WPS-PLUS during the new or upgrade
              installation, you are not asked any additional questions
              about WPS-PLUS.

     Installation Procedure: New, Upgrade and Architecture Support
     2.2 Adding or Upgrading Architecture Support

     2.2.1 Before You Start

           Before you start the installation, you must do the
           following:

           1. If you are installing architecture support for the
              first time, make a note of the location of the Office
              Server configuration file, OA$DATA_SHARE:A1CONFIG.DAT,
              on the system where you have already installed a new
              Office Server Version 5.0 system or upgraded to an
              Office Server Version 5.0 system. You will be asked for
              this information during the installation.

           2. Run the script, OA$LIB:SM_CHECK_SYS$SYSDEVICE.SCP, to
              check for logicals containing SYS$SYSDEVICE.

           3. From the Office Server manager's account on the node
              where Office Server is already installed, run the
              script, OA$LIB:SM_CHECK_SYS$SYSDEVICE.SCP:

              $ SET HOST 0/LOG=filename
              $ OFFICESERVER/NOINIT
              Enter CMD: DO OA$LIB:SM_CHECK_SYS$SYSDEVICE.SCP

              If references to SYS$DEVICE are found, a warning
              message is displayed. You must remove the references
              as they will refer to different devices on a VAX
              system and an Alpha system. If the references are not
              corrected, data may be lost on your system.

              The installation procedure also runs this script.

     2.2.2 Installation Procedure for Adding Architecture Support

           Table 2-4 shows an example script for an additional-
           architecture installation on a VAX system. The following
           information is used:

           o  Office Server Version 5.0 is already installed on an
              Alpha system in the same VMScluster.

           o  WPS-PLUS is installed on the Alpha system.

           o  Office Server has been configured as a multilanguage
              system on the Alpha system.

           o  Message Router is installed on this VAX system.

                            Installation Procedure: Additional Languages



              This chapter describes the installation of an additional
              language on an Office Server Version 5.0 system that is
              configured as a multilanguage system.

                __________________Before  You Start __________________

                Do not start the installation until you have
                completed the system preparation tasks in Chapter 1.

                _____________________________________________________

              During the installation procedure a number of cautions and
              general informational messages are displayed. Read all the
              displayed messages carefully.

              Each question in the installation is marked with an
              asterisk (*) at the beginning of the line. If you are
              unsure how to answer a question enter a question mark (?)
              for Help.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                If the installation fails, you must restart the
                installation from the beginning. To stop the
                installation at any point, press CTRL/Y.

                _____________________________________________________

              If you are installing a new additional language or upgrad-
              ing an existing additional language, see Section 3.1.

              If you are installing or upgrading architecture support
              for an additional language, see Section 3.2.

           Follow the steps in Table 3-1 to install a new additional
           language or upgrade an existing additional language.

           There are minor differences in the display depending on
           whether the installation is being run on a VAX or Alpha
           system.

           The example script shows the addition of BRITISH as an
           additional language on an Office Server Version 5.0 Alpha
           system that is configured as a multilanguage system.

        Table_3-1_Installation_Procedure_for_An_Additional_Language_____

        Step__Action____________________________________________________

        1     Create a log file for the installation. Compaq recommends
              that you keep a record of the installation in case of
              problems. You can keep a log by using either a hard copy
              terminal or a log file. To keep a record in a log file,
              enter:

              $  SET HOST 0/LOG=filename

              where filename is the name of the log file. The log file
              is created in the directory where you enter the command.
              If you do not specify a filename, the file is called
              SETHOST.LOG. The installation log file will be about 200
              blocks.

              If you are running console management software, you can
              use this to record the installation. See your console
              management documentation for further information.

        ________________________________________________________________

        2     Load and mount the CD that contains the language software
              kit.

        ________________________________________________________________

        3     Invoke the VMSINSTAL procedure from the SYSTEM account.

              Enter the following commands:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
              $ @VMSINSTAL A1LUS050 device

              To use an alternate working device (AWD), enter the
              following command lines:

              $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
              $ @VMSINSTAL A1LUS050 device OPTIONS AWD=disk

              device is the device on which you have mounted the CD.
              You can use a physical or a logical device name but do
              not use logical device names beginning with A1$, OA$, or
              OA1$. A1LUS050 is the product identifier and disk is the
              location of the alternate working device.

              Enter CMD: DO OA$LIB:SM_CHECK_SYS$SYSDEVICE.SCP

              If references to SYS$DEVICE are found, a warning message
              is displayed. You must remove the references as they will
              refer to different devices on a VAX system and an Alpha
              system. If the references are not corrected, data may be
              lost on your system.

              Follow the steps in Table 3-2 to add architecture support
              for an additional language that you have already installed
              on a different architecture in the same VMScluster. The
              example script shows the addition of VAX architecture
              support for Office Server BRITISH as an additional
              language. BRITISH is already installed as an additional
              language on an Alpha system in the same VMScluster.

                                         Installation Errors and Failure



              This chapter deals with various error messages you may see
              while installing Office Server Version 5.0 or while the
              Installation Verification Procedures (IVPs) are running,
              and explains what to do if the installation or the IVPs
              fail.

              While the installation is running it displays various
              informational messages. It may also display warning or
              error messages. Read all the messages displayed, and take
              whatever action they advise.

        4.1 Common Errors

              Errors can occur during the installation if any of the
              following conditions exist:

              o  There is a problem with the operating system.

              o  There is a problem with prerequisite software.

              o  Quotas necessary for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  System parameter values for successful installation are
                 insufficient.

              o  The OpenVMS help library is currently in use.

              o  SYS$LIBRARY:IMAGELIB.OLB and SYS$LIBRARY:STARLET.OLB
                 are not present. These files are removed if you tailor
                 OpenVMS.

              For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
              conditions, see the OpenVMS books on system messages,
              recovery procedures, and OpenVMS software installation.
              If you are notified that any of these conditions exist,
              you should take the appropriate action as described in the
              message.

     4.2 Failure During Postinstallation


     4.2 Failure During Postinstallation

              ________________________Note ________________________

              When the installation procedure reaches the
              postinstallation phase, the main installation
              has completed. If the postinstallation tasks
              fail, a message is displayed indicating that
              the installation has failed and that you need to
              reinstall Office Server. It is not necessary to
              do this; you need only rerun A1$POSTINSTALL.COM as
              described in this section.

              You must rerun A1$POSTINSTALL.COM on the node on
              which you originally ran the installation.

              _____________________________________________________

     4.2.1 Failure of Upgrade Installations in Safety Mode

           If your installation is being performed in Safety mode,
           you need take no further action if the failure happens
           before the message:

           Files will now be moved to target directories

           If the installation fails after this message, restore
           your original system from a backup. You can then go
           back to using the original system, or you can start the
           installation again.

     4.2.2 Failure of Upgrade Installations in Non-Safety Mode

           If your installation is being performed in non-safety
           mode, restore your original system from a backup. You
           can then go back to using the original system, or you can
           start the installation again.

     4.2.3 Full Installations

           If a full installation fails, delete all accounts,
           identifiers and directories that have been created, and
           start the installation again.

        4.2.4 Failure Due to Insufficient Dynamic Memory

              An installation on an Alpha system may fail with the
              following error message:

              %SYSTEM-F-INSFMEM, insufficient dynamic memory

              If this error occurs, you must check that the value for
              CTLPAGES is high enough. If you used the default value
              of 100, you must increase it to 200 and restart the
              installation. See Section 1.6.2.

        4.3 Error Messages when Running the IVP

              The following informational and error messages are
              displayed when the IVP is run:

              %OA-I-LNF, Error opening form library "THIS_IS_A_TEST"
              -RMS-E-FNF, file not found

              %OA-W-INVGET, Symbol "THIS_IS_A_TEST" not found

              %OA-E-BADLIB, Error occurred while precompiling THIS_IS_A.TEST
              form library

              You can ignore these messages as they are part of tests
              that are performed by the IVP.

              If any other error messages occur during the IVP, do the
              following:

              1. Check the log of the installation for any errors that
                 may have occurred during installation.

              2. Check the file ALLIN1_IVP.LOG. This file does not
                 contain the results of the IVP, but the results of
                 invoking Office Server when running the IVP. This file
                 is in the directory where you run the installation.

              3. Check for any errors in the following procedures.

                 o  During the execution of the startup file,
                    SYS$STARTUP:A1V50START.COM:

                       Creating logical names

                 o  Automatic postinstallation procedures

     4.3 Error Messages when Running the IVP


           4. Make sure that the Office Server TXL is compiled
              and installed successfully, and recompile it if you
              received any error messages when the postinstallation
              command file was run.

           5. Check that you have not run out of quota on the disk or
              disks containing the OA$SHAREnnnn directories (refer to
              the manual describing OpenVMS utilities).

           6. Check that the details for the IVP account are
              completed correctly, as follows:

              o  All the Office Server privileges are set to YES.

              o  The IVP user directory points to the disk and sub-
                 directory that you specified for the Office Server
                 manager's account. For example:

                 a1device:[OFFICE.IVPUSER]

                 where a1device is the device that you specified
                 during the installation.

              o  The Office Server account, IVP, is accessed from the
                 Office Server manager's OpenVMS account.

           7. Run Office Server and try to use those areas that
              failed during the IVP to find more information on the
              error.

              Log in to the Office Server manager's IVP account:

              $ OFFICE /USERNAME=IVP

              Manually execute each IVP test as described in DIGITAL
              Office Server Managing from a VT Terminal (the V4.0
              book).

              ________________________Note ________________________

              The IVP runs in the language context of the current
              optional language being installed and also tests the
              international base system.

              Most IVPs are designed to exercise and test Office
              Server at a level which is normally customization-
              independent. However, if you have customized the
              Phone Directory subsystem of Office Server, the
              display graphics (IDG) procedure may fail. This is

              This chapter describes the tasks that you must do to
              complete the setup of Office Server. Some of these
              tasks are optional, or only apply to particular types
              of systems, or configurations.

              There are a number of additional setup tasks that the
              Office Server manager must do to set up the users' working
              environment before Office Server is used. These tasks are
              explained in detail in the DIGITAL Office Server Managing
              from a VT Terminal (the V4.0 book)

              You must run postinstallation from the node on which you
              are running Office Server.

        5.2 Start Office Server on all Nodes in a VMScluster System

              The Office Server startup procedure, SYS$STARTUP:A1V50START.COM,
              is supplied with Office Server and is executed automat-
              ically on the node used for the installation, once the
              installation has completed successfully.

              If you are running Office Server on a VMScluster you
              must also run SYS$STARTUP:A1V50START.COM on each node
              in the cluster in order to start Office Server. If you
              run A1V50START.COM manually from the DCL prompt, you must
              include the location of the Office Server configuration
              file, OA$DATA_SHARE:A1CONFIG.DAT. OpenVMS prompts you for
              the location of this file if you do not specify it on the
              command line.

              If you are creating new shared directories from within
              Office Server, you must define new system logical names on
              each node in the cluster. For further information about
              running Office Server on a VMScluster, see the DIGITAL
              Office Server Managing from a VT Terminal (the V4.0 book).

     5.3 Create or Modify the Site-specific Office Server Startup Procedure


     5.3 Create or Modify the Site-specific Office Server Startup
         Procedure

           To modify the Office Server startup command procedure, you
           must create a site-specific command procedure. The site-
           specific startup command procedure will be automatically
           executed by the Office Server startup command procedure
           when it is executed.

           You can create the following types of site-specific
           command procedure:

           o  A language-independent startup command procedure called
              A1V50_SITE_START.COM. Create this startup procedure in
              OA$SITE_BUILD_SHARE_IND.

           o  A language-specific startup command procedure, OA$SITE_
              language_START.COM, for each language installed in a
              multilanguage Office Server system. Create this startup
              procedure in OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_IND.

              device:[directory.SITE.SOURCES_language])

              where: device is the device containing the language
              files, and directory is the name of the top-level
              directory of your Office Server Version 5.0 system.

              You can specify the directory for your default language
              by using the logical name OA$SITE_BUILD_LLV_IND.

           If you are upgrading and you have a site-specific startup
           command procedure that you want to keep, rename it from
           A1V32_SITE_START.COM to A1V50_SITE_START.COM.

     5.4 Edit the Site-specific Startup Procedure

           When you run A1V50START.COM from the DCL prompt, you must
           include the location of the Office Server configuration
           file, OA$DATA_SHARE:A1CONFIG.DAT. OpenVMS prompts you for
           the location of this file if you do not specify it on the
           command line. When you include the Office Server startup
           procedure in the OpenVMS site startup procedure, you must
           specify the location of the A1CONFIG.DAT file:

           $ @SYS$STARTUP:A1V50START.COM location

                            5.4 Edit the Site-specific Startup Procedure


              where location is the location of A1CONFIG.DAT, which is
              specified as:

              device:[directory.DATA_SHARE]

              device is the device that you specified for the Office
              Server data files and directory is the top-level directory
              that you specified for the Office Server data files.

              To find the location of OA$DATA_SHARE:A1CONFIG.DAT, refer
              to your installation log.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                However you choose to set up your site-specific
                startup procedures, you must ensure that all the
                Office Server prerequisite products are started
                before Office Server. This includes messaging
                software, DEC Notes, and DECwindows/Motif if you
                are using CDA converters with Office Server.

        5.4.1 Installations With DIGITAL X.500 and the MAILbus 400 MTA

              If you have installed a new Office Server system with
              DIGITAL X.500 and the MAILbus 400 MTA, you must ensure
              that the prerequisite messaging products are started
              before Office Server. Make sure that the following 3 files
              are executed in the following order:

              1. SYS$STARTUP:OSAK$START.COM

              2. SYS$STARTUP:DXD$COMMON_STARTUP.COM

              3. SYS$STARTUP:MTA$COMMON_STARTUP.COM

        5.4.2 Installations with Message Router

              For Office Server systems using Message Router, you must
              ensure that the Message Router software is started before
              Office Server.

              As an example, Table 5-2 describes how to edit the OpenVMS
              site-specific startup file to include the Office Server
              startup procedure after an upgrade installation from
              ALL-IN-1 Version 3.2. This ensures that the Office Server
              environment is reestablished following a system reboot.

        5.5 Replace the DCLTABLES on Cluster Systems

              If you installed Office Server Version 5.0 on a VMScluster
              system, you must replace the DCLTABLES on any nodes in the
              cluster where you are not installing Office Server Version
              5.0. Enter the following commands on each of these nodes:

              $ INSTALL
              INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$SHARE:DCLTABLES /OPEN /SHARE -
              _INSTALL> /HEADER_RES
              INSTALL> EXIT

              You need only do this once after you have installed
              Office Server Version 5.0. The Office Server installation
              procedure replaces the tables automatically for the node
              on which you are installing Office Server Version 5.0.

        5.6 Delete Files That Are No Longer Required

              If you have upgraded or updated Office Server, various
              files remain in the SYSTEM directories which you can
              delete to increase your disk space. The files are:

              o  For an Office Server Version 4.0 upgrade:

                    SYS$HELP:A1040.RELEASE_NOTES or
                    SYS$HELP:A1Llang040.RELEASE_NOTES
                    SYS$HELP:A1Cmarket040.RELEASE_NOTES, if available
                    SYS$STARTUP:A1V40START.COM

     5.7 Install Missing Images

           On startup, if any error messages are displayed relating
           to images that are not installed, use the Install utility
           to install those images before executing the startup
           procedure again. Images that you may need to install in
           this way are those referenced by optional products that
           you have integrated with the Office Server image. For
           example, the following command installs the image RDBSHR,
           which is referenced by VAX DATATRIEVE:

           $ INSTALL
           INSTALL> ADD SYS$SHARE:RDBSHR /OPEN /HEADER_RES /SHARED

           For more details of the Install Utility, see the OpenVMS
           documentation.

     5.8 Recompile Form Libraries

           If you are upgrading from Office Server Version 4.0 and
           you have compiled form libraries on your old system which
           are not replaced by the upgrade, you may see the following
           error message:

           Obsolete form library <name> please recompile

           If you see this message, recompile the form library.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              You must also compile application or site-specific
              form libraries, and your own applications.

              _____________________________________________________

           The following form libraries are compiled automatically:

           o  OAFORM

           o  SITEOAFORM

           o  MEMRES

              If you have added code or manual procedures to compile
              other form libraries, you must recompile them manually
              after the installation. Use the Precompile a form library
              (PCF) option from the System Customization Management
              (CSZ) menu. See the DIGITAL Office Server Managing from a
              VT Terminal (the V4.0 book).

        5.9 Migrating Your Customizations After Upgrading

              Immediately after installing Office Server Version 5.0,
              and before allowing your users to access Office Server,
              review your customizations to mandatory elements.

              You can rerun the CART after installing Office Server
              Version 5.0 using the Check Conflicts (CC) option from
              the Application Maintenance menu. When you run the CART
              from within Office Server, it does not produce the site
              elements report. It does produce the full and summary
              reports, and the CART resolution procedure, which are all
              stored as new elements in Customization Management.

              If you rerun the CART, it does not keep the previous
              CART full and summary reports. To keep them, use the
              Customization Management Copy (CO) option to save the
              elements with another name in the same area, for example,
              copy CM_CART_SUMMARY_V40$PRIMARY to CM_CART_SUMMARY_
              V40$PRIMARY_19SEP. All of the elements that you have
              already processed will have status code F.

              To review your customizations:

              1. From the Customization Management (CM) subsystem,
                 select each element marked as a mandatory change and
                 print the differences between it and the new base
                 element.

              2. Review the differences.

                 Note where new functionality has been added or changes
                 made. Note any symbol changes. Use the information in
                 your upgrade plan to make the changes necessary to get
                 your system running.

              3. Test your customizations and, if they work correctly,
                 move the elements back into the live area.

     5.9 Migrating Your Customizations After Upgrading


           4. Before allowing your users back onto the system, review
              your customizations to recommended elements in the same
              way as you reviewed the mandatory elements.

              If you do not resolve conflicts to recommended ele-
              ments, users may not have access to your customizations
              or will not have access to the full functionality of
              Office Server Version 5.0.

           5. Review conflicts with elements reported with status
              code D, see the Compaq Office Server Planning and Setup
              Guide. Status code D indicates a customization that
              calls an element which has been removed from Office
              Server Version 5.0.

              If the element that is called by your customized
              element has a status code of A, then no customized
              version of it exists. Your customization will fail
              if you delete the removed element, as described in
              Section 5.9.2. Edit the command procedure DELETE_
              OBSOLETE_FILES.COM so that these elements are not
              deleted. Use Customization Management to create a
              new customized element to replace the referenced base
              element that no longer exists in Office Server Version
              5.0.

              Use Customization Management to copy any elements
              reported with status code A into the development
              area. When you rerun the CART, these elements will
              be reported with status code H.

           6. You can now allow your users to access Office Server
              Version 5.0. When it is convenient, resolve the
              conflicts for informational elements.

     5.9.1 Running the CART Resolution Procedure

           The CART resolution procedure calls individual scripts to
           process each status code. The scripts are called CM_CART_
           SCRIPTn, where n is the CART status code.

           To run and edit the scripts called by the CART resolution
           procedure, you must have Application Maintainer privileges
           for the areas where the elements are stored. See the
           DIGITAL Office Server Managing from a VT Terminal (the
           V4.0 book). To run the CART resolution procedure use

     5-12 Postinstallation Tasks

 



                       5.9 Migrating Your Customizations After Upgrading


              the Execute procedure (EP) option from the Application
              Maintainer's Check Conflicts (CC) menu.

              To change the way that the CART resolution procedure
              handles elements with a particular status code, do the
              following:

              1. Enter the Customization Management (CM) subsystem.

              2. Use the Access base element (ABE) option to select the
                 CART resolution script.

              3. Copy the script that you want to change into the
                 development area.

              4. Edit the script using Customization Management.

              It is not mandatory to use the CART resolution procedure
              to resolve conflicts. If the script does not provide
              appropriate actions to resolve the conflicts at your site,
              then you do not have to use it.

              You can use the CART resolution procedure to resolve some
              of the conflicts reported with an informational status
              code. You should review the CART resolution procedure
              carefully before running it. Check that your customized
              elements do not call a removed element, see Section 5.9
              which describes how to resolve conflicts for elements
              reported with status code D.

        5.9.2 Deleting Obsolete Files

              A command procedure, DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM, is
              provided to remove the files that are no longer required
              by Office Server Version 5.0.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                Do not run this procedure immediately after running
                the CART resolution procedure. You must always
                review this file before running it. Check that all
                your customizations are working correctly and ensure
                that your customizations do not call any elements
                that will be deleted by this procedure.

                _____________________________________________________

     5.9 Migrating Your Customizations After Upgrading


           You can edit DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM to stop the
           deletion of certain files if required, for example, if
           one of your customizations calls an element that has been
           removed from the base kit and which would otherwise be
           deleted by this procedure.

           For example, the suggested resolution for elements with
           status code A is to:

           o  Run the CART resolution procedure to delete the records
              for these elements from the Customization Management
              databases

           o  Run the command procedure OA$LIB:DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM
              to delete the elements

           To run DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM, enter the following from
           DCL:

           $ @OA$LIB:DELETE_OBSOLETE_FILES.COM language

           where language is the language of the Office Server
           system. If you have additional languages installed on your
           system, you can run this procedure for each additional
           languages.

     5.9.3 Replacing the Help Modules for Your Application

           For more information about customizing Help, see the
           ALL-IN-1 Application Programming: Guide.

           After the upgrade, copy the Office Server Version
           5.0 standard Help libraries, OA$LIB:OAHELP.HLB and
           OA$LIB:SITEHLPSOURCE.HLB from the base area to the live
           area, OA$SITE_LIB_language. Customization Management will
           inform you that the live and development versions of the
           Help libraries are the same and ask you whether you wish
           to continue. Answer yes to continue.

           You must recreate your customizations to Help modules
           using Customization Management. Use the Access base
           elements (ABE) option to get the base version of your Help
           module. Use the Copy (CO) option to copy the customized
           module to the development area where you can make changes
           to it. When you save the module Office Server formats
           it and puts it into the appropriate development Help

              libraries. When you have tested the Help, mark it to be
              moved to the live area so that it can be used.

        5.10 Migrate SITELINK40 Using Customization Management

              The SITELINK50.COM file is under the control of Customization
              Management. It is important that you check that any
              customizations to SITELINK40.COM are compatible with
              SITELINK50.COM.

              Use Customization Management to edit the base template
              version of the site link file, SITELINK50.COM, to include
              your previous SITELINK40.COM from OA$SITE_BUILD. Review
              your customizations to SITELINK50.COM and then move your
              customized version to LIVE. Review your customizations to
              make sure they are compatible with Office Server Version
              5.0. Do not relink Office Server until you have done this.
              See Section 5.9.

              It is recommended that you do the following to relink:

              $ SET DEFAULT OA$BUILD_SHARE_ARCH
              $ @OA$BUILD:A1LNKDRV

        5.11 Link Office Server to Include Code-level Customizations

              Office Server Version 5.0 is linked during the instal-
              lation without any customizations you may have made
              to your existing system. Therefore, it is important to
              relink Office Server after the installation if you wish to
              link with your customizations when you have checked them.
              See Chapter 2 of Compaq Office Server Planning and Setup
              Guide.

     5.13 Setting up Remote Mail When Using Message Router

           After the installation, local mail is already set up. If
           you want to use Message Router for remote mail, you may
           need to do some or all of the tasks listed in Table 5-3,
           depending on the requirements at your site.

           The tasks that you must do depend on the type of remote
           Message Router which can be:

           o  Installed on a VAX node in the same VMScluster:

              -  With Office Server installed on the Message Router
                 node

              -  Without Office Server installed on the Message
                 Router node

           o  Installed on a VAX node that is not in the same
              VMScluster as Office Server

           If you are using a remote  Section 5.13.1
           Message Router server
           node, make sure that
           there is a mailbox entry
           on that node for your
           Office Server mailbox.

           You may have already
           done this as part of your
           preinstallation tasks.

           If you have installed      Section 5.13.2
           Office Server Version 5.0
           on a mixed architecture
           cluster, you must modify
           the mailbox entry on the
           Message Router node.

        5.13.2 Modifying the Message Router Mailbox Entry

              You must modify the Message Router mailbox entry if you
              have a mixed-architecture cluster and you are using a
              Message Router in the same cluster. The installation
              procedure creates a mailbox entry on the Message Router
              node with the /OWNER=ALLIN1 qualifier. The Alpha node will
              be unable to connect with this mailbox because the /OWNER
              qualifier is on the mailbox. Modify the Office Server
              mailbox entry on the Message Router node to remove the
              qualifier.

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:MBMAN
              MRM> MODIFY A1/NOOWNER
              MRM> EXIT

              where a1 is the name of the Message Router mailbox.

        5.13.3 Configuring the VMSmail Gateway for Remote Access

              If you have installed the Message Router VMSmail Gateway
              on one of the nodes in a VMScluster you can set up other
              Office Server nodes so that they can access it.

              On each of the nodes that does not have the gateway
              started, define the logical name MRGATE to the following:

              node::MR%

              where node is the node where the gateway is running.

              You can also use a VMSmail Gateway on a node in your
              network, that is remote to your cluster. You need Message
              Router to be installed on one of the nodes in your cluster
              in order to do this. Make an entry for the remote VMSmail
              Gateway in the mailbox directory of the Message Router
              Transfer Service on the VAX node in your cluster that is
              running Message Router:

              1. Log in to the MBMANAGER account on the VAX node in your
                 cluster that is running Message Router

              2. Enter the following commands:

                 $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:MRMAN
                 MRM> ADD MRGATE/REPLACE="MRGATE @node"

                 where node is the node where the gateway is installed.

           See the Message Router documentation for more information.

     5.13.4 Setting Up the Message Router Directory Service as the
            Mail Directory

           The tasks that you need to do depend on the following:

           o  If the Message Router node is in the same VMScluster
              and has Office Server installed, see Section 5.13.4.1.

           o  If the Message Router node is not in the same
              VMScluster or Office Server is not installed on the
              Message Router node, see Section 5.13.4.2.

     5.13.4.1 Message Router is in the Same VMScluster

           Read this section if Office Server is installed in the
           same VMScluster as Message Router and Office Server
           is installed on the Message Router node. You can be
           using the Mail directory as either the primary or the
           secondary directory. If, during the installation, you
           chose to use the Mail directory as the primary directory,
           OA$DIRECT_PRIME is set to 2. If, during the installation,
           you chose to use the Mail directory as the secondary
           directory with Office Server as the primary directory,
           then OA$DIRECT_PRIME is set to 1.

           After installation, the following values are set up:

           o  A user agent entry name and password.

              -  The user agent entry name is OA$node$ALLIN1 for a
                 new or upgrade installation, where node is either
                 the node name or the cluster alias for the system on
                 which you are installing Office Server. For example,
                 OA$LYNX$ALLIN1.

              -  The user agent entry password is the Mail directory
                 password that you entered during the installation.

           o  A subscriber entry for the Office Server manager.
              The proxy attribute of the subscriber entry is the
              name of the local Office Server user agent entry
              (OA$node$ALLIN1). This attribute gives Office Server

                 Server can update and access the entry.

              o  UAPASSWRD.DAT which contains the name of the user agent
                 object and the user agent password, from the first item
                 in this list.

              When you set up the Mail directory the values in the
              previous list are updated.

              To set up the Mail directory, do the following:

                   you specified, for example, OA$nodename$ALLIN1.

                o  /PROXY="uaname" grants the local Office Server
                   user agent proxy access to the manager's
                   subscriber entry. This enables the Office Server
                   user agent to access and update the manager's
                   subscriber entry on behalf of the manager.

                o  /SUBID="uaname" identifies the Office Server
                   manager's subscriber entry to Office Server, as
                   there can be many entries called MANAGER.

        5.13.5 Remote Message Router Directory Service Startup
               Procedure

              On each Office Server node that will be using a remote
              Mail directory, add the following entry to your site-
              specific startup procedure before the entry for the Office
              Server startup procedure:

              $ @SYS$STARTUP:DDS$STARTUP.COM node nodenumber

              where node is the name of the node on which the remote
              Message Router is installed and nodenumber is the
              Directory Service node number of the remote node.

              To find the Directory Service node number, do the
              following on the Message Router node:

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:MBMAN
              MBMAN> SHOW DDS NODE nodename

              where nodename is the name of the Message Router node.

              See Section 5.4 for more information about editing the
              site-specific startup file.

     5.14 WPS-PLUS Login Command Procedure


     5.14 WPS-PLUS Login Command Procedure

           During the Office Server Version 5.0 installation
           procedure, a login command procedure, A1WPSPLUS_LOGIN.COM,
           is created in SYS$MANAGER. Add this to the system login
           command procedure, SYS$SYLOGIN, if you want all users to
           run with these qualifiers. Alternately, you can make the
           file available to users to put into their own LOGIN.COM
           files.

     5.15 Moving the CDA DOC_STYLE Files

           If CDA$LIBRARY does not exist on your system, the CDA DOC_
           STYLE files are installed in OA$LIB_SHARE. Move the files
           to a suitable location.

     5.16 Adding the ADMIN Form Library for AIDA Library Searches

           If you have upgraded from an Office Server Version 4.0
           system that has created a new AIDA library search order in
           OA$LIB:AIDA.A1$LSO, you may need to perform an additional
           postinstallation task.

           When this file OA$LIB:AIDA.A1$LSO is present, AIDA Servers
           on the system use the form libraries listed in this search
           order rather than the standard form libraries. If you are
           using the default search order, you do not need to take
           any action as the default search order now includes the
           ADMIN form library.

           If you are using OA$LIB:AIDA.A1$LSO to define AIDA library
           search orders, you must add the ADMIN form library to the
           list. See the section Accessing Additional Form Libraries
           in the Managing AIDA Servers chapter of DIGITAL Office
           Server Managing from a VT Terminal (the V4.0 book).

                         Office Server Version 5.0 Files and Directories



              This appendix lists the files that are installed in
              directories other than the Office Server directories.

        B.1 Files in the Office Server Kit

              For a complete list of all Office Server directories and
              file names when the installation is complete, use the
              following command for each Office Server area:

              $ DIR/SEC[a1dir...]*.*/out=a1dir.TXT

              where a1dir is the top level directory name for each area
              (for example OFFICE.DIR).

              The list of files is a useful reference if you need to
              resolve any problems with file protections or ACLs.

        B.2 Files Installed in Non-Office Server Directories

              The following list shows the files that are installed
              in directories other than the Office Server directories.
              Where language is included in a file name, this is the
              name of the installed language, for example, ENGLISH.

                                        Information on Market Components



              If your Office Server license and support agreement are
              for a market component other than the US or GB components
              with the English language kit, you can find the market
              information that you need in this appendix. You can
              install the market component from the Office Server media.

              For information on the US or GB components, see Appendix C

              The Office Server installation procedure prompts you for
              the two-letter market code for the market component that
              you want to install. Follow the installation procedure
              described in Chapter 2.

              For all market components, the keyboard mapping tables are
              invoked by entering:

              $ OFFICESERVER/KEYBOARD=keyboard_mapping

              where keyboard_mapping is the identity of the required
              keyboard. A list of these keywords is held in OA$DATA_
              SHARE:OA$KEYBOARDS.DAT (see DIGITAL Office Server Managing
              from a VT Terminal).

              Each of the kits has three savesets:

              o  A1Cmc050.A

              o  A1Cmc050.B

              o  A1Cmc050.C

              where mc is the two-letter market code defined in the
              tables in this chapter, for example, BE for the Belgian
              market component.
